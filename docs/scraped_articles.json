We have adhered with both the Nigerian and International Laws guiding the agitation for Self-Determination.\n\n\u201cAll our agitations have been peacefully, orderly, and lawfully executed. We have commended the officers of the Nigerian Police many time for being professional in their modus of operations in relating to our protests and rallies for Self-Determination in Yoruba cities.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I say on behalf of the Yoruba people that this attack on Chief Ighoho\u2019s house was unnecessary, unfortunate, wicked, callous, cruel, irresponsible, illegal and atrocious.\n\n\u201cWe are holding the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration responsible for this barbaric attack. This is a declaration of war against peace-loving people.\n\n\u201cI call on our people across at home and in diaspora to immediately begin Mass Protests In Front of Palaces in Yoruba Land, and opposite the offices of the United Nations, European Union, British, French and United States Governments.\n\n\u201cWe want to confirm again that the Pro-Yoruba Nation rally scheduled to hold on Saturday July 3rd, in Lagos will proceed as scheduled.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Gov can do better.\u201d\n\n@OgbeniDipo: \u201cIf the Government continues to chase people like Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho, but negotiate with bandits and terrorists from Northern Nigeria, people will ask questions.

Chasing activists cum secessionist leaders with Federal resources is exactly how to make them more popular & solidify their cult followership. First Nnamdi Kanu, now Sunday Igboho\u2026these people never learn smh!\u201d\n\n@ayemojubar: \u201cThis is the main reason more people might be present at the rally.

The FG has done its worst again.\n\nCan you see the whole house stained with blood? They killed our people and took their corpses away so that there won\u2019t be proofs that they killed them. They have called for war and they will witness it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIgboho didn\u2019t do anything for them. How can Federal Government. All Yoruba people, don\u2019t sleep. If you say it won\u2019t get to you, it\u2019s already at your backyard. Igboho is fighting the cause of Yoruba people. All vehicles were riddled with bullets including the G-Wagon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wanted to prevent us from going to Lagos for the rally. They have failed. Is it a sin to say we want independence? Look at the ceiling. Lady K and all the media team were we whisked away. All you Yoruba who are saying politicians are the ones using Igboho, have you seen it\u201d?\n\nAnother source told Vanguard that one man praying on the mat was killed and another person was killed in the bathroom.\n\n\u201cWe are not in totalitarian regime\u201d YCE\n\nReacting to the invasion, the Senior Elders Forum of the Yoruba Council of Elders through a former National President, Dansaaki Samuel Agbede wondered if the country is being run by a totalitarian.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want all this violence. This government propelled problem is a big worry for Yoruba leaders. Where do we go from here? We have said it several times that our youths are hungry and angry. They should opt for a dialogue rather than this confrontation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is always a root cause for every issue. Let\u2019s sit down to talk it over. We don\u2019t want our children being wasted. It\u2019s a problem bothering everybody not only Sunday Igboho. He is just an individual. It is an issue we should address instead of trailing an individual for elimination\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are not in totalitarian regime. This is not an answer to this problem. It will only escalate it: it won\u2019t solve the problem. The government can\u2019t rule people by the gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to plead with the government. This is a problem affecting a lot of people. Igboho is only talking loud. There are people who are growling in anger and they don\u2019t know how to express themselves\u201d.\n\nAs at 10am on Thursday, Vanguard gathered that no police presence at the spot.\n\nWhen Vanguard called the Oyo State Police command for comments, several calls made to the Public Relations Officer, DSP Adewale Osifeso were not picked.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli and Onyedi Ojiabor, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has offered insights into the operation that led to the rearrest of detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nIt said some countries and intelligence agencies, with which it has obligations, assisted to arrest Kanu.\n\nBut the government did not name the affected countries or intelligence agencies.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed who spoke with reporters in Abuja simply described those countries and Intelligence agencies as those with which Nigeria shares obligations.\n\nHe said: \u201cFinally, there have been speculations on how this re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed.\n\n\u201cWhat we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations. We continue to respect and honour the obligations. \u201d\n\nRead Also: Security probes Kanu to uncover IPOB financiers\n\nHe said Nigeria had been on the trail of Kanu for two years.\n\nAccording to him: \u201d It will interest Nigerians to know that for over two years, our security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of the proscribed IPOB leader as he lived a five-star life across several countries, travelling on chartered private jets, living in luxury apartments and turning out in designing clothes and shoes.\n\n\u201cOf course, as we all saw, he was wearing an attire made by Fendi, a luxury Italian fashion brand, when he was arrested.\u201d\n\nMohammed explained that many security agencies worked to effect the arrest of Kanu.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs you are aware, the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, has been rearrested and repatriated to Nigeria to resume his trial.\n\n\u201cThis was made possible through the collaboration of Nigerian security and intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cKanu, who is facing an 11-count charge of treason, treasonable felony, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms, among others, jumped bail in 2017 and left the country.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, Kanu was re-arraigned in court and ordered to be remanded in the custody of the DSS, while the case was adjourned till July 26-27, 2021\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGentlemen, the Federal Government wishes to commend the Nigerian security and intelligence agencies, who collaborated to re-arrest the proscribed IPOB leader in one of the most classic operations of its type in the world.\n\n\u201cWe commend the professionalism, diligence, patriotism and painstaking efforts of our security and intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cWe also thank the sister international agencies that collaborated with us to pull off this arrest.\u201d",

          "title": "Kalu\u2019s magic wand in Abia North",
          "text": "From Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nHow many times would a man kill lions before he is addressed as \u201cOgbuagu\u201d (killer of lions)? Answer: Killing just one lion earns him the sobriquet.\n\nPrior to Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu\u2019s election in 2019 to represent Abia North senatorial zone in the Senate, the zone had been represented by persons who give head pans, shovels and hair driers to the constituents as democracy dividends. But, with the election of Orji Kalu, former governor of Abia State and current Senate Chief Whip, into the Senate to represent Abia North, the narrative changed. Kalu has \u2018killed\u2019 so many lions on this front that he cannot only be said to be Ogbuagu, but at the same time feathers surely must be competing for space on his red cap, going by the accolades he has received from his constituents.\n\nWhile Kalu traversed the length and breadth of the zone during electioneering, he promised the people a new dawn, if elected. And, true to type, he has delivered on his promise.\n\nNicknamed Action Governor by a former President of the country when he superintended the affairs of Abia, he has brought again brought action to the people of Arochukwu, Bende, Isuikwuato, Ohafia and Umunneochi, the five local government areas that make up Abia North.\n\nArochukwu LGA\n\nMassive roads reconstruction is going on simultaneously in the five local government areas of Abia North senatorial zone, courtesy of Kalu\u2019s political dexterity. According to the Ogbuagu himself when he inspected some of the ongoing road projects recently, at least 32 of such roads have either been completed in the area or have reached advanced stages. Not given to taking credit for what others did, Kalu disclosed that, out of the roads in question, 21 were his constituency projects, while the remaining were being handled by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), also through his intervention.\n\nSome of the roads that the Senate Chief Whip facilitated and had been completed in Arochukwu include the 3.2-kilometre Atan Ihechiowa Road, which the senator himself recently inaugurated.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Kalu said the facilitation, construction and inauguration of the road was in fulfillment of part of his 2019 campaign promises to the people.\n\n\u201cThe 3.2km Atan Ihechiowa Road is one of the 19 road projects in Abia North facilitated by me within my first term at the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cLast time I came during the campaign, my vehicles were all covered with dust, and I made a promise to all of you that I would facilitate the construction of this road, and this is what we are witnessing today. Apart from this road, the construction of a 7.9km Opkor/Arochukwu Road is also ongoing. I don\u2019t believe in politics of cash inducement or distribution of materials that are not tangible,\u201d Kalu told the people.\n\nAs the Atan Road was being launched, the first phase of the 2.5km Orir-Ikot Okpura-Arochukwu Road, which was attracted by the senator and undertaken by the NDDC, was flagged off to the admiration of the people. The flag-off was preceded by a reception hosted by the community and organized by Chief Eze Aru, a community leader.\n\nAn elated Chief Aru told Kalu: \u201cThis road is a product of Senator Kalu\u2019s ideology of sincerity in Nigerian politics. This has further proven that Senator Orji Uzor Kalu loves our community, because politics is all about meeting the needs of the people, and the senator has demonstrated this through the construction of this road.\u201d\n\nTraditional ruler of the community, Eze Livinus Nto Mba, Chief Onny Igbokwe, Dr. Chidia Maduekwe, Chief Samson Aku and Chief Chris Ajah, vice-chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia North, all eulogized the former governor, saying he was a symbol of a good representative.\n\nChairman of the APC in Arochukwu LGA, John Million, went philosophical, saying: \u201cSince the inception of the community, this is the first time we shall be seeing this type of infrastructure development like tarred road.\n\n\u201cWe have had senators previously who represented us at the National Assembly, but they did nothing for us. One of them distributed only frying pans and hair driers during his four-year tenure.\n\n\u201cBut, today, Senator Orji Kalu has proven them wrong by facilitating various infrastructure projects all over Abia North, not just Ihechiowa community. Today, Abia North stands out among other senatorial districts in Abia State and he has made us proud.\n\n\u201cHis achievements in less than two years in office have revealed to us that senators can construct roads. As a result of the road and other projects he has executed, our party, the APC, has witnessed an influx of new members.\u201d\n\nKalu has also undertaken the renovation of primary schools in Arochukwu council, one of which is the Agbagwu Primary School, Aro-Town, in Arochukwu LGA.\n\nBende LGA\n\nThe people of Bende are no less blessed in having Kalu as their senator. A good number of roads he facilitated in the area have been rehabilitated, while others are undergoing reconstruction. Some of these roads include Igbere/Umuhu Ezechi, Alayi/Ugwueke/Ezeukwu and Lohum/Nkpa roads. Others are the Ukwu Rubber/Amaokwe Item, Amaokwe-Amaeke-Akanu Item and the Amankalu-Alayi/Akoli Imenyi roads.\n\nWhile inspecting some of the road projects, the Chief Whip announced that the original stretch of the Amankalu-Alayi/Akoli Imenyi Road has been extended from two to three kilometres. The first phase of the project involves a two-kilometre asphalting of the road with drainage on both sides. He said that work was going to commence on the second phase, which will take the road reconstruction to Akoli Imenyi.\n\nKalu told the people that he had concluded arrangement with the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) to do emergency repairs on the Alayi-Item-Nkporo Road, which he built when he was governor.\n\nChief Jones Udeogu, coordinator of Kalu\u2019s project monitoring team, urged youths in the area not to make trouble, but support the contractor to ensure the work is delivered on good time.\n\nAbia State secretary of the APC, Perfect Okorie, commended Kalu for fulfilling his campaign promises. Okorie, who is from the area, said his people will not forget Kalu in a hurry as they have been finally remembered after much neglect.\n\nEze J.K. Abba, chairman of Alayi Council of Traditional Rulers, said the event was what his people have been angling for, but have been disappointed by past representatives of the people. He added it was only Kalu that has remembered them, and promised that his people would reciprocate the senator\u2019s gesture by giving him support in all his political endeavours.\n\nKalu has not been found wanting in the educational sector in the local government area. Courtesy of his political sagacity and connection, OUK, as he is fondly called, facilitated the rehabilitation of some classroom blocks in the area. Some of the schools are Ozuitem Central School, Okafia Igbere Primary School and Item Central School, Okoko. Kalu, while inspecting the school, regretted that it was renovated last when he was governor, over 20 years ago.\n\nThe senator went further to fulfill his promises of providing furniture for the pupils of Okafia Igbere and Item Central schools. While performing the delivery of several three-seater desks to the two schools, his legislative assistant, Mbila Uma Ayi, noted that the donations were part of his principal\u2019s policy to facilitate and provide conducive academic environment for Abia North pupils and teachers.\n\nIsuikwuato LGA\n\n\u201cIn Isuikwuato LGA, we have three road projects going on at the same time with that of Ohafia. I urge all Abians to continue to join the APC, that they will never be disappointed under the leadership of Senator Orji Uzor Kalu,\u201d said Chief Ajah of the APC, while commenting on the good works of Kalu. The roads under construction in Isuikwuato are the 2km road with drainage and asphalt in Uturu Township in Isuikwuato. Also on Kalu\u2019s construction radar is the 1km extension rural road with drainage and asphalt from Ozara junction to Umuasu (junction of University Road).\n\nIsuikwuto also benefitted from Kalu\u2019s renovation of primary school blocks, which included the rehabilitation of two school blocks at Otamkpa Community School and Ahaba Imenyi Community School.\n\nOhafia LGA\n\nOhafia LGA is in no way left out of Kalu\u2019s roads rehabilitation revolution. Some of the roads under reconstruction in the area include the Akanu Ukwu-Abia, Arochukwu Road Junction-Isiugwu and Okunoaku roads as well as the Amurie Nkopro-Abiriba Road.\n\nThe former governor said, apart from roads, the APC-led Federal Government was also involved in the rehabilitation of schools and provision of other dividends in the area. He urged the people to keep faith with the government at the centre as more goodies would come their way in the days ahead.\n\nOther democracy dividends Ohafia LGA people are getting through Kalu\u2019s quality representation are the Amurie Nkporo water project, where Kalu told the people that, because of the topography of the area, he had to invite Julius Berger to sink the borehole. Kalu, who noted that another motorized borehole was being sunk at Agbaja Ndiagbo, equally informed the people that one more would be sunk in another part of the community.\n\nApart from roads, Kalu\u2019s magic wand is felt in the area of education in the council as classroom blocks at Ndi Agwu Abam primary school, Okweji Memorial School, Ozu-Abam, Ugwuafia Primary School and Kpoke Primary School have all received the senator\u2019s magic touch.\n\nUmunneochi LGA\n\nThe Lokpaukwu Road, and the 3km Uhaba-Akawa-Aroikpa roads rehabilitation are in process in Umunneochi. While a borehole is being sunk at Ezioba community, the rehabilitation of Umuelem Central School, Isuochi, and Eziama Community School, Nneato, are in progress.\n\nOutside the road and other projects that have been completed or at various stages of execution, Kalu caused many other projects, some of which had already been taken off, to be accommodated in the 2021 budget.\n\nThey are the construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Ututu to Isu in Arochukwu LGA; construction of 2km rural road with drainage and asphalt in Itumbuzo, Bende LGA; construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Apanu to Akanu in Item, Bende LGA; construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt in Uzo Rubber in Amaokwe Item in Bende LGA; and the construction of 2km rural road with drainage and asphalt, Amankalu Alayi to Akoli Imenyi, also in Bende LGA.\n\nOthers are the construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt in Amaoku Alayi in Bende LGA; construction of 2km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Abia to Akanu Ukwu, in Ohafia LGA; construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt at Isiugwu, Ohafia LGA; construction of 2km rural road with drainage and asphalt in Uturu Township in Isuikwuato LGA; construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Ozara junction to Umuasu in Isuikwuato LGA (junction of University Road); and the construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Ndi Uduma Awaoke (Chief Awa Kalu SAN Road) in Ohafia LGA.\n\nAlso on the list is the supply of motorcycles, sewing machines and generating sets for his constituents in Arochukwu, Bende and Ohafia LGAs, as those in Isuikwuato and Umunneochi LGAs had already received theirs last year. The packages also included supply of wound gel and gynecological (cervical cancer gel) and the supply of rice and fertilizers for rural women in the five LGAs of Abia North. Investigations revealed that these projects cost over N2bn.\n\nA man not given to discrimination, the Senate Chief Whip included in this year\u2019s federal budget the construction of students\u2019 hostel in Holy Rosary Secondary school, Umuahia, which is in Abia Central senatorial district.\n\nMore constituents laud Kalu\n\nWhen Kalu toured the projects, which included roads, schools and water scheme, the people hailed, calling him such names as \u201cthe People\u2019s Senator,\u201d \u201cMan of the People,\u201d \u201cFather-Father\u201d and \u201cMaster Strategist.\u201d\n\nHear the Ezeogo of Abia-Ohafia community, Chief Emmanuel Ebere: \u201cSince the creation of the earth, this is the first time the people are seeing tarred road. The Premier of defunct Eastern Nigeria, Dr. Michael Okpara, and even the late Chief Sam Mbakwe, former governor of old Imo State, and some other governors, all came at one point or the other with promises to tar the road, but not until Kalu went to the Senate\u201d.\n\nEzeogo Ebere said his people were behind Kalu in his political endeavours.\n\nRt. Hon. Arua Arunsi, ex-Speaker, Abia House of Assembly and former member, House of Representatives, thanked Kalu for his quality representation. Commenting on the water borehole attracted by Kalu, Arunsi said it was the first time the people of Nkporo would have borehole water in commercial quantity and said the people were solidly behind Kalu.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nIndependent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has raised fresh alarms on security threat from activities of banditry and kidnapping in the country confronting the conduct of free, fair and credible elections.\n\nNational Commissioner and Chairman, Board of Electoral Institute (BEI), Mohammed Haruna, in his opening remarks at the annual Prof. Abubakar Momoh memorial lecture in Abuja, yesterday, said with the escalating insecurity, there was every reason to be concerned about the Anambra State governorship election and the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cElections can hardly be conducted where there is insecurity. Nigeria, as it is today, is facing myriads of security challenges and these have affected all facets of our daily living, making lives very unbearable for so many citizens. Banditry, kidnapping and activities of some dangerous elements in our society are posing serious challenges to our electoral and democratic processes.\n\n\u201cINEC, as an Election Management Board (EMB) is seriously concerned about the challenge all these pose on the delivery of its mandate, which includes the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in the country.\n\n\u201cThere are reasons to be concerned about the Anambra State governorship election and eventually the 2023 general election. To avoid any constitutional crisis, these elections must be conducted in line with the constitutional timelines.\n\n\u201cThis means we must do everything to remove the security or any other threat to the commission\u2019s commitment to the delivery of its mandate. Hence, the choice of the topic for this year\u2019s lecture.\n\n\u201cIt has become the tradition of the commission, through the electoral institute, to engage stakeholders that will do justice to any topical issue germane to elections. The institute creates avenues for this kind of interactions through policy dialogues, round-table series, focus group discussions as well as through the late Momoh lecture.\n\n\u201cThe institute has a very expansive pool of stakeholders. In this circumstance, the electoral institute is engaging security experts, media practitioners and people from the academia to do justice to this topic,\u201d he said.\n\nDirector General of the electoral institute, Sa\u2019ad Umar, said, \u201cSecurity issues in Nigeria today are highly multifaceted as they are multi-tasking. Before now, what we only grappled with was preponderance of political violence and thuggery in elections, the trend that led to a situation whereby the citizens of Nigeria were viewing elections and democratic processes with apprehension and anxiety.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate situation we are all facing today is that the security situation in the country has degenerated beyond the above-mentioned reckless manipulations, the politics of brinkmanship and subversion.\n\n\u201cThe constant fears expressed today by the electoral umpire, the electorate and the Nigerian citizens in general, are the possibility of insecurity at elections, banditry, kidnapping and the threat of highly dangerous criminal elements marauding the country as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

After my third appearance in the Supreme Court, I came out to speak to those who were present then. I told them that from 2003, I\u2019d spent 30 months in court.\n\n\"The President of the Court of Appeal, the first port of call for representation by presidential candidates then, was my classmate in secondary school in Katsina. We spent six years in the same class, Justice Umaru Abdullahi.\n\n\"My legal head was Chief Mike Ahamba, a Roman Catholic and an Ibo man. When the President of the court decided that we should present our case, my first witness was in the box.\n\n\u201cAhamba insisted that a letter should be sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to present the register of constituencies in some of the States, to prove that what they announced was falsehood. It was documented.\n\n\u201cWhen they gave judgment, another Ibo man, the late Justice Nsofor, asked for the reaction from INEC to the letter sent to them. They just dismissed it. He then decided to write a minority judgment. That was after 27 months in court.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Supreme Court. Who was Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN)? A Hausa-Fulani like me, from Zaria. The members of the panel went in for about 30 minutes, came back to say they were proceeding on break. They went for 3 months. When they came back, it didn\u2019t take them 15 minutes, they dismissed us.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, who was the CJN? Kutigi. Again, a Muslim from the North. After 8 months or so, he dismissed the case. Again in 2011, because I was so persistent, Musdafa, a Fulani man like me, from Jigawa, neighbor to my state, was CJN. He dismissed my case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken you round this to prove that our problem is not ethnicity or religion. It is ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe President boasted that in all the six years of his governance, nobody could accuse him personally of stealing and corruption.\n\n\u201cI refused to give up. I had tried to wear Agbada after what happened to me in Khaki. Something was done to me, because I did something to others. You know it. In the end, I myself was arrested, sent to detention, and they were given back what they had taken. I was there for three and a quarter years. This is Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI hope historians and intellectuals would document this, because it is a fantastic state of political development. Let our grandchildren and great grandchildren see how we came along. We didn\u2019t get it as easy as other people think. Not because God has given us great population and resources. We have suffered along the line.\n\n\"I try to mention these things because you got yourselves together, used your resources, energies without any input from me. I cannot thank you enough.

          "text": "\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has stated that the problem confronting Nigeria is Nigerians, and not ethnicity or religion as being opined in some quarters.\n\nBuhari noted that Nigerians should be blamed for the injustices rather than ethnicity or religion, not minding the complexities of the Nigerian condition.\n\nAccording to a release by the President\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President spoke while receiving members of the Muhammadu Buhari/Osinbajo Dynamic Support Group, who visited State House, Abuja, to present a compendium of five years achievements of the administration.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur problem is not ethnicity or religion, it is ourselves. After my third appearance in the Supreme Court, I came out to speak to those who were present then. I told them that from 2003, I\u2019d spent 30 months in court.\n\n\"The President of the Court of Appeal, the first port of call for representation by presidential candidates then, was my classmate in secondary school in Katsina. We spent six years in the same class, Justice Umaru Abdullahi.\n\n\"My legal head was Chief Mike Ahamba, a Roman Catholic and an Ibo man. When the President of the court decided that we should present our case, my first witness was in the box.\n\n\u201cAhamba insisted that a letter should be sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to present the register of constituencies in some of the States, to prove that what they announced was falsehood. It was documented.\n\n\u201cWhen they gave judgment, another Ibo man, the late Justice Nsofor, asked for the reaction from INEC to the letter sent to them. They just dismissed it. He then decided to write a minority judgment. That was after 27 months in court.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Supreme Court. Who was Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN)? A Hausa-Fulani like me, from Zaria. The members of the panel went in for about 30 minutes, came back to say they were proceeding on break. They went for 3 months. When they came back, it didn\u2019t take them 15 minutes, they dismissed us.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, who was the CJN? Kutigi. Again, a Muslim from the North. After 8 months or so, he dismissed the case. Again in 2011, because I was so persistent, Musdafa, a Fulani man like me, from Jigawa, neighbor to my state, was CJN. He dismissed my case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken you round this to prove that our problem is not ethnicity or religion. It is ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe President boasted that in all the six years of his governance, nobody could accuse him personally of stealing and corruption.\n\n\u201cI refused to give up. I had tried to wear Agbada after what happened to me in Khaki. Something was done to me, because I did something to others. You know it. In the end, I myself was arrested, sent to detention, and they were given back what they had taken. I was there for three and a quarter years. This is Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI hope historians and intellectuals would document this, because it is a fantastic state of political development. Let our grandchildren and great grandchildren see how we came along. We didn\u2019t get it as easy as other people think. Not because God has given us great population and resources. We have suffered along the line.\n\n\"I try to mention these things because you got yourselves together, used your resources, energies without any input from me. I cannot thank you enough. I\u2019m very grateful to you and to Nigerians because in 2019, I visited all the states, the people that turned out to see me across the country (because I\u2019m dedicated to serve Nigeria and Nigerians), the love is genuine.\n\n\"Thank God that over the years, they can\u2019t accuse me of corruption. And I\u2019ve been everything; Governor, Minister of Petroleum Resources, Head of State, President and in my second term. I thank you that nobody forced you, but you got together, used your energy, time and resources, I thank you very much. I assure you, history will do you justice,\u201d he added.\n\n",

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "Four years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\nIt was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May.\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans.\nGoing by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer.",

          "text": "In a fashion typical of African governments, authorities in the Kingdom of Eswatini have ordered network providers in the country to cut off access to the internet as a nationwide protest continues to rock the small southern African kingdom.\n\nDemonstrations demanding reforms to the country\u2019s absolute monarchy started during the weekend and things turned violent overnight on Tuesday as security forces fired gunshots and tear gas to disperse protesters, multiple reports show.\n\nActivists in the country are demanding democratic reforms and the lifting of bans on all opposition parties. They have said they will intensify demonstrations against the government, which have been on for four consecutive days now.\n\nVideos of people burning tires, throwing stones at cars, and barricading streets in cities like Manzini and Matsapha have also been circulating on social media.\n\nProtestors block roads in Manzini, King Mswati\u2019s Government blocks internet to control situation. pic.twitter.com/Pk9ao9duio \u2014 Swazi News (@SwaziNews) June 29, 2021\n\nEswatini protestors now operating at night burning businesses linked to King Mswati and Government properties.

Banks have also closed up until the unrest subsides.\n\nGovernment has further suspended schools & introduced a 6pm-5am curfew with immediate effect. Acting Prime Minister: \u201cAll offices should be closed by 3:30pm to allow workers to get home safely while essential workers will be required to produce a permit when travelling at night.\u201d \u2014 Eswatini Government (@EswatiniGovern1) June 29, 2021\n\nAnd in addition to these, the government has blocked the internet.\n\nESWATINI GOVT orders major network providers to cut internet connection, closes schools, imposes 6pm-5am curfew as protests continue. pic.twitter.com/wtMIEzte6u \u2014 Nation Breaking News (@NationBreaking) June 29, 2021\n\nOver the past few years, Africa has been plagued by social media and internet shutdowns in the run-up to elections and in response to protests or dissent.\n\nBetween January 2020 and February 2021, internet and social media blackouts were imposed in Uganda, Chad, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Nigeria restricted access to Twitter on June 4, albeit under different circumstances.\n\nInternet blocks on the continent prevent access to social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. In what is a worrying trend, local activists and international observers note that these blocks curtail the democratic right of freedom of speech and expression.\n\nAnger against Africa\u2019s last absolute monarch\n\nA former British protectorate, Eswatini is Africa\u2019s last absolute monarchy and one of the few remaining in the world. King Mswati III has ruled by decree for more than three decades, with unfettered political power over his 1 million people.\n\nThe royal family has come under fire for their lavish spending while most inhabitants, who are subsistence farmers, live below the poverty line. Crowned in 1986 when he was just 18, the king currently has 15 wives who occupy several state-funded palaces.\n\nThe small landlocked country changed its name from Swaziland in 2018, a move that was seen as a step towards democracy. However, King Mswati III has reportedly been running a repressive government, with several reported cases of human rights abuse, and consistently evaded years-long calls for meaningful democratic reforms.\n\nDespite anger towards Mswati over the years, demonstrations have not been commonplace in Eswatini. This is because the kingdom has continually stifled dissent and protests, as well as banned political parties from participating in parliamentary elections since 1973. Still, the 53-year-old monarch has denied being an autocrat.\n\nSeveral opposition leaders and activists were arrested in 2019, the same year when civil servants in the country went on several strike actions, accusing the monarch of draining public coffers at the expense of his subjects.\n\nThe series of crackdowns has done little to discourage anti-monarchy sentiment among the people as they continue to demand a democratic government that will serve their interests. This culminated in the ongoing anti-monarchy demonstrations in many parts of the country.\n\nAmid the protests, reports say the king has fled to neighbouring South Africa although Eswatini\u2019s acting Prime Minister, Themba Masuku, denied the claims on Tuesday. It\u2019s unclear at the moment what the situation is in the country but the internet shutdown is only likely to worsen the crisis.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Supa Strikas to Startups, Tomi Davies\u2019 approach to Angel Investing",
          "text": "In 2001, Tomi Davies backed his first company \u2014 Strika Entertainment. At the time, he didn\u2019t have a name for what he was doing; he was just helping friends.\n\nHe\u2019d later learn that what he was doing was called angel investing \u2014 an individual providing financial backing for small startups or entrepreneurs, typically in exchange for equity in the company.\n\nWith this knowledge, he co-founded the Lagos Angel Network in 2012, and a few years after, the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nTwenty years after his first investment, TD, as he is fondly called, has gone on to make many more investments and build the angel investment space in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe problem I\u2019m still trying to solve is that of funding for every African entrepreneur\u2019s great idea.\u201d\n\nWe start out our conversation talking about his first investment in Supa Strikas, a popular comic I grew up reading.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did the investment in Supa Strikas happen?\n\nTD: It started with meeting a South African named Oliver Power, I was head of IT research at Marks and Spencer in the UK then. A few years later when we returned back to our countries, he and a few others approached me to tell me that they had come up with an idea to do a comic.\n\nIt was a superhero comic book that featured the likes of Shaka the Zulu, Mansa Musa and Alaafin of Oyo.\n\nIt sounded like a good idea but I had to ask them, \u2018How are we going to make money?\u2019 because we needed to raise some investment. They said we\u2019re going to use a different model, we\u2019re going to get sponsorship from brands. We\u2019ll be like Marvel comics.\n\nSo I went to Cape Town, we had lengthy conversations and concluded this idea won\u2019t sell. We pivoted to a soccer storyline. Africans love football. We created an all African football team called Supa Strikas. It turned out to be successful.\n\nI ended up with the Nigerian rights for Supa Strikas for my contribution. So I am Supa Strikas Nigeria. There\u2019s Supa Strika Nigeria and Supa Strika South Africa. I no longer have shares in Supa Strikas South Africa. We sold our shares to Moonbug and Moonbug sold it to Disney. That\u2019s the story of Supa Strikas.\n\nDA: Why Angel and not Venture Capital?\n\nTD: I live through my portfolio. That\u2019s what keeps me alive, that\u2019s what keeps me fresh. I like the flexibility of choosing what to invest in and following up with the founders.\n\nDA: How do you operate?\n\nTD: My primary organisation is Technovision Communications. It operates as TVC Labs, which is funded by the 22 partners of the Technovision syndicate. These partners include people like Iyin Aboyeji, Kola Aina and Olumide Soyombo.\n\nTVC Labs runs accelerator programs that identify different startups that we work with. Now my portfolio consists of about 18 active startups like Trove, BigCabal Media*, Flexiserve, Trueflutter, Kishi, doci healthcare and others.\n\nDA: What was the reason for founding the Lagos Angel network?\n\nTD: The Lagos Angel Network was a happenstance. In 2012, I was already involved in angel investing. I had recognised that this was what I was going to do for the rest of my life.\n\nI ran into Dotun Sulieman; Funke Opeke of MainOne, Fatunmata Coker, Demola Aladekomo of Chams, Gbenga Sesan of Paradigm initiative, Gbolahan Elias, Folabi Esan and a host of others. We decided to put some structure to this and we started the Lagos Angel Network. We began structured investing\n\nDA: What about African Business Angel Network (ABAN)?\n\n\n\nTD: After a while, there were about 5 angel networks on the African continent.\n\nWe started partnering with my friend Ben White who runs VC for Africa and we ran the African Early Stage Investment Summit. Eric Osiakwan ran Angel Fair Africa. Through these events, the Europeans heard about us and they invited us to Slush.\n\nSo we all went to Helsinki in 2015 for Slush. At Slush, they said we needed an African Angel network to create networks and to educate people on what angel investing is all about.\n\nMy big sister Candace Johnson just turned around and said to me \u2018you\u2019re going to be the President.\u2019 I looked around, I didn\u2019t know they had all agreed to this. I looked at Dotun Suleiman, he was my senior at King\u2019s college and we formed the Lagos Angel Network together. He was the person I was expecting to be president but he said this is all yours.\n\nSo as president of ABAN, I spent the next 5 years crossing Africa and building networks. We now have 50 angel networks around 33 African countries.\n\nI am personally responsible for initiating the angel networks in the Gambia, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa and the list goes on. In Nigeria, I\u2019ve been responsible for the South-South Angel Network, Abuja Angel Network and also in Lagos, the women\u2019s only angel network called Rising Tide Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s important at this stage to point out that at ABAN I have co-founders. They are Ben White, Rebecca Enonchong, David van Dijk, Alexandra Fraser and Christopher Campbell.\n\nI\u2019d like to give a special shout out to David van Dijk. He is the backbone of ABAN. He runs the foundation, ensuring everything is running smoothly.\n\nDA: What does it mean to be a part of ABAN and what has been the network\u2019s impact?\n\nTD: The future of Africa is being built by a generation of entrepreneurs that are using technology to provide innovative solutions to the people of this continent.\n\nAnd those who support that cause will have a return not just in social impact but also in financial returns. That\u2019s the fundamental belief of ABAN.\n\nAs a member of the network, what you\u2019re signing up for is that we\u2019ll provide human and financial support to those working on these solutions.\n\nAs for Impact, Let me just paint a picture. In 2015 there were 5 angel networks on the African continent. Let\u2019s assume that they had 10-20 members each, so that\u2019s 50 \u2013 100 members in total. In 2021, there are now 49 angel networks in 33 African countries and Even if they have an average of 10 members each, that\u2019s 490 members. That\u2019s more human and financial support.\n\nWe created the Diaspora Angel Network, to co-invest in the local angel networks. So if you\u2019re sitting in London and you want to invest, you can invest through these networks.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the adoption rate like in Africa?\n\nTD: That\u2019s a tough one. Adoption rates are low because it\u2019s not for the faint-hearted and requires patience. Most importantly, it requires a passion and dedication to the entrepreneurs themselves. If you do not have that love of seeing others succeed, then there are different ways to spend your time or money.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nTD: The way I pick startups is called the POEM Framework. It goes way back to when I left Marks & Spencer. I joined Ernst & Young, where I was the chief operating officer for its incubator program. The way we worked was by doing a lot of research, then experimenting and using the results to improve on the experiment. In today\u2019s thinking, that\u2019s best captured by Eric Reis in what he calls the lean startup product development methodology.\n\nOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\nThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\nFinally, you ask, is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also is the business model sustainable. Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\n\nDA: How do you invest, alone or along with others? Also, how do you find these startups?\n\nTD: I only co-invest post-revenue, seed stage. As for the startups, I find them, they find me.\n\nI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, I sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum.\n\nThis means I tend to have a lot of people looking for deals that I can participate in but more importantly, I now do what\u2019s called program orchestration. I try to stimulate thinking, through programs that develop entrepreneurs with organisation partners like Google and Microsoft. In these programs I find entrepreneurs. That\u2019s me finding them. Every other day, from different channels there are founders reaching out.\n\nDA: It seems like an endless stream, how does due diligence happen?\n\nTD: Due diligence depends on the stage. At ideation, we say no. We either provide mentorship or advisory. There are three types of due diligence we do.\n\nFinancial: Here we\u2019re asking how much are you making, is this sustainable, what\u2019s it costing you to acquire customers? Do the numbers make sense?\n\nLegal: Are you legally incorporated, are there agreements between the founders and employees.\n\nCommercial: What\u2019s the size of your market? Is there a market? What kind of competition do you have out there? Is your market growth rate positive? We look at IP ownership \u2013 how you develop your products.\n\nBefore that we\u2019re going to issue a term sheet. Typically if it\u2019s a slam dunk, meaning someone has invested in you before, we can get it done within 30 days. If it\u2019s a first time investment, then it can take up to 90 days.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other types of investors like Private Equity and Venture Capital?\n\nTD: I\u2019m the only person that I know that\u2019s crazy enough to say what I\u2019m about to say. I\u2019m an angel investor, I\u2019m also the chief investment officer for a Venture Capital, I sit on the board of a Private Equity company (MBO Capital). So we get along pretty well.\n\nDA: Hmm, all in one. So what have your exits been like?\n\nTD: There are different types of exits but in our continent, the only exit that\u2019s a real one is the acquisition exit. Just like Stripe acquired Paystack. Those are the typical exits you\u2019ll see.\n\nFor an early angel investment, you can expect anything from 20 to 50x return on investment. I\u2019d like to point out that for every good exit, there\u2019re at least ten bad ones. There are some deals I\u2019ve lost money on that I\u2019ve retained relationships with the founders.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s more than just about the money. The challenge is to build a better future, so as long as people are heading in that direction then it\u2019s your responsibility [as an angel investor] to support them. That\u2019s how I see it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have relationships to support you, you won\u2019t build good things. Exits are a good measure, but how I measure success is by those 15-18 founders that I\u2019m constantly helping to be better.\n\n\n\nTD: Are you focused on any particular sectors?\n\nDA: Yes. First tech-enabled businesses. My background is in tech, so that\u2019s the underlying thesis.\n\nThen there\u2019s the concept of essentials. We must all eat, so I invest in food and agriculture. Health, education and power are also part of essentials.\n\nThe next is primary things like transportation, logistics.\n\nThen we have the future of work. Anything that facilitates enterprise from a technology standpoint like the rise of Zoom in the past year.\n\nThose are the areas I focus on rather than sectors because I start from a tech enabled stand point.\n\nDA: What trends do you see?\n\nTD: In my space, the use of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are underrated. When you consider that the average home now has a 30 inch screen somewhere in it, the potential for that is limitless. We talk about the reason fintech exists is because people have smartphones. Well, they\u2019ll keep on making the screens better and more affordable. Currently because we\u2019re used to the broadcast model, we\u2019re not thinking about the interactivity that\u2019s possible. That\u2019s an opportunity I\u2019m seeing that I expect someone to take advantage of.\n\nImagine a solar based screen that you don\u2019t need to worry about charging. You can attach a router to it, so it\u2019s interactive. This means I can teach a school remotely \u2013 one to many not one to one like on mobile. It means I can also remotely manage staff.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about exotic technology but simple technology that exists today. The price points to knock them together today are high but if you look at the opportunity cost, there\u2019s alot to play for.\n\nThat\u2019s just one opportunity, I won\u2019t be surprised that a startup takes advantage of this as long as COVID keeps us out of each other\u2019s way.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve written a number of books, are you working on a new one?\n\nTD: Yes, I\u2019m working on one now, which should be done sometime in 2021.\n\nDA: Any hints on the name?\n\nTD: The working title is \u2019Conversations with an African Angel.\u2019\n\n*Tomi Davies is an investor in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "On June 19, 2021, the world commemorated the 7th edition of the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict in a bid to address the rising incidents of sexual violence cases that followed lockdowns, curfews, and quarantines caused by the pandemic, as reported by the United Nations (UN).\n\nUp until now, several global bodies have been actively involved in setting up solutions to protect millions of people, especially vulnerable groups like women, against abuse and related cases, particularly at a time when more people spend longer time online.\n\nAnnounced today, July 1, 2020, during the UN Generation Equality Forum held in Paris, is the public commitment of four of the world\u2019s largest tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Twitter \u2014 to make their platforms safer for women. This is done in a bid to tackle online abuse against women and promote gender equality.\n\nThe outcome of these commitments would be the introduction of new systems or upgrade of existing ones to make reporting abuse more effortless and improve the overall online experience for women and girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is interesting to know that this initiative, led by the World Wide Web Foundation, kicked off over a year ago to bring together stakeholders together to design solutions to address the challenge.\n\nEve Kraicer, Policy Officer, Gender and Data Rights at World Wide Web Foundation, explains to Techpoint Africa that during this period, the Foundation converged 120 experts from tech companies, civil societies, academia, and government of 35 countries to co-create solutions and prototypes to tackle online abuse.\n\nMeanwhile, the Foundation also sent out an open letter \u2014 co-signed by prominent women across six continents \u2014 to the CEOs of Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Twitter insisting that these companies must be deliberate about implementing processes that can lead to real change.\n\nIn the light of this, Facebook has formed a group of 12 nonprofit leaders, activists, and academic experts to help develop new policies, products, and programs that better support the women who use Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram.\n\nFollowing this, the social media company also announced the launch of Women\u2019s Safety Hub, an online space for sharing information about tools and resources \u2014 on safety, policies, trainings, and tools \u2014 for women. It will be specifically opened to women journalists, public figures, and abuse victims.\n\n\u201cTo keep women safe from abuse, exploitation, and harassment online and offline, we regularly update our policies, tools, and technology in consultation with experts around the world \u2014including with over 200 women\u2019s safety organizations.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with other leaders and companies in the technology space to make the internet a safer place for all women across the globe,\u201d Antigone Davis, Global Head of Safety at Facebook, states in an official statement.\n\nKraicer believes that this public announcement would make the companies accountable while making others step up to the challenge. However, she adds that her organisation will be tracking the companies against their commitments and receive reports annually on their progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile acknowledging the peculiarities associated with different regions, Kraicer assures that solutions that will be built are expected to take into consideration how women in different parts of the world interact with the Internet.",

The decision was made due to stakeholders\u2019 requests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven months and counting: The first deadline was December 30, 2020. With the new extension, an exercise that was to last two weeks would be seven months old.\n\nWhy? This time, the reason given is the rapid increase of enrollment systems across the country.\n\nThe joint statement by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) notes that in December 2020, there were 800 enrollment centres across the country; now, there are 5,410.\n\nSixth time\u2019s the charm? I want to say this is the last time we\u2019ll see an extension, but it seems the odds are not in Nigeria\u2019s favour.\n\nAs contained in the statement, there are now 57.3 million unique NIN enrollments out of Nigeria\u2019s total population, which according to World Population Review, is over 200 million.\n\nGiven the amount of time it took to enrol 57.3 million Nigerians, this might not be the last we hear of NIN-SIM linkage extensions\n\nThanks to some help: How private companies are changing the game for Nigeria\u2019s NIN exercise\n\nNigeria\u2019s struggle with digital identification is several years old. Read all about it here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEswatini\u2019s Internet shutdown\n\nWhat happened? Authorities in Eswatini have cut off citizens\u2019 Internet access due to reportedly violent democratic reform protests.\n\nEswatini is the only African country ruled by a monarch. Pro-democracy protesters are kicking against King Mswati III\u2019s 35-year rule and calling for constitutional reforms.\n\nAljazeera reports that the government deployed soldiers to enforce a curfew ordered by the authorities. However, eye-witness reports reveal that there have been violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers.\n\nThis is becoming a trend: The threat to citizens\u2019 digital rights is something we frequently see in Africa.\n\nImpact on the continent: In an age where economic and social activities are heavily dependent on digital connectivity, the cost of Internet shutdowns is too high a price for the continent\n\nResearch by Top10VPN shows that 23 Internet shutdowns in 14 countries globally cost $3 billion in 2021.\n\nZeepay raises $7.9M Series A\n\nSource: Technext\n\nGhanian fintech startup, Zeepay has just closed a $7.9 million Series A round.\n\nThe round was led by Impact Investment group, Investisseurs & Partenaires. Other investors include GOODsoil VC, JLD & MB Legal Consultancy, and Verdant Capital.\n\nWhat\u2019s the funding for? Per Technext, Paa Kwasi Yankey, Zeepay Chairman, says it will cover the startup\u2019s expansion into other countries, including making strategic acquisitions before the end of the year.\n\nZeepay is currently present in 23 countries, according to its website. It offers a variety of financial services, including mobile money, remittance payments, and micro-insurance.\n\nFintech startup dominance continues? Fintech startups continue to be a recurring theme in startup funding across Africa. However, Egypt seems to be breaking the dominance with several massive non-fintech related financing recently.\n\nWondering how dominant fintechs are in Africa\u2019s startup scene? Read this.\n\nSouth Africa creates a timeline for crypto regulation.\n\nIn a bid to better oversee the activities of cryptocurrencies, South Africa is creating a crypto regulatory framework in three to six months.\n\nBloomberg has it that South Africa is looking to regulate cryptocurrencies as a financial product.\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, the country would oversee crypto activities like any other financial activity.\n\nBut how? With know-your-customer (KYC)! The first move regulators will be making is implementing a KYC protocol across crypto exchanges. This way, the anonymity associated with conducting crypto transactions is eliminated.\n\nThere\u2019s still an issue of non-custodial wallets and decentralised exchanges (DEX)\n\nWhile KYC seems like a great idea, there are still ways of conducting crypto transactions and trades without a centralised exchange that monitors activities.\n\nConsequently, illegal activities can continue on those platforms. Do you think this is something regulators should look into? Let us know in the comment section.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s speedy regulation timeline is perhaps due to the alleged Ponzi scheme that led to the disappearance of $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoins reported by Bloomberg on June 23, 2021.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nNigerian health tech startup, MDaaS Global, raises a $2.3m seed extension, launches e-diagnostic feature.

          "text": "Diagnostic healthtech startup, MDaaS, secured a $2.3 million seed extension funding and added a new product feature to its array called SentinelX.\n\nEarly-stage VC firm, Newton Partners, led the round, with participation from CRI Foundation, FINCA Ventures, Techstars and Future Africa\n\nFounded in 2016 by Co-founder and CEO, Oluwasoga Oni, MDaaS is on a mission to create easy access to diagnostic and preventive care for Nigerians.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Oni revealed that the idea for MDaaS came when, as an MIT student, he and some classmates were asked to develop something that could impact a billion lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn to a doctor father who ran a 30-patient hospital and seeing firsthand the problem of finding good and affordable medical equipment, he knew just the right idea to run with.\n\nAlongside Opeyemi Ologun and Genevieve Oni, MDaaS Global was born. They began by bringing secondary medical equipment into Nigeria from the US, offering service support, and then distributing it to hospitals via outright sale, rent, or lease.\n\nThe founders ran with this business model for a while, until it occurred to them what the actual problem was.\n\nThey realised that purchasing medical equipment was a waste of money because, more often than not, patients couldn\u2019t afford to pay for services rendered.\n\nDeciding to change their model, they switched to building diagnostic centres in communities with inadequate clinical services and finding out the equipment needed by small and medium-sized hospitals in that area.\n\nTheir first diagnostic centre was launched in Ibadan, Southwest Nigeria. And since then, they\u2019ve built six other centres located in different Nigerian cities.\n\nThey have a wide range of medical offerings, from digital X-ray and ultrasound to electrocardiogram (ECG) and other laboratory services.\n\nThe idea for SentinelX came when the company was screening COVID-19 patients. They found out that although some patients didn\u2019t have the disease, they had underlying health conditions like high blood pressure that they weren\u2019t aware of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRealising the need for a customer-focused product, they built SentinelX, enabling users to run through a series of tests with 60 or 70 biomarkers to check for individual susceptibility to a wide range of diseases.\n\nFor a one-off payment of \u20a635,000 ($85.05), users can access a doctor for a year. Post-screening, MDaaS has a unique care plan to address customers\u2019 health concerns.\n\nCurrently, SentinelX is running in private beta, with plans for the product to go live in September 2021.\n\nThis funding will be channelled toward building more diagnostic centres in Nigeria.\n\nFor the big picture, the startup is looking to be one of Nigeria\u2019s three largest diagnostic centres.\n\nAlthough a timeline wasn\u2019t disclosed, MDaaS is considering a pan-African expansion, serving a million patients per year, and operating 100 centres across the continent by 2025.\n\nThough proper diagnosis plays a crucial role in preventing and curing diseases, the equipment necessary to carry it out is usually unaffordable for small and medium-sized hospitals in most African communities.\n\nWith more technological startups branching out to create a sustainable medium for diagnostics and healthcare, more people might have easy access in Africa.",

          "text": "After seven decades of wrestling with malaria, China on Wednesday dealt the final blow to the deadly disease, demonstrating that commitment to medical research and funding can halt a country\u2019s malaria scourge despite huge population size.\n\nThe Asian giant grapples with 1.4 billion population, a size seven times Nigeria\u2019s but that did not get in its way of ranking among 40 countries globally certified Malaria-free by the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nIts strategies are not out of this world. China offers a basic public health service package for its residents without charge, giving all and sundry access to affordable services for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria, regardless of legal or financial status.\n\nIt applied a multi\u2013sector approach that had 13 ministries health, education, finance, research and science, development, public security, the army, police, commerce, industry, information technology, media and tourism join stop malaria in its tracks in 2010.\n\nRead Also: US doles out $90m to tackle malaria in 8 disadvantaged Nigerian states\n\nTo reduce its malaria caseload, the country introduced the \u201c1-3-7\u201d strategy: \u201c1\u201d signifying the one-day deadline for health facilities to report a malaria diagnosis; by the end of day 3, health authorities are required to confirm a case and determine the risk of spread; and, within 7 days, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent further spread of the disease.\n\nChina, acknowledging that the risk of malaria importation may persist, to prevent re-establishment of the disease, the country has beefed up surveillance at-risk zones using regional malaria control initiatives.\n\n\u201cTheir success was hard-earned and came only after decades of targeted and sustained action. With this announcement, China joins the growing number of countries that are showing the world that a malaria-free future is a viable goal,\u201d Tedros Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general said congratulating China.\n\nCovid-19 appears to be the only disease that has been treated with a level of priority close to this in Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria loses $1.1bn yearly to mosquito bites\n\nMany pundits have argued that Nigeria could have shed considerable weight carrying the greatest burden of malaria globally; if it handled malaria in the manner Covid-19 has been treated.\n\n\u201cYearly in Nigeria, over 150,000 people die from Malaria. About 50,000 women die from pregnancy and childbirth yearly. Over 40, 000 children die from diarrhoea and other preventable diseases. 2,000 died from Covid-19,\u201d Ola Brown, founder, Flying Doctors Healthcare Investment Group, said in a tweet.\n\nAlthough malaria prevalence in Nigeria declined from 42 percent in 2010 to 23 percent in 2020, malaria is still endemic in the country.\n\nNigeria accounts for 27 percent of the global malaria cases and 23 percent of global malaria deaths based on the 2020 World Malaria Report by WHO.\n\nChristopher Ajufo, a Texas-based medical doctor urged that more countries facing shortages in resources such as Nigeria should place focus on health issues that constitute huge threats to public health like malaria.\n\n\u201cThere are more deadly infectious diseases in the African continent. Those deserve more attention. I wouldn\u2019t recommend giving the highest priority to COVID 19. More people will die of HIV and malaria this year on the continent, than could possibly be killed by the Coronavirus,\u201d Ajufo, said.\n\nAs of June 30, Nigeria has so far had 167, 000 cases of Covid-19 and 2,119 deaths.\n\nChina on the other hand is malaria-free and on the prowl for outbreak attempts. The feat comes as an offshoot of efforts invested in the past.\n\nPart of the ground laying done in the 1950s was to reduce mosquito breeding grounds and stepping up the use of insecticide spraying in homes in some areas.\n\nIn 1967, the Chinese government launched a nationwide research programme aimed at finding new treatments for malaria. This effort, involving more than 500 scientists from 60 institutions led to the discovery in the 1970s of artemisinin \u2013 the core compound of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), the most effective antimalarial drugs available today.\n\nIn the 1980s, China was one of the first countries in the world to extensively test the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for the prevention of malaria, well before nets were recommended by WHO for malaria control.\n\nBy the end of 1990, the number of malaria cases in China had plummeted to 117 000, and deaths were reduced by 95 percent.\n\nIn 2020, after reporting 4 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases, China applied for an official WHO certification of malaria elimination.\n\nNigeria\u2019s government aims to reduce malaria prevalence to a parasite prevalence of fewer than 10 people and mortality attributable to malaria to less than 50 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2025 as reflected in the new malaria strategic plan 2021 to 2025.\n\nIt can borrow a leaf from China on following through.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPort Harcourt \u2013 Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has threatened to depose any monarch and Community Development Committee leaders that attempt to extort money from companies handling government infrastructural projects.\n\nHe issued the stern warning on Wednesday at the flag-off of the construction of the Rumuepirikom Flyover in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the State.\n\nThe governor stated that any monarch from Rumuepirikom and other communities in the State who summons contractors handling government projects to his palace for the purpose of demanding for inducement will be deposed.\n\nHe also warned youths in the State to resist the temptation of disrupting government projects in their communities. According to him, the era when government winked at such act is over.\n\nThe governor has meanwhile advised Julius Berger and other companies handling construction work to ensure implementation of the local content component of the project.\n\nThe governor noted that Rumuepirikom is less known for criminal activities because the leadership of the community has sufficiently enforced good conduct among the residents.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ll not be a governor that will go and meet somebody in 2023 when I leave to complete my village road, no, I won\u2019t do that. Every road in my community, I must do it now. I am not forgetting any road. Julius Berger must go back and compete all the internal roads in Rumueprikom. You must also put street light.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when you are coming to us to campaign, don\u2019t come and tell us that you\u2019ll do roads for us. You have not one to do. Don\u2019t come and lure us with roads because I am doing every roads now.\n\nSome people say why are you doing flyover here, why won\u2019t I do flyover? Anybody who uses this road would know how congested this place is. If you\u2019re going to airport you\u2019ll follow here; whether it is Ignatius Ajuru University or the Rivers State University you must pass here. So, how can anybody who loves Rivers state say the flyover here is needless.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Governor Wike hinted that he will move the Slaughter Market to the Waterfront of Rumueme.\n\nHe also announced that appointment into boards of government parastatal will be after the ongoing project flag-off and inauguration. According to him, women will be favoured with such appointment particularly in Rumueprikom.\n\nThe governor declared that, when it comes to winning elections, no electoral ward in the State can match the voting strength of ward 9 in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area.\n\nGovernor Wike therefore, urged those nursing the ambition to run for governorship of Rivers State to learn how to curry the favour of voters in ward 9 of ObioAkpor Local Government Area to benefit from its strategic electoral role.\n\n\u201cFor all of you that are queuing up, saying that you want to be governor, hold on, Let me finish: let my community finish its turn. Allow us to enjoy the spoil of office while we are still in office. Thereafter, you can set your own agenda when you come into office.\u201d\n\nPerforming the flag-off, former President of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Onueze C. J. Okocha (SAN) described the Rumueprikom Flyover as a very important project that will offer utility service beyond the improved aesthetics and ease of movement it affords.\n\n\u201cThis Flyover traverses what I should say the third most important entry point into the city of Port Harcourt. Before we used to have the Ikwerre Road and Aba Road, now we have this Ada George Road which takes you into the city.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark project, it is the 9th Flyover project conceived by the governor. The last one, I\u2019m told will be at the Rumuokwurushi -Igwuruta Road -East -West Road Junction. All of us are proud and we commend you for your remarkable and landmark achievements as our governor.\n\n\u201cDevelopment experts and road policy analysts would tell you that flyovers and good roads help to improve not only the aesthetics of the city but also improve the easy movement of goods and persons.\u201d\n\nProviding the description of the Flyover, Rivers State Commissioner for Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi said the Rumuepirikom Flyover will be 820m long with a 293m suspended section, an approximately 30m wide carriage way and a total cross section of 44m.\n\n\u201cIn plain terms, it will have 8 lanes like all our other flyovers; 4 lanes above ground measuring 14.6m wide and 4 service lanes of same dimensions with 2 meters added for lay-bys It will be well lit. This project will be commissioned within the next 12 months, It will solve traffic challenges, drastically shorten travel time to and from the Port Harcourt International Airport Omagwa.\u201d\n\n...",

It means kerosene and diesel can be cheaper.\n\n\u201cWe plan to build all these small modular parks in strategic areas where trucks can drive-in and buy, this helps to cut about 30 percent of the cost,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nigerian Content Development Board (NCDMB) invested $15 million to acquire an equity stake in Duport Mid-stream for the development of the park. Duport Midstream is among the indigenous oil companies that were recently awarded one of the 57 marginal oil fields in the country.\n\nThis, according to the organisation, will enable them to further reduce their cost as they would be getting their gas and crude directly from the fields.\n\n\u201cWe bid for the marginal field to process locally. Our game plan is to have refineries and gas plants. Get the gas to power and put electricity in homes and industries,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said the state government is hiring forest guards that will be trained and armed to protect the state\u2019s endangered forest reserves for future generations.\n\nThe governor disclosed this during a courtesy visit by members of Nigeria REDD+ at the Government House, in Benin City.\n\nThe REDD+, which stands for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, is aimed at contributing to the fight against climate change by preserving forests in specific areas that are considered at risk of deforestation.\n\n\u201cWe are taking certain steps already in protecting our forests, but we need more support and guidance. Our forestry assets are among our greatest endowments. Why won\u2019t we protect it for our generations?\n\n\u201cWe inherited over 650,000 hectares of forest reserves, but today, we can\u2019t account for more than 135,000 hectares. Is that right? Everybody must come together and protect our forests.

          "title": "COVID-19: Nigeria has no access to vaccines, to begin manufacturing \u2013 Official",
          "text": "The Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora, has said on Thursday that Nigeria and many African countries have no access to COVID-19 vaccines, despite their availability in developed countries.\n\nMr Mamora said this at a virtual conference on \u201cNigeria and the Next Pandemic: preparedness, response and vaccines\u201d organised by The Conversation Africa.\n\nThe minister said Nigeria is focusing on vaccine development to cater for the shortage of vaccines in the country.\n\nHe said Bio-Vaccine Nigeria Limited, a joint-venture between the Nigerian government and a private firm, is working on manufacturing vaccines for the country.\n\n\u201cWe have every need to do that in light of what is happening in the global stage. Right now, a lot of countries in Africa and even Nigeria can\u2019t have access to vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe can only hope to get over that or we have our own manufacturing hub in Nigeria and that is what we are working towards achieving.\n\n\u201cAs many are aware, the world is facing inequitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, with Africa bearing the brunt of it. While countries in Europe and America are fully vaccinated as high as 50 percent of their population in less than one year, African countries are still around one per cent and faced with a scarcity of vaccines,\u201d the minister said.\n\nMr Mamora said the pandemic has created a sense of urgency around vaccine development and manufacturing in the African region.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have taken this opportunity to fully establish our capacity for vaccine manufacturing. We have been working closely with Bio-vaccines Nigeria Limited,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, said Nigeria will get 3.92 million doses of Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccines in July or August.\n\nPreparedness for future pandemic\n\nSpeaking on the preparedness of Nigeria for the next pandemic, Mr Mamora said the federal government is working hard to equip the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), through the basic healthcare provision fund.\n\nThe minister said NCDC will have access to 2.5 per cent of the 5 per cent of the funds earmarked for health emergencies.\n\n\u201cWe were not as prepared as we would have loved to at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the resources we had were based on previous investment in health security by NCDC.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking this opportunity, this moment of disruption, to build more sustainable and resilient systems for health security in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Mamora said though it is difficult to prepare for a future pandemic while still in the face of one, the WHO estimate, which states that the world faces a threat of pandemic every five years, is enough reason to prepare.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nHe said vaccine manufacturing is one of the key areas of preparing for future pandemics, adding that the country has leveraged on the COVID-19 to strengthen its health facilities.\n\nMr Mamora added that Nigeria has learnt a lot of lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and it will prepare the country for future pandemics.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther speakers at the conference are, Christian Happi, Professor of Molecular Biology and Genomics; Folashade Ogunshola, Professor of Medical Microbiology; Glenda Gray, Special Adviser, Medical Research Council; Oyewale Tomori, Professor of Virology and and others.\n\nThe conference also had in attendance representatives from the Federal Ministry of Health, health experts and scientists and other policymakers.",

          "text": "The Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU), has called on the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency in Kaduna State over the happenings in the sate.\n\nThe sociopolitical group said such declaration will reduce tension and crises orchestrated as a result of Governor Nasir El-rufai\u2019s anti-citizens policies, precipitating poverty and record of high level insecurity among other negative developments under his administration.\n\nAccording to a statement signed and issued by SOKAPU spokesman, Mr Luka Binniyat, on Wednesday, the union explained that, \u201cGovernor Nasir el-Rufai has become beyond reproach and defies every wise counsel on how to reduce tension and crisis in Kaduna state.\u201d\n\nIt also called on the President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly and the National Human Rights Commission to come to the assistance of Kaduna State and invoke relevant laws of the land, including the declaration of a State of Emergency in Kaduna State, adding that, \u201cIt has been proven beyond doubt that Governor Nasir el-Rufai is incapable of ruling Kaduna state without inflicting severe hurt to everything that stands for peace, justice and progress in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are also calling for assistance from the international community, International and local based NGOs and Human Rights Organisations, Civil Society, the Clergy, and all men and women of conscience to come together and ensure that justice is obtained for these poor students.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai and his government must also be held accountable for all the destructive and backward developments that have taken place in Kaduna state owned higher institutions since he raised students\u2019 tuition fees.\u201d\n\nThe statement, which followed the bloody students protest at College of Education Gidan Waya, also called for the immediate release of the 13 detained students and compensation paid to them for their illegal detention without trial.\n\nIt stated that, \u201cOn Monday, 28th June, 2021, students of Kaduna State College of Education (COE), Gidan Waya staged a procession against a shocking hike in the tuition fees of all government owned tertiary institutions in Kaduna state, including the COE, Gidan Waya.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe students were not armed, they did not attack any passersby and did not destroy any private or public property. The protest was peaceful and non-violent as collaborated by locals.\n\n\u201cGoing by the reports available to us, the military and other security personnel stationed in Gidan Waya had already appealed to the students to stay calm and find ways of relating their grievances to the right authority. It was then that a battle ready contingent of combined armed troops of soldiers, Mobile Police and Civil Defence Corps landed and started molesting the already upset students. In the process, live bullets were used to fire at the protesting students.\n\n\u201cAs the dust settled, one student lay cold dead after being aimed at and shot in the heart. Three other students were fatally shot and were rushed to the general Hospital Kafanchan where one of them died few hours later. There names are given as :Emmanuel Nathan and Abas Zakari both of them 100 level Students of the school.\n\n\u201cThe fate of the other injured isnnow wrapped in mystery. It is disputed whether they are alive of dead, as all entreaties by us to locate them before issuing this statement met with lack of cooperation from Hospital authority.\n\n\u201cWe are also yet to get the number of those who sustained other forms of injuries from the high-handedness of the military and are privately receiving treatments away from the gaze of the state authority.\n\n\u201cThis is because, after the shooting, the troops went berserk arresting students they could grab. So far, 13 students of the schools have been arrested. They are made up of 4 females and 9 males. Some of them said that they were in their rooms when their doors were broken into, beaten up, arrested and hauled into a waiting van and then driven to Kafanchan Area Command of the Nigeria Police Force some 18km away.\n\n\u201cThey have spent 48 hours without trial and without bail today Kafanchan Area Command of the Nigeria Police is very notorious for such human rights violations as we have pointed out over time. We are told they they are undergoing tuture and may be moved to Kaduna where they may charged for murder.\n\n\u201cThe intolerance of Kaduna state government to peaceful protest against its anti-people actions and policies is already documented in its misadventure with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) after governor Nasir el-Rufai\u2019s desperate attempts to stop its peaceful protest against mindless mass sack of its members failed in May, 2021.\n\n\u201cIn Kaduna State University (KASU), as a means of disallowing any form of disagreement against the hike in school fees by over 500%, parents are made to sign an undertaking that should their wards be involved in any protest against the school fee hike, they would summarily be dismissed from the university. Such is the extent that Kaduna State government can go to gag its citizens against a suppressive and exploitative policy.\n\n\u201cWith the hate and ill will that el-Rufai harbours against Southern Kaduna, it is not surprising that a peaceful protest against the same increment will lead to such a bloody crackdown.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Governor Nasir el-Rufai must take responsibility for the cold-blooded murder of these students. El-Rufai and his government must also be held accountable for all the destructive and backward developments that have taken place in Kaduna state owned high institutions since he raised students\u2019 tuition fees.\u201d",

We are told they they are undergoing tuture and may be moved to Kaduna where they may charged for murder.\n\n\u201cThe intolerance of Kaduna state government to peaceful protest against its anti-people actions and policies is already documented in its misadventure with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) after governor Nasir el-Rufai\u2019s desperate attempts to stop its peaceful protest against mindless mass sack of its members failed in May, 2021.\n\n\u201cIn Kaduna State University (KASU), as a means of disallowing any form of disagreement against the hike in school fees by over 500%, parents are made to sign an undertaking that should their wards be involved in any protest against the school fee hike, they would summarily be dismissed from the university. Such is the extent that Kaduna State government can go to gag its citizens against a suppressive and exploitative policy.\n\n\u201cWith the hate and ill will that el-Rufai harbours against Southern Kaduna, it is not surprising that a peaceful protest against the same increment will lead to such a bloody crackdown.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Governor Nasir el-Rufai must take responsibility for the cold-blooded murder of these students. El-Rufai and his government must also be held accountable for all the destructive and backward developments that have taken place in Kaduna state owned high institutions since he raised students\u2019 tuition fees.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU), has called on the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency in Kaduna State over the happenings in the sate.\nIt stated that, \u201cOn Monday, 28th June, 2021, students of Kaduna State College of Education (COE), Gidan Waya staged a procession against a shocking hike in the tuition fees of all government owned tertiary institutions in Kaduna state, including the COE, Gidan Waya.\nSuch is the extent that Kaduna State government can go to gag its citizens against a suppressive and exploitative policy.\n\u201cTherefore, Governor Nasir el-Rufai must take responsibility for the cold-blooded murder of these students.\nEl-Rufai and his government must also be held accountable for all the destructive and backward developments that have taken place in Kaduna state owned high institutions since he raised students\u2019 tuition fees.\u201d",

          "text": "The House of Representatives has again introduced a Bill seeking to alter the condition of service of parliamentary workers throughout the federation by increasing the retirement year from the age of 60 years to 65 years or from 35 years to 40 years in service, whichever comes first.\n\nIn the year 2020, controversy ensued over the condition of service for parliamentary staff when the former clerk to the National Assembly, Sani Omolori relied on a resolution of the 8th Assembly on the retirement age of the National Assembly staff and attempted to remain in office.\n\nThe National Assembly Service Commission (NASC), however, opposed the move, noting that the National Assembly Service Act, 2014(as amended), provides the retirement age of the staff of the National Assembly Service as 35 years of service or 60 years of age, whichever comes first.\n\nBut the new piece of legislation before the House at Wednesday\u2019s plenary seeks to amend the existing Act and give legal backing to a new condition of service.\n\nThe Bill is sponsored by the chief whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno.\n\nAccording to the long title of the proposed legislation, the Bill seeks to professionalise the service and to ensure the transfer of knowledge and experience by the top-level management staff who are on the verge of exiting the system.\n\nAccording to Monguno, by the time the current top-level management exits, most of the staff who came through federal civil service would have left service, it requires strong capacity and knowledge to pilot and stabilise the the bureaucracy, hence the five years extension remains a better option, as against hiring retired staff as consultants to do the same work they can do with just 58 years without additional cost and burden.\n\nHe insisted that the Bill would help build institutional memory and develop a career progression plan within the bureaucracy of the National Assembly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis hopes to lead to modest improvement in the condition of service of the staff, strengthen and reposition the legislative by laying a solid foundation for sustainable legislative bureaucracy,\u201d he argued.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

The preacher also brought up the biblical story of Joseph, who was imprisoned but favored by the jail wardens.\n\nMbaka also warned Nigerian leaders to do the needful, else there would be a revolution that the leaders will not be able to withstand.\n\nHe also said Nigerians have normalised suffering, which ought not to be because the country is blessed. He, however, noted that the citizens are experiencing suffering as a result of wickedness from those in government.\n\nHe said, \u201dThe God in him will be in the jail with him because he says when you are suffering, I am also suffering, he says when you are afflicted, God is also afflicted, a place where the state prisoners were confined, he was there in the prison, lift your hands, we minister to all the prisons in the universe, especially in our country where our people are, we minister speedy release.\n\n\u201cDo you know when Jesus was in the prison, a prison in the grave, they killed him and put him inside the grave, everybody thought it was all over? The end has come in the eyes of many but look at what the Bible says in Gen 39:21, but the Lord was with Joseph, anybody that you have in heart now and is in prison, may the Lord be with that person.\n\n\u201cThe Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy, may the Lord show our people mercy and loving-kindness and gave him a favour, may they receive favour, may the Lord give my people a favour.\n\n\u201cThe prison warden didn\u2019t pay any attention to the charges laid against Joseph for God was with him and he made whatever he did to prosper. Do you know someone can be in prison and his business is prospering elsewhere?\n\n\u201cThat is going to happen because of the power of favour. And the Bible says the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people\u2026God will hear us. The downfall of a man is not his end. My enemies, do not mock me because I shall arise.\n\n\u201cMy enemies, do not laugh at me because God is about to do something. When the Israelites were in bondage in the land of Egypt, because of them, a lot of catastrophes started happening.\n\n\u201cThat was how they carried the man Joseph and put him in the pit, did the end come? No. One day the king had a dream and only Joseph could interpret it.\n\n\u201cEach time I speak, I am being misunderstood but if our leaders will not be careful and do what they need to do to put Nigeria on a good platform, one day this country will collapse.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t do what they should do and the youths are suffering and they don\u2019t provide jobs and the leaders are busy amassing wealth, keeping money for themselves and millions of Nigerian youths are watching them, a time is coming when what we are experiencing now will just be a skit.\n\n\u201cThe generation of now are delivering children and their children are coming up, very soon, by the time the children are grown, they may not tolerate this nonsense because there is no country in the world that is as blessed as Nigeria yet our leaders are not ready to use the resources to take care of the children in this country.\n\n*Suffering has become part of our history but it will not continue like this forever. Everybody cannot be dumb at the same time, our suffering is very unnecessary, there is no reason why we should be suffering what we are suffering now apart from wickedness emanating from the portals of leadership.\n\n\u201cThere was no kidnapping in Nigeria, there was no banditry, hooliganism was at a miniature level. I knew when we were growing up, you can hardly hear that someone stole something. At that time, leadership was not to make money. There is no reason why this kind of trouble will be in a country blessed by God in this nature.\n\n\u201cI am seeing a time if the priests and men of God don\u2019t speak up, a time will come when we will be hearing that Bishop ABCD is arrested and cuffed and Priest will not talk. A time is coming when children of God will not have faith in their men of God, when you tell them \u2018the Lord bless you\u2019, they say \u2018forget it\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat time is coming when if we cannot speak for them now, they will not speak for us. That time is coming when offering baskets will suffer hunger because children of God will lose hope in their men and women of God.\n\n\u201cIf the men of God will not rise up and speak consistently for our youth, as I said, what we are experiencing now is nothing.\n\n\u201cSo, all those who are preparing for 2023 and seeing it as a time to launder wealth, money that should be used to develop the city, they had better stop.\n\n\u201cAnytime I speak about job provision, they begin to blackmail me, they don\u2019t know I am on earth for a mission, I shall be the hand for those who have no hands, I shall be the leg for those who have no legs, I shall be the voice for those who are voiceless, even when I want to keep quiet, I cannot because the Holy Spirit is using me.\n\n\u201cAgain, let our leaders do the needful because when the major catastrophe happens in the future, they will not be exempted. If they like, let them jail everybody, that is not the solution, let them feel the pains in the eyes of teeming Nigerians. Go to the north, people are suffering yet a few are millions in Dollars, the same with other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIntimidation will not solve the problem. I know that the real people who should be in prison are those arresting people and locking them up. I know that after this message, they will invite me again.\n\n\u201cThey are gradually succeeding in their gimmicks and tricks to make sure men of God are silent. Look at our medical experts, hot brains graduating from medical school, where do they work? Where are the facilities, how much does it cost? When they are sick, they fly out but when we are sick we are supposed to die here. Arrest is not the solution, there is agitation in the land. Let the leaders listen. Their stubbornness will one day crumble this nation. It is not about referendum.\u201d",

          "text": "Emperor Simon, Abuja\n\nThe Petroleum Industry Bill moved one step closer to becoming law after Senators on Thursday began to consider its provisions after a committee report.\n\nSenator Sabo Mohammed (Jigawa South-West) who chairs the Joint Committee on Petroleum (Downstream); Petroleum (Upstream) and Gas Resources presented the report of the committee.\n\nHe said the PIB is designed to update and replace the outdated provisions with a more comprehensive and current petroleum industry law that aligns with global standards.\n\nHe added that it also seeks to empower institutions and not individuals, remove bad governance which leads to inefficiency and corruption in the country\u2019s petroleum industry.\n\nSpeaking on the PIB, the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege said the bill will create an enabling environment for investors to come in and invest in Nigeria\u2019s oil sector.\n\nHe, however, appealed that the contribution of companies to a Host Communities Trust Fund be increased.\n\nThe committee had recommended that five percent of the actual annual operating expenditure of the proceeding financial year in the upstream petroleum operations should go to the Fund.\n\nOn gas flaring, Senator Omo-Agege was opposed to the use of penalty funds in development of frontier gas basins. He said such funds should be channeled into developing affected communities.\n\nAccording to him, the communities are the ones affected by gas flaring, and therefore whatever funds are raised from penalizing companies involved in gas flaring should be used for remediation purpose in affected communities by providing them hospitals and roads, among other basic amenities.\n\nThe Senator representing Niger East, Senator Sani Musa, however deferred on the observations made by Senator Omo-Agege, and appealed to the lawmakers to desist from rancour so as not to impede the passage of the PIB.\n\nBelow are some key points in the report of the Senate committee:\n\n1. Report prescribes amendments to a total of 752 provisions out of which about 56 are substantial amendments as recommended by stakeholders during public hearing\n\n2. The Committee recommends funding mechanism of 30% of NNPC Limited\u2019s profit oil and profit gas as in the production sharing, profit sharing, and risk contracts to fund exploration of frontier basins. The Frontier Basins are to take advantage of the foreseeable threats to the funding of fossil fuel projects across the world due to speedy shift from fossil fuel to alternative energy sources.\n\n3. The Committee recommends 5% of the actual annual operating expenditure of the proceeding financial year in the upstream petroleum operations affecting the host communities for funding of the Host Communities Trust Fund. (This is however a drop of 5% compared to the 10% recommended in the previous PIB submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari by the 8th Assembly which was not assented to)\n\n4. The Committee recommends 96 amendments to Chapter Four of the Bill for better and attractive tax incentives to achieve the goal of attracting the over 100Bn Dollars capital investment inflow into Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry.",

Section 156(i)(a) and third schedule, Part 1, Item F, Paragraph 14(1) of the Constitution have outrightly disqualified her.\n\nWe are, therefore, writing to ask the Chairman to save the Senate President, the Senate itself and Mr. President from being ridiculed.\n\nWe call on your committee to reject the nomination of Onochie because she cannot be neutral or independent as she is factually known to be an unrepentant card-carrying member of the APC with an uncountable number of proofs.\n\nHer confirmation will be a wholesome abuse of democratic tenets and dragging the reputation of the President and the Senate in the political mud.\n\nPlease, don\u2019t make an avoidable legislative and political mistake for the country.\n\nKindly, accept the assurances of our highest consideration and esteem regard.\n\nSen.

          "text": "At least 17 people were injured Wednesday night as a Los Angeles bomb squad botched the removal of improvised explosives seized along with thousands of pounds of illegal fireworks, officials said.\n\nThe blast blew the top off a bomb disposal truck and shot a fireball above the south Los Angeles neighborhood, according to video from local new channels.\n\nAt a press conference, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michael Moore said that 10 responding officers and seven civilians had non-life-threatening injuries from the explosion, which damaged homes and blasted out windows in the neighborhood.\n\nHe added it was unclear why there had been a \u201ctotal catastrophic failure of that containment vehicle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis vessel should have been able to safely dispose of that material,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cProtocols were followed and pursued, but something happened in that containment vehicle that should not have happened and we don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nMoore said officers were responding to a call about illegal fireworks at a private residence when they found boxes of commercial-grade fireworks stacked eight to 10 feet high (2.4-3 meters), and estimated to weigh up to 5,000 pounds (2,300 kilograms) stored on the patio.\n\nWhile removing the fireworks, the officers discovered additional, improvised explosives made of soda cans and simple fuses, Moore said.\n\nThose devices were scanned and transferred to the specially-designed containment truck and detonated around 6:40 pm.\n\nA resident at the house stashing the explosives, 27-year-old Arturo Cejas, was arrested and charged with possession of a destructive device.\n\nPolice are also looking to charge him with child endangerment after finding his 10-year-old brother on the same premises.\n\n\u201cWe understand that this explosive material was acquired out of state and transported here for the purposes of reselling it to community members and neighbors for use during this Fourth of July holiday,\u201d Moore said.\n\nThe drought-plagued city of Los Angeles has launched a fireworks buyback program ahead of the holiday, hoping to stop the illegal sale and use of the banned explosives. Last year, the LAPD said it seized more than four tons of fireworks.",

Renewed lockdowns and rising costs have already weakened momentum in Asia\u2019s factory activities in June.\n\nIn the United States, crude stockpiles fell last week for the sixth straight week in response to rising demand, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.\n\nA drop in crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, to the lowest since March 2020 also underpinned the U.S. benchmark, squeezing its discount to Brent to the narrowest since September 2020 on Wednesday.\n\nBrent was seen averaging $67.48 a barrel this year and WTI $64.54, both up from forecasts in May, a June Reuters poll showed.",

          "title": "Xi Jinping Warns Against Foreign Bullying as China Marks Party Centenary",
          "text": "China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on Thursday warned that foreign forces attempting to bully the nation will \u201cget their heads bashed\u201d, and hailed a \u201cnew world\u201d created by its people as the ruling Communist Party marked the centenary of its founding.\n\nIn an hour-long address from Tiananmen Square, Xi pledged to build up China\u2019s military, committed to the \u201creunification\u201d of Taiwan and said social stability would be ensured in Hong Kong while protecting China\u2019s security and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cThe people of China are not only good at destroying the old world, they have also created a new world,\u201d said Xi, China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, the founder of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cOnly socialism can save China.\u201d\n\nXi and the party are riding high as China recovers briskly from the COVID-19 outbreak and takes a more assertive stance on the global stage.\n\nBut Beijing faces external criticism over its clampdown in Hong Kong and treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, and is dealing with a worsening demographic outlook that imperils long-term economic growth.\n\nA survey of 17 advanced economies released on Wednesday by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center showed that views about China have remained broadly negative and confidence in Xi near historic lows.\n\nOn Thursday, Xi said that the people of China would never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or subjugate them.\n\n\u201cAnyone who dares try to do that will have their heads bashed bloody against the Great Wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people,\u201d he said, sparking applause from an invited audience of 70,000 gathered in the massive square in central Beijing. The phrase became the top trending topic on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo on Thursday morning.\n\nTang Renwu, a professor of public management at Beijing Normal University, said the tough talk was in response to U.S. and western efforts to \u201ccontain\u201d and \u201csuppress\u201d China.\n\n\u201cXi\u2019s stronger-than-usual response would have the effect of invoking even more patriotic and nationalistic sentiment among the Chinese people,\u201d Tang said.\n\nChina, whose rapid military modernisation has fuelled growing worry among its neighbours and in the West, will build up its armed forces to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development, elevating them to world-class standards, Xi said.\n\n\u201cWe must accelerate the modernisation of national defense and the armed forces,\u201d said Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the country\u2019s armed forces.\n\nResolving the Taiwan question and realising China\u2019s complete \u201creunification\u201d is an \u201cunswerving historical task\u201d of the party, Xi said.\n\n\u201cAll sons and daughters of China, including compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, must work together and move forward in solidarity, resolutely smashing any \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 plots,\u201d he said.\n\nChina, which considers democratically-ruled Taiwan its own, has stepped up efforts to assert its sovereignty claims, including sending fighter jets and bombers close to the island.\n\nRegarding Hong Kong and Macau, Xi said China will \u201cstay true to the letter and spirit of the principle of \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019,\u201d under which the two are promised a high degree of autonomy.\n\nHowever, a sweeping national security law imposed on Hong Kong a year ago has seen Beijing drastically tighten its grip on the once freewheeling financial hub. The traditional July 1 protests marking the anniversary of the city\u2019s 1997 handover to Chinese rule were thwarted as police denied permission for a rally, citing coronavirus restrictions.\n\nThursday\u2019s celebrations began with a flyby of fighter jets and helicopters observed by the nation\u2019s leaders, seated at the southern ramparts of the Forbidden City. A 3,000-strong chorus sang seven socialist songs during the event.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party initially recruited peasants and workers but has evolved to embrace markets and entrepreneurship under \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d while retaining a Leninist model of authoritarianism.\n\nParty ranks swelled by 2.43 million in 2020, the largest annual gain since Xi became president in 2013, to 95.15 million members now, data released on Wednesday showed.\n\nXi said the \u201cinterests and destiny of all people in China\u201d were tied to the party leadership and any attempt to turn the people against the party was bound to fail.\n\n\u201cThe more than more than 1.4 billion Chinese people will never allow such a scenario to come to pass,\u201d he said.\n\nA 60-year-old teacher surnamed Wang who was photographing the overflying jets from a park on Thursday said he has much admiration for the party.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s chairman Mao, or Deng Xiaoping, or today\u2019s leaders, it\u2019s not easy for them \u2013 if you brought foreign leaders here and show how they manage 1.4 billion people, making sure they all have food to eat and a good life, it\u2019s truly not easy.\u201d\n\nXi closed his speech by leading two crowd-rousing cheers: \u201clong live the CCP that is great, glorious and right\u201d, and \u201clong live the people who are great, glorious and heroic\u201d.",
