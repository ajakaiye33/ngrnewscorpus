They should know that they don\u2019t have the monopoly of thuggery. It will be disastrous if we meet them on their turf.\n\n\u201cWe have reported the case to the Police Command in Ikeja and the DSS in Shangisha. To be fore warned is to be fore armed.\n\n\u201cThey should teach their followers to be more tolerant,\u2019\u2019 Lagos PDP Chairman, Adedeji Doherty, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday, in Lagos.\n\nHe said that disturbing acts of destruction of banners, posters and other materials necessary for advertising aspirants for the forthcoming council elections in the state could cause violence.\n\nDoherty said that reports reaching his office showed that the destructions of PDP posters were happening all over the state.\n\nThe PDP chairman urged APC leaders to caution their supporters to stop such practices.\n\nHe called on Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos APC State Chairman, Alhaji Babatunde Balogun, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, the Department of State Security and other security agencies to urgently look into the trend.\n\nAccording to Doherty, it is an irony to have banners and posters of aspirants of the APC up and standing, while those of aspirants of the opposition are either removed, defaced, damaged, or destroyed.\n\nThe PDP chairman urged PDP supporters to remain peaceful, even in the face of provocations, and called on all concerned persons and security agencies to urgently nip these acts in the bud before law and order break down.\n\nReacting to the allegations, APC\u2019s Publicity Secretary, Seye Oladejo, advised the PDP to look inward to fish out culprits behind the alleged destruction of its banners and posters.\n\n\u201cI will advise him (Doherty) to look inwards. There\u2019s absolutely no need to dissipate energy on this.\n\n\u201cThis is not my personal opinion though; our political history in Lagos State since the advent of this democratic dispensation is explicitly clear about that.\n\n\u201cThe other time their spokesperson humbly admitted that they stood no chance in the coming elections; now they talk about torn posters.

          "text": "By Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nPRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday called on West African leaders to mount pressure on the military leadership in Mali to ensure that the transition process in the country was not aborted.\n\nPresident Buhari made the call in a statement he delivered at the 59th Ordinary session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS on Saturday in Accra, Ghana\n\nThe President, who spoke on the situation in Mali, which was recently suspended from the regional bloc due to a military coup said, \u201dAt this Summit today, we are expected to review a number of important reports dealing with various issues of concerns to our organisation and people.\n\n\u201dIn doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions which will positively impact our citizens.\n\n\u201dSome of those decisions, necessarily will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201dWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of Government they want.\n\n\u201dPressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is half-way to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201dA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is unfortunately under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe President according to the statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as being \u201dclearly under siege.\u201d\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, the President cautioned them not to perpetuate acts that would facilitate the destabilization and destruction of Mali.\n\n\u201dI urge our organization to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute Mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly, for his untiring efforts thus far. I encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Libya, President Buhari faulted the recent United Nations Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya, without first ensuring that they are disarmed and non-collaboration with regional stakeholders.\n\n\u201dOn the security situation in the region, our organisation must note with serious concern, the recent decision by the United Nations and its Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya, without first, ensuring that they are disarmed and that neighbouring countries and the Sub-regions were engaged, to put in place modalities for containing or managing the movement of these fighters.\n\n\u201dWhile this action was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders on this critical decision, has now created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region, which could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region,\u201d he said.\n\nReiterating that these regions face the clear possibility of instability with the invasion of the foreign fighters that are fully armed, the President said:\n\n\u201dIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the Nigerian leader at the Summit also addressed other pertinent issues of concern in the organisation, including the ongoing institutional reforms in ECOWAS.\n\nDeclaring Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reforms process, the President said he was looking forward to an ECOWAS that is \u201dfit for purpose\u201d, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nHe commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\n\u201dWe have clearly realised that operating a bloated administration with the current global economic collapse occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic will be to the detriment of services to our people which is not sustainable.\n\n\u201dThis positive action will certainly enable our organisation move on and deliver services to the satisfaction of our Community citizens.\n\n\u201dLet me remind us that this is only the beginning as the responsibility of streamlining operational costs as well as the modalities for the appointment of Statutory positions of the incoming management are still outstanding.\n\n\u201dIt is my view that paying attention to existing regulations that guide the appointment of statutory appointees will further guarantee the efficiency and sustainability of the organization,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his capacity as the ECOWAS champion on the fight against Covid-19, President Buhari also drew attention to the need for more citizens in the region to be vaccinated, stressing the need for adherence to other non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nHe said the West African region was in the grip of a third wave, warning against complacency in national and regional initiatives to address the pandemic.\n\n\u201dThe region has experienced two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the second wave being more prevalent with higher death rates.\n\n\u201dAlthough we appear to have come out of the second wave, there is a very strong possibility that we may experience a third wave similar to what is going on in other parts of the world, particularly as vaccination levels are still very low.\n\n\u201dIt is therefore critical to maintain vigilance and deploy smart non-pharmaceutical public health measures as necessary.\n\n\u201dWe must not relent; our Ministers of Health in collaboration with WAHO should intensify their regular Coordinating Committee meetings to maintain the unified regional approach in the fight against Covid-19.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the noble objectives of the Organisation, saying:\n\n\u201dI encourage us to take bolder steps towards ensuring that the Organisation fulfils the aspirations of its founding fathers, which include a truly integrated sub-region, economically, politically, socio-culturally united and secured to permit its sustainable development and growth.\u201d",

The way the examination was arranged coupled with the invigilating was ok.\n\n\u201cBut there was a slight computer problem when the power was shut down and they\u2019ve to start the generating set to put on the power. So this delayed the progress of the examination.\u201d\n\nAlso at the Royal Midland CBT centre, Anita Haruna, said the examination went smoothly but only experienced delay when the power was shut down.\n\nHaruna disclosed that she finished her examination successfully but only started late while praying that she comes out high flying.\n\nHowever, one of the Supervisor for Royal Midland CBT centre, Mrs Queen Obepa, lamented that the examination didn\u2019t commence as scheduled but every technical hitch was however fixed.\n\nObepa disclosed that not all the candidates were able to start at the same time because of the technical hitches saying that twenty-seven candidates were delayed in writing as they did not start on time.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t start on time as the generator had issues and we\u2019ve resolved it. We were here yesterday and everything worked well but on getting here today, we experienced this problem.\n\n\u201cThe generator shut down and it took time to bring it back so we wasted like one hour to fix it.\n\n\u201cThis centre has 245 candidates for the morning session and 245 for the afternoon session.\n\n\u201cWe could not capture one person so he was asked to go back and contact JAMB and we also have somebody that came in late and she wasn\u2019t able to write the examinations.\u201d\n\nAt the Global Distance Learning Centre in FCT, candidates commendeJAMB for the quick response in attending to issues during the examination.\n\nAisha Mouhktar, a candidate at the centre, told NAN that the examination went smoothly without any problems.\n\nMouhktar said, \u201cWe were given instructions on how to start. The examination was good as expected as there were no technical issues.\n\n\u201cAt this centre only a candidate that could not submit his questions and prompt action was immediately taken to help him out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, speaking with newsmen, JAMB High Power Opinion Leaders, Mr Abdulrahman Balogun, revealed that some centres he monitored had technical issues while some were free from technical issues.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome are having technical issues like the Junior Secondary School in Jikwoyi . For almost one and half hours, the system packed up so they\u2019ve to quickly bring in some of their technical staff to ensure it.\n\n\u201cAs at the time I left the place at 9:18 am, they are still working on it which means they haven\u2019t started as they said they want them to start at the same time.\n\n\u201cIf not they would have allowed those that their systems are working to start but coming to Global Distance Learning the story is different.

          "title": "Charly Boy @ 71 Injustice in Nigeria stinks",
          "text": "By Oscar Nwogu\n\nCharles Chukwuemeka Oputa popularly known as Charly Boy is an enigma of some sort. As maverick as he is, he cannot stop pulling stunts here and there. On June 19, 2020, the ever-bubbly punk king celebrated his 70th birthday with little or no fanfare owing largely to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne year after, the general feeling is that Charly Boy would mark his 71st birthday today, Saturday June 19. But the weird one has pulled his stunt again, defying all logic, as he vowed to mark another 70th birthday. According to him, he has commenced his backward aging process and would be celebrating his 69th birthday next year, as against marking 72.\n\nAsked why he prefers to count his age backward rather than upward, the musician, producer and activist says there is nothing to celebrate going forward. \u201cThe government in power has not done anything to put smiles on the faces of Nigerians. It is confusion, agitation, rape, killings, maiming, stagnation, nepotism, tribalism and clownishness everywhere. There is no hope for the common man. Since there is nothing to celebrate, I would rather remark my 70th birthday this year. Next year, I will mark 69, a process of aging backwards,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, Charly Boy will today celebrate his aging backward birthday with the launch of his EP titled, Odudubariba, which simply means a spiritual warrior. \u201cYes, it\u2019s again my second 70th birthday; next year, I will be 69, and henceforth will continue my backward aging. With the mood of the country and its people, we will keep the celebration simple and low-keyed. I am doing this for my fans and myself. What we are going through in Nigeria today is decades of inaction, docility and my thief better pass your thief mentality. We have been living on corruption money since the \u201860s.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to live as one if we can\u2019t come to the table to resolve our differences. The injustice in Nigeria stinks, that\u2019s why many regions want to go their separate ways. From day one, the foundation of this country was faulty, a scam, and the constitution, fraudulent. We can\u2019t make progress with a faulty foundation. We have no choice but to reap what we have sowed over the years. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s the reality of our time,\u201d he said.\n\nAre we expecting fireworks, protests and all sort of razzmatazz from Charly Boy as he counts his age backward? His response: \u201cThe mood in the country doesn\u2019t call for any fireworks, say who die? It\u2019s time for deep, meaningful reflection about our dangerous predicament. I\u2019m not insensitive to the pain my people are passing through. I have retired from active street protest, which has not yielded much with the bunch of people in government today. Two years ago, I retired from active street protest after giving it my all for 45 years. I am not a professional protester. I have reviewed my strategy and I am deploying my frustrations through my music, hence my coming back to one of the powerful tools of resistance: music.\u201d\n\nThe Charly Boy brand means different things to different people. His alternative lifestyle and political views have brought in its wake a mix of bad admirers and haters. On the choice of his outrageous brand, the controversial musician says, \u201cI built this youthful brand to shock and awe ignorant, mongoparkish, analogue, outdated, stupid and idiotic Nigerians out of their potopoto mindset.\u201d\n\nAs president of the Performing Musicians Employers Association of Nigeria (PMAN) many years ago, Charly Boy did not only restore respect and dignity of the Nigerian musicians, he also fought piracy and ensured that artistes had a strong voice in the affairs of the industry. \u201cAs PMAN president, I fought for more respect for the Nigerian artiste, I fought for more money, fought for their intellectual property rights. Today, the Nigerian music and musicians are reaping the fruits of our struggles back in the day.\u201d\n\nThe Area Fada, as he is popularly called, believes that the Nigerian youths need reawakening of their mindset. \u201cIt\u2019s either they are vexed enough to understand what is about to happen or happening to them or they are too scared and rigid to act. It is the docility of the youths that has contributed to my decision to stay on my own and use music, which is a stronger tool, to fight for the people.\n\n\u201cI still believe that the salvation of this country lies in the hands of its exceptional youths. I still can\u2019t see how these ancestors from the 18th century can defeat the millennial of the 21st century. This oppressive government can\u2019t operate in perpetuity. It has an expiration date. But for sure, there will be consequences for our docility over the years. Before it gets better, it will get worse. How do we reason with barbarians and animals in human skin? There is a demonic wind blowing across the country now. Prayers alone can never solve this, we must resolve to strategically push back or accept our fate as slaves,\u201d he averred.\n\nHowever, the veteran musician believes that all hope is not lost for Nigeria. \u201cThere is hope for the country,\u201d he enthused, \u201cit is still the exceptional few, Nigerian youths, that will remedy this country when the chips are down.\u201d\n\nAny regrets? Charly Boy retorted: \u201cRegrets? No. Life is a journey of twists and turns. I have lived a charming life, 90 per cent of the time on my own terms and rules. I was the underdog no one gave a chance. I have lived several lives in one and I am not your regular everyday Nigerian, I am a limited edition. I have no damn regrets. My life is better than most Hollywood fiction. I will forever be my authentic self. I\u2019ll forever keep pushing my dreams with consistency, tenacity, sagacity, audacity and tremendous focus.\u201d",

          "title": "We\u2019re finished: 5 dead, scores injured, 25 vehicles razed in Lagos gas explosion",
          "text": "By Omodele Adigun, Lawrence Enyoghasu And Lukman Olabiyi\n\nIt was a tragedy that nobody saw coming. But by the time it was over, it left five people dead, scores injured, some of them critically, 25 cars burnt and one building structure in complete ruins.\n\nThere is, perhaps, no better way to describe the ruins and destruction caused by the liquefied petroleum tanker explosion that shook Mobolaji Johnson Way, Ikeja, Lagos, to its foundation on Thursday night, precisely at about 11p.m. Said to have been caused by a leaking valve of a moving tanker, it ignited a huge fireball that practically licked up every combustible item on its path. Affected mostly are business owners and employees at Ogun State Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Plaza, Ikeja.\n\nA vulcanizer who lost two cars given to him to sell to the inferno, became the object of pity of sympathizers when he lamented that he wa finished as he didn\u2019t know what to do or to tell the owners.\n\nMany hours later, the smoldering scene still points to a tragedy of immense proportion. Initial report claimed that 13 people, nine males, four females, sustained various degrees of burns in the incident, which occurred in front of the popular Sheraton Hotel, Ikeja. The Acting Zonal Coordinator, South West Zonal Office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, informed newsmen that three bodies were initially recovered from the scene of the explosion. But the number later increased to five.\n\nThe affected victims are being attended to at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), he added. \u201cOnly four of the critically injured were transferred to Burn Centre, General Hospital Gbagada at about 0230hours today. The yet-to-be-identified bodies were recovered from the generator house of OPIC Plaza and the restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cSearch-and-rescue is still ongoing at the collapsed buildings.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the LPG tanker exploded at about 10.32 hours. The resulting fire travelled with the wind to the premises of Ogun State Property Investment Company (OPIC) Plaza, besides Sheraton Hotel and housing different commercial outfits, including the Chinese Restaurant.\n\nProviding an update on the incident, he said: \u201cThe fire was put out at about 0030 hours following concerted efforts by five fire trucks from Lagos State Fire Service and two from LASEMA Response Unit. Preliminary assessment on vehicles damaged indicated that about 25 were burnt. Comprehensive post-disaster assessment on the extent of general damages would be done later. The Commissioner of Police, Lagos Command, Hakeem Odumosu was at hand and took charge of crowd control and normalised the situation for a successful operation. NEMA, LASTMA, State Fire Service, FRSC and NSCDC were at the scene.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the inferno was reported to have led to the quick evacuation of all guests at Sheraton Hotel. It later led to a heavy traffic congestion that grounded movements on all entrances/exits routes to Ikeja and trapped motorists for several hours. Some of the affected motorists, who made short videos of the incident, blamed the slow response by emergency services for the escalation of the inferno. The videos shared on social platforms showed aggrieved onlookers lamenting how long it took rescuers \u2013 some claimed it was more than 30 minutes \u2013 to get to the scene of the fire incident.\n\nThe Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), in a short message, said all emergency workers were at the scene working to contain the situation. The Director General (DG), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said that the information gathered at the scene revealed that the fire started as a result of explosion while the gas tanker was moving inward Ikeja.\n\nVictims and eyewitness accounts\n\nOscar Odion, a dispatch rider with Sandra Logistics and an eyewitness of the ensuing horror, said that he was on his way back from the day\u2019s work when he saw the fire. Cries of agony rent the air as fire fighters battled hard against the enraging and spreading flame. Smokes and fire billowed from the bodies of people caught in the resultant melee. Some tried to escape only to get crushed by escaping motorists.\n\nHis account: \u201cIt happened around 11 pm yesterday while I was on my way home. I was riding with a friend when we saw the fire. We saw people struggling to escape. A child lay abandoned on the floor. I watched as the building collapsed. We tried to curtail the spread of the fire before fire service people arrived. A guy tried to rescue a victim trapped in the fire. Another guy saved from the fire got knocked down by a vehicle on motion. We mainly engaged ourselves in fetching water from the tap in the compound, because fire service men from the first fire service truck that arrived the scene claimed not to have water. As the fire spread we could not stand and do nothing.\u201d\n\nOluwaseun Olowaremi Peters, a driver with Oasis Supermarket, was not only an eyewitness but much more importantly a survivor of the inferno. When our reporter met him he was in a sober mood and busy quietly telling few people around him how he narrowly escaped death. Donning a pair of oversized black trousers and with his hands folded in praying position, to signify his gratitude to God, he said:\n\n\u201cI wanted to watch the football match. But on realizing that the bet9ja shop had closed, I went back to my car to rest my head and listen to the commentary of the game. But not long after I woke up from sleep to have my night prayer, because I had decided not to go home, I heard a big bang. It was like the sound of a thunder. Everywhere was covered with acrid smoke so much that I could not see. It was painful to the eyes. When I realized it was not raining, I quickly ran out.\n\n\u201cAs I was trying to escape, my trousers got caught up somewhere. I tore it and jumped outside as I saw the enraging fire coming towards me. I thank God that my car\u2019s door opened at once because if it had not, I would have been trapped in the fire. When I jumped from the fence, I landed inside a gas storage tank. All my body became cold up till my toenails. I was immobilized; I could not move. All the same I mustered strength and escaped.\u201d\n\nMuritala Mudasiru, a vulcanizer who lost two cars and two machines to the inferno, was being consoled by friends as he stood behind the yellow demarcating tape, furtively gazing into space.\n\n\u201cI was here till 10 pm before I left for home,\u201d he explained. \u201cI first got the call that a gas trailer had spoiled and released some gas.

          "title": "Student Dies in Crossfire as Troops Free Five Kebbi School Abductees",
          "text": "\u2022Bagudu visits school, promises all abductees will be rescued\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Ismail Adebayo in Birnin Kebbi\n\nOne of the students abducted by bandits who attacked the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, last Thursday night has died during a crossfire between the kidnappers and security agents.\n\nThe kidnappers, who stormed the school in large number, were armed with sophisticated weapons, abducted 30 students, and killed a policeman. A teacher, a vice-principal, the school\u2019s security officer, and the wife of a teacher, were also abducted.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State visited the affected school yesterday, where he met with the parents, and promised that all abducted students would be freed.\n\nThe shootout that claimed the life of the student happened yesterday morning when the fleeing kidnappers ran into men of the Joint Taskforce of Operation Hadarin Daji in the North-West Zone, at a roadblock, while heading out of Kebbi State.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Force Commander, Operation Hadari Daji, Air Commodore Abubakar Abdulkadir, as a result of the duel, the bandits were forced to abandon five students and a teacher.\n\nSadly, one of the students, who was unidentified, died in the crossfire. No further detail was given on how the death occurred.\n\nAbdulkadir said: \u201cIn the early hours of this morning, we came across the kidnappers. They came to our blocking point, and we engaged them. At that point, they abandoned five of the students and one of the teachers. Unfortunately, I think we lost one of the students.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Army in a statement yesterday confirmed the death of the student but attributed the death to \u201cexhaustion during a rescue operation as troops of Operation Hadarin Daji engaged kidnappers in a fire-fight, culminating in the rescue of five students and two teachers of Federal Government College, Yauri.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by the Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops had launched a manhunt for the kidnappers and bandits, following the abduction of the students.\n\n\u201cThe rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of today (yesterday) 18 June 2021 after trailing the kidnappers from Yauri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the kidnappers who had split into two groups fled, with one group conveying the abducted children, while the second group conveyed rustled cattle,\u201d it said.\n\nThe update on the abduction said the land troops in conjunction with elements of the Nigerian Air Force, who provided close air support during the rescue mission, intercepted the two groups at about 2.30 am.\n\nIt said the troops also recovered 800 cattle rustled by the bandits and maintained that the gallant troops were still on the heels of the kidnappers to rescue the remaining abductees still in captivity.\n\n\u201cThe rescued teachers and students will be handed over to the Kebbi State Government. The Nigerian Army appreciates the cooperation so far from good-spirited citizens and wishes to solicit more. \u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Maj Gen Faruk Yahaya has directed the commander to spare no effort until all the abducted persons are safely rescued and reunited with their loved ones,\u201d it said.\n\nThe rescued students and teachers are currently receiving medical treatment at the Yauri General Hospital.\n\nBagudu Promises Freedom for Abducted Students\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bagudu yesterday met with parents of abducted Yauri students at the school premises, assuring them that they would be rescued soon.\n\nHe assured the parents that the state government, relevant security agencies, and the presidency were working together to rescue the student from the bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will do anything to bring the children back. We have already engaged the necessary security agencies and they are working to rescue them. All we need to do we have done. What we need from you are your prayers and support.\u201d\n\nBagudu said the state government was alerted two weeks ago that the bandits were sighted around the school area, adding: \u201cWe planned to move them but the school authorities said the students have two weeks left to write their final exams. For this, the commissioner of police was gracious enough to dispatch 22 men and officers from the counter-terrorism unit to the school but they were overpowered because the bandits came in hundreds.\u201d\n\n\u2018How Bandits Took Our Children Away\u2019\n\nWorried parents of the abducted Yauri students yesterday narrated to Governor Bagudu how the bandits came in hundreds, overran the security at the school, and went away with many students.\n\nA parent and one of the cooks engaged for the security personnel deployed to the school, Mrs. Aliheri Gabonchok said she was at the kitchen when the bandits stormed the premises and started shooting sporadically.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen they came, I rushed into hiding with some of the students I could gather. I told them to lie down till the gunshot subsided. I came out when they had left, only to hear from other staff, who also escaped, that they went away with some students, school staff, and even my husband.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Ainan Muhammed, said the bandits who invaded the school were about 400.\n\nAnother parent, Aliyu Wushishi said his five children were among those abducted by the bandits and appealed to the governor to do whatever he could do to rescue the students from the bandits.\n\nThe Emir of Yauri, Dr. Sayyanu Abdullahi charged the government to have the political will to deal with banditry.\n\nThe emir also said people in the various communities should see it as their duty to expose those serving as informants to bandits in their communities.\n\nThe royal father gave the charge when governor Badugu visited his palace in Yauri after meeting with some parents of the abducted students.\n\nVehicle Used for Abduction\n\nMeanwhile, the police command in Kebbi State yesterday explained that one of the vehicles used for the kidnaping belongs to a high court judge in the state.\n\nNafi\u2019u Abubakar, the Kebbi police spokesman, said the van was hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road.\n\nAbubakar said the police are yet to determine the number of students kidnapped from the school located in Ngaski LGA of the state.\n\nHe said the reports making the rounds that 50 students were kidnapped from the school were false.\n\nThe Kebbi police spokesman said: \u201cThe attention of the police has been drawn to reports made by some media stations that a police vehicle was used in kidnapping about 50 students of the FGC. A White Hilux Van with registration No. kBSJ 29 belonging to a High Court judge with the inscription of Kebbi State Judiciary, hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road was the one used in the kidnapping and not a police vehicle as stated by some media stations.\n\n\u201cThe command wishes to make it clear and set the records straight that yet to be ascertained number of students are still missing as rescue operation is still ongoing.\u201d\n\nThough the Kebbi State Government and the school\u2019s authorities are yet to release the official number of students and staff abducted in the school, unofficial sources said, in all, 30 students and four officials were kidnapped.\n\n\u201c25 students and two officials of the school are still with the kidnappers,\u201d said a source close to the school.\n\nYauri Lawmaker Laments\n\nThe lawmaker representing the Igaski/Shanga/Yauri in Kebbi State at the House of Representatives, Yusuf Sununu, has lamented attacks by bandits in Kebbi State.\n\nSununu warned that the growing insecurity in Kebbi State was a major threat to food security in the country.\n\nSununu said the pervading insecurity in the country was becoming worrisome, saying, \u201cgone are the days when Kebbi used to be the most peaceful in the country.\n\n\u201cA week ago, we had another calamity when bandits \u2013 according to eyewitnesses \u2013 numbering about 250 to 300, each with an AK-47 rifle and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency. They had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, going from house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles, and cattle. That led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons to the headquarters of the emirate in the town of Yauri.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back, and in the early hours of today, they repeated what they had done earlier, and they came into the constituency, somehow around 10:30 am or thereabout. They were able to gain access after strong fights with some security guards and policemen guarding the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, and they made their way into the school.\n\n\u201cThis is a cause for concern and as representative of the people, I had to come here and make a call on the Federal Government to look at Yauri\u2019s position with its neighbouring Niger State. It has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is the bank of River Niger. We fear that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now, we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security. I have got in touch with security agencies. We had discussions and it has been confirmed to me that military aircraft are in surveillance in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have to make it clear that Kebbi State and indeed Yauri holds a unique position in the food security of this country. Over 90 per cent of the land of Yauri is for rice farming. But as of today, no farmer can comfortably go back to his farm and farm and come back to sleep with his eyes closed.\n\n\u201cWe are right now facing an influx of some people into Yauri with a higher rate of internally displaced persons. Accommodation, feeding, and other necessary logistics are being affected. The worst part of it is that a nation can only develop when it is sound educationally.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Boko Haram is almost becoming a reality because parents cannot feel free to send their wards to school for fear of being kidnapped. As it is now, a lot of primary schools in the emirate in Yauri town are being occupied by IDPs. This tends to deter the progress so far achieved by the Kebbi State Government in terms of agriculture and in terms of promoting access to education.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

As such, we urge you to offer top-of-the-range and affordable service to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs we seek to make broadband widely available and affordable, we urge MTN to continue to support our efforts by expanding high quality connectivity to Nigerians in unserved and underserved areas.\u201d\n\nThe President also called on the group to support the implementation of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cI recently unveiled and launched the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian telecommunications sector. I call on MTN to support the implementation of this policy and train and engage more Nigerians in your company.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we would like you to continue to support our efforts by improving the quality of service and enabling a downward price review of the cost of data and other services, in view of your large market in Nigeria. We also urge you to step up your Corporate Social Responsibility programmes and support Research and Development that will enhance your services in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe assured his visitors that his administration was doing everything possible to make Nigeria investor-friendly by addressing identified challenges:\n\n\u201cWe are implementing a number of policies and programmes to ensure that institutions like MTN have a conducive environment for doing business in Nigeria. Our massive jump in the Global Ease of Doing Business Ranking is proof that our efforts are yielding positive results.\n\n\u201cWe have identified and addressed the key challenges that affected the growth of the digital economy sector. One of such challenges was the high Right of Way costs and another was the vandalism of critical national infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note that the Right of Way charges have now been pegged at a maximum of N145/linear metre and I have given directives for the protection of critical national infrastructure and this has addressed the issue of vandalism of such infrastructure. Service providers should always appreciate the effort of government and not undermine it.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari expressed his delight that the Information and communications technology sector was doing very well despite the global economic downturn.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe information and communications technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the report by the National Bureau of Statistics. The sector\u2019s 14.70% double digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest growing sector of Q4 2020, which had a growth rate of 3.42%. This is truly commendable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Osinbajo, delivered his message on Thursday when he received members of the board of telecoms giant, MTN, led by the company\u2019s Group President and CEO, Mr Ralph Mupita, on a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa.\n\nHe stated that it was critical for corporate organisations to show commitment to improving services and to build confidence in the people.\n\nWhile noting that there have been hiccups in the relationship, the VP commended MTN for its contribution to the country, adding that the company is clearly an important part of Nigeria\u2019s story.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cCorporate organisations should be more accountable in their services, in the ownership structure, and also in paying attention to the needs of the people. Companies that ensure this will experience progress, as this is the right direction to go. Going forward, most corporates will find that attaching greater importance to the people is the way to go.\n\n\u201cFor telecommunication firms like MTN, financial inclusion is crucial, so is broadband connection in deepening access and will help to connect hard-to-reach places, and to retail social welfare and services. The company\u2019s investment was crucial when Nigeria needed to show that not only is there a large population in the country, but that it is a large market. The market was severely underestimated for a long time. So, MTN is an important part of our story, we regard MTN as an important partner.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Mupita said that they want to deepen structure of ownership in Nigeria.\n\nWhile disclosing that the company wants to have the largest retail-based shareholding in Nigeria, Mupita said they plan to sell another 14 per cent to Nigerian individuals and institutions.\n\nHe added that MTN as a corporate citizen is responsible in all the countries where it is represented.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He succeeded Ban Ki-moon in January 2017 as the ninth secretary-general.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after taking the oath of office for a second term, Guterres said he had extended an offer to Mohammed to continue in office.\n\n\u201cAfter being elected, I have the pleasure to invite the deputy secretary-general to remain in my second mandate and I hope she will accept,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nMohammed, who was standing behind Guterres at the press briefing, responded with the comment: \u201cabsolute honour\u201d.\n\nShe had also served as the special adviser to Ban Ki-moon on post-2015 development planning, which focused on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals.\n\nMohammed is a diplomat and politician who is serving as the fifth Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\nPreviously, she was Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Environment from 2015 to 2016 and was a key player in the Post-2015 Development Agenda process.\n\nMohammed was born in Liverpool, UK to a Fulani Nigerian veterinarian-officer and a British nurse.

Her mandate included designing a Virtual Poverty Fund with innovative approaches to poverty reduction, budget coordination and monitoring, as well as providing advice on pertinent issues regarding poverty, public sector reform and sustainable development.\n\nMohammed later became the Founder and CEO of the Center for Development Policy Solutions and as an Adjunct Professor for the Master\u2019s in Development Practice program at Columbia University.\n\nDuring that time, she served on numerous international advisory boards and panels, including the UN Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Independent Expert Advisory Group on the Data Revolution for Sustainable Development.

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe controversy surrounding the power of the President to extend the tenure of any retiring Inspector General of Police, pending the completion of the process of appointing a successor, was yesterday laid to rest with the affirmation of the President\u2019s power to do so by the ruling of a federal high court in Abuja.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on February 4 extended the tenure of Mohammed Adamu as Inspector-General of Police by three months after he clocked the mandatory 35 years in service on February 1.\n\nHowever, a legal practitioner, Maxwell Opara, dragged the president and IGP to court, arguing that by virtue of section 215 of the Nigerian Constitution and section 7 of the Nigeria Police Act, 2020, Adamu cannot continue to function as the IGP, having completed 35 years in service.\n\nIn his defence, the IGP told the federal high court that the new Nigeria Police Act gave him a four-year tenure, which would only lapse in either 2023 or 2024.\n\nSupporting Adamu\u2019s position, President Buhari and the attorney-general of the federation, Abubakar Malami \u2013 who are the second and third defendants in the matter \u2013 told the court through their lawyer that the law permits the IGP to remain in office until either 2023 or 2024.\n\nIn his judgment yesterday, Ahmed Mohammed, the presiding judge, held that since the constitution and the police act empower the president to appoint an IGP, by implication, he could extend the tenure of a retiring IGP before concluding the required consultation with the police council and other processes required for the appointment of a substantive replacement.\n\nThe judge also observed that the constitution and the police act were silent on the issue of whether or not the president could extend the tenure of a retired IGP.\n\nSome senior advocates of Nigeria (SANs) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had assailed Buhari for extending Adamu\u2019s tenure.\n\nThey declared his action as violating the 1999 Constitution as (amended) and the Police Act (2020).\n\nMinister of Police Affairs, Mr. Mohammad Dingyadi, told State House reporters in Abuja that Adamu\u2019s tenure elongation would allow for proper screening of all qualified senior police officers before the eventual choice of a new IG.\n\nHe said then: \u201cMr. President has decided that the present IG, Mohammed Adamu, will continue to serve as the IG for the next three months to allow for a robust and efficient process of appointing a new IG.\n\n\u201cThis is not unconnected to the desire of Mr. President to not only have a smooth handover but to also ensure that the right officer is appointed into that position. Mr. President is extending by three months to allow him to get into the process of allowing a new one.\u201d\n\nAdamu was eventually retired on April 6, when the current IGP, Usman Alkali was named by the President as the acting IGP.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges military to ramp up fight against insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday assured residents of Borno State of the federal government\u2019s readiness to fight terrorism to the end, telling the military not to give criminals a breathing space to undermine Nigeria\u2019s interests.\n\nThe president, during a visit to Borno State, commended troops for their loyalty and selfless service to Nigeria and urged them not to relent in their efforts to end the insurgency in the North-east.\n\nHe promised support for the families of fallen security personnel, saying he would ensure all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) return to their homes.\n\nHe also commended the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, for his resilience and relentless efforts in rebuilding the state.\n\nBuhari, during the visit to appraise the security situation in the state and to inaugurate some development projects attributed the recent successes recorded by the military against the insurgents and terrorists at Dikwa, Damboa and Gwoza to careful planning, infusion of new equipment and other war materials as well as quality military leadership.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged the enormity of the task ahead of the military.\n\n\u201cThe attacks launched by cowardly terrorists against military and civilian targets last month and in previous months were a pointer to us that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to this region is not yet over,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will not rest until all the millions of Internally Displaced Persons are able to return and resettle in their homes and rebuild their shattered lives.\u201d\n\nHe expressed the hope that the service chiefs would bring to bear on the war, their experience as commanders in theatre at various times.\n\nThe president said: \u201cAll of them are, therefore, personally familiar with the challenge of insurgency. I fully expect them to bring this wealth of personal experience to bear as we move to end this scourge once and for all.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these successes owe a lot to the role played by volunteers of the Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes. These good people include women, who are making huge sacrifices and patriotic contributions to our peace-restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nHe stated that many servicemen and women, as well as volunteers, had been killed in the fight to rid communities and the country of terrorism and insurgency and thanked all those involved for their gallantry and sacrifices.\n\nBuhari assured their loved ones that their sacrifices will not be in vain: \u201cI must also acknowledge the very important role and the sacrifices made by parents, guardians and other loved ones amongst the people of Borno State, the North-east region and the country as a whole, who support their sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in going to battlefields to defend Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and peace. I thank and commend them for their resilience and assure them success is in sight.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a mark of appreciation for the sacrifices made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers that the Nigerian Army was authorised to enlist hundreds of them into the Army.\n\nHe urged the people to sustain the cooperation with the military and the other security services.\n\n\u201cBoth must see each other as being on one side in order for us to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said the late President Idris Deby of Chad played a major role in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region and urged his successors to work hard in restoring democracy to the country and support the processes of bringing peace to the region.\n\nHe said the recent appointment of Ambassador Babagana Kingibe as special envoy to Chad and the Lake Chad Basin was intended to accelerate the restoration of democratic stability in the Chad Republic and enhance cooperation among all the countries of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHe assured the people that the federal government had taken decisive measures to safeguard IDPs and refugees who recently returned from Cameroon and the Niger Republic, adding that it was engaged in the task of rebuilding their communities after more than a decade of war and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was part of these measures that I gave approval for the federal government to build 10,000 resettlement homes in Borno State. Four thousand of these homes have already been completed. Furthermore, I approved for constant release of food intervention by the Nigerian Customs Service and the North East Development Commission in order to support displaced persons.\n\n\u201cI have directed these agencies to sustain and deepen this support. I also wish to specially commend His Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for his tireless efforts in directly supervising the distribution of food and economic empowerment to IDPs in all local government areas.\u201d He expressed the belief that the efforts at alleviating the suffering of displaced communities will hamper attempts by terrorists and insurgents to recruit fighters and spies from IDPs and other vulnerable populations through the use of paltry material incentives.\n\nOn electricity supply, Buhari said his administration would continue to make concerted efforts towards guaranteeing energy security to all, adding that Maiduguri could not, and would not be left out.\n\nHe said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had been directed to expedite the delivery of 50MW power plant in the state towards ensuring the restoration of electricity to Maiduguri and its environs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the light of the current improvement of security in the state, I have also issued directives for the immediate resumption of oil & gas exploration activities in the Lake Chad Basin. This is part of our overall effort to restore the state back to normalcy,\u201d the president explained.\n\nThe president applauded Zulum\u2019s efforts at providing facilities that directly impact the livelihood of people, particularly building educational and health institutions and constructing roads.\n\nHe also commended the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi, as well as all the other royal highnesses and Bulamas at all levels for their very exemplary leadership, patience, determination and wisdom during the past decade of ravage by insurgency and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that royal highnesses now operate from their domains was evidence that peace was being restored to the communities despite the challenges that remain to be overcome.\n\n\u201cThe elders, statesmen, Muslim and Christian community leaders all over this state and region also deserve our thanks and warm appreciation for their resilience, moral leadership and support for the federal and state governments during these trying times.\n\n\u201cI will never forget in my life that during my career as a politician, Borno State is where I got the highest percentage of votes, more than 90 per cent! The least I can do for you is to continue the relentless effort to fully restore peace to this state, the North-east region and the country as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the military and security agencies to continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nBuhari also interacted with some of the wounded soldiers assuring them that the government was committed to their recovery and welfare.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj. Gen. Felix Omoigui, assured troops of the president\u2019s confidence and commitment to their welfare, especially in ending the war.\n\nHe thanked the president for the visit to the troops, which he said would greatly boost the morale of all those fighting to keep the country in peace.\n\nGovernors of Borno and Yobe State, Zulum and Mai Bunu respectively; Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo; Chief of Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao, and National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), were also at the event.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum thanked the president for the relative peace in the state, buoyed by the heavy presence of military and security men who have been engaging the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed the gradual return of peace to Borno State and it is our sincere hope that insurgency will soon be brought to an end,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor appreciated the president for various developmental interventions, which include infrastructure, particularly the approval of 10,000 units of housing for IDPs of which 4,000 had been completed.\n\nPresident Thanks Nigerians for Opportunity to Serve\n\nIn the meantime, the president has expressed his gratitude to Nigerians for the opportunity given to him to serve them.\n\nHe said under his watch, efforts would be made to improve the livelihood of Nigerians, starting with adequate security.\n\nHe said at the palace of the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Garbai El-Kanemi, that he started his administrative career as a military officer in Borno State as a governor for seven months, under Gen. Murtala Muhammed, before he was appointed Minister of Petroleum by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was then a military head of state.\n\nHe added: \u201cMy commitment to serve Nigerians is a payback for the love shown to me. I started my political adventure in Maiduguri and I always look forward to coming here.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, El-Kanemi thanked the president for consistent response to the plight of the people in the state, saying that the security situation has improved.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A very senior citizen received a phone call from somebody that is not even under investigation. What the caller said to him on the phone is that; he is going to kill the EFCC chairman,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I am going to kill him. I am going to kill him\u2019. This is to tell you how bad it is. It is actually real.

He is after Bawa\u2019s life because of the investigation of Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed, the former Director of Finance and Administration in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), who oversaw the movement of money seized in Ikoyi and presently being investigated for looting,\u201d the source said.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how the anti-graft agency on March 11, 2021, obtained an interim forfeiture order from a Federal High Court in Abuja in respect of some properties allegedly belonging to Mungono but held in a proxy.\n\nIn her ruling, Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo granted an ex parte application for interim forfeiture of the assets and properties by the chairman of the EFCC, made on March 9.\n\nThe court ordered the publication of the interim forfeiture of the assets linked to a former Director of Finance in the Office of the NSA, Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed, and invited people \u201cwho may have interest in the assets and properties listed in the schedule to show cause, within 14 days of such publication, why a final order of forfeiture to the Federal Government of Nigeria of the said assets and properties should not be made.\u201d\n\nThe assets traced to the proxies and associates of the General include House on Plot 7, God's Own Estate, Road 1, Wamna District, Abuja; a fenced plot at No 1 Jubril Aminu Crescent, Katampe Extension, Abuja; plot at Kubwa Express, Directly opposite Abuja Model City Gate, Abuja; and a house on Block SD 22 House 2, Road 5, Kabusa Garden Estate, Abuja.\n\nOthers are No 15, 21 Crescent, 2nd Avenue, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja; No 3 Liverpool Close, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 52 Mainstreet, Sun City Estate, Abuja; and No 25 Osaka Street, Sun City Estate, Abuja.\n\nHowever, a security source had told SaharaReporters that Mohammed as the Director of Finance and Administration in the office of the NSA allegedly carried out many errands on behalf of Monguno.\n\n\u201cIt is not a secret that the NSA had a confidante in the Director of Finance, who used proxies on the instruction of his boss to acquire those properties. It was a very close-knitted deal in the sense that it would be difficult to trace any of these properties to them.\n\n\u201cBut with this move by the EFCC, it shows they might have some credible information at their disposal,\u201d the source had said.\n\nHe alleged that some top hierarchy in the Nigerian security architecture reported Monguno to President Buhari over the way he and Mohammed fleeced the coffers of the ONSA.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe NSA is very skilled in presenting the holier-than-thou attitude in the public. But in truth, I think the rot in the ONSA under him is worse than that of Sambo Dasuki (ex-NSA boss). Monies were spirited out recklessly, and this prompted the military hierarchy then as it was to effect some changes in the ONSA.\n\n\u201cThis saw to the transfer of several officers including the Director of Finance, Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed; the Special Assistant to the NSA, Colonel AA Ibrahim and the Director Legal Intercept, SS Shehu by the army hierarchy sometime in 2020 as a means to bring sanity into the ONSA which was excessively abused.\"\n\nAnother top security source further corroborated this position when he stated that the NSA and his former Director of Finance and Administration indeed committed some infractions that went unnoticed by the EFCC under Ibrahim Magu.\n\n\u201cI am aware that this was one of the things that worked against the confirmation of Ibrahim Magu as the EFCC Chairman because the Department of State Services got wind of the dealings and subsequently made sweeping arrest that were at some point toned down because of the issues it would generate in the public,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThis new development is therefore not surprising as most of us saw it coming with the way and manner the NSA and the director of finance and administration almost ran down the ONSA. I can assure you that those properties would be forfeited to the federal government as none of them would come forward to claim ownership.\n\n\u201cThe NSA was cut to size when he attempted to get approval for arms purchase from third party sources against the government directive of the country-to-country transaction in arms purchase. This deal was leaked by one of the former service chiefs who ensured that the president was briefed and the NSA was subsequently rebuked. Since then, there has been no love lost between them and the NSA, who uses any opportunity to launch scathing attacks on the tenure of the former service chiefs.\u201d\n\nAn EFCC source told SaharaReporters that preliminary investigations revealed that the properties were held in proxy for Monguno.\n\n\u201cThose properties were acquired by the former Director of Finance and Administration in the ONSA acting on instruction from Monguno. We were able to trace the deal and all those whose names were used on behalf of the NSA.\n\n\u201cThere is every likelihood that the court would eventually grant a final forfeiture to the federal government, which would indeed be a welcome development,\u201d the source said.",

Interestingly, there is something we never had in Africa that we are going to have there and that is the production of dialyzers,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governor said he hopes the centre will begin to contribute meaningfully to the state coffers in the next three years.\n\nIt is understood that the JAMB registrar assured Umahi of the board\u2019s support for the successful take-off of the varsity.\n\nEbonyi Medical University to approach NUC for approval, says spokesman\n\nThe Ebonyi Medical University had yet to be listed on the NUC\u2019s website as of the time of this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when contacted for clarification, Nweze told TheCable Lifestyle that Umahi\u2019s visit was a precursory one, adding that the NUC will soon be approached.\n\n\u201cCourses and the school need to get listed with JAMB before candidates can gain admission,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the visit was about. This thing is an ongoing process. Even the VC of the institution, the former VC of AE-FUNAI, accompanied his excellency to see the JAMB registrar for this. The school is not already running.\n\n\u201cNUC will be approached once all is ready. The [governor\u2019s] administration has about two years to go, so this school must get running fully before the administration ends. Recently, the house of assembly approved the name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting these things ready so when the NUC comes to inspect the varsity, it (accreditation) will be easy.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say that because the NUC has not been met, then JAMB should not get involved. We have departmental accreditation; we also have institutional accreditation. These things are all going hand-in-hand. That\u2019s just it.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "text": "BY DAMILOLA OLUFEMI\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, Olamide, award-winning Nigerian rapper, took to his social media to announce the release date for \u2018UY Scuti\u2018 album \u2014 about six months after he put out \u2018Carpe Diem\u2018. He kept his promise and dropped the project on Friday.\n\nSince its release, music lovers and critics have been expressing their views on the album. The project is Olamide\u2019s ninth studio album ever since he released \u2018Rapsodi\u2019 as his debut album in 2011.\n\nThe intervals at which he releases the albums are indicative of his consistency in the game. In 2016, Olamide switched from Compact Disk (CD) to streaming and has had numerous singles, album collaborations with both renowned and up-comings in the music industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis record label, YBNL, has been outstanding, distinct, and unique among other record labels of his contemporaries. The versatility of Olamide exists right from his label, YBNL, which has produced many known musicians some of which are: Adekunle Gold; Chinko Ekun; Lyta; Picazzo; Temmie Ovwasa; and the current YBNL-Empire star, Fireboy DML.\n\nIn 2020, Olamide signed a contract with a foreign label, \u201cEmpire,\u201d to work together in pushing his brands which eventually started with Fireboy DML whose album track got featured in the FIFA 2021 soundtrack.\n\nAs expected, \u2018UY Scuti\u2019 is another mind-blowing body of work. The new album has gotten the attention of many music lovers including celebrities. Seeing Olamide perform excellently on reggae beat with solemn and meaningful lyrics is commendable. The infusion of both Reggae and Afro-Pop combined in the album makes Olamide stand out, and prove he can \u201ckill\u201d any genre of music put before him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cLord of versatility\u201d has more love songs in the UY SCUTI album which can stand the test of time. The lyrics, instrumentals, and patterns executed by Olamide in the album are top-notch.\n\nWhile previous albums were exciting, \u2018UY Scuti\u2019 has again demonstrated the standard of quality delivery of Olamide. It is a convincing proof that Olamide is superb being the \u201cLord of versatility.\u201d\n\nHis previous albums released are:\n\n1. Rapsodi \u2013 (2011)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. YBNL \u2013 (2012)\n\n3. Baddest Guy Ever Liveth \u2013 (2013)\n\n4. Street OT known as Voice of the Street (VOC) \u2013 (2014)\n\n5. Eyan May Weather \u2013 (2015)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The Glory \u2013 (2016)\n\n7. Lagos Nawa \u2013 (2017)\n\n* YBNL Mafia Family (2018)\n\n8. Carpe Diem \u2013 (2020)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. UY Scuti \u2013 (2021)\n\nThe \u2018YBNL Mafia Family\u2019 album was a special collaborative album of all the YBNL artists in 2018. It was not named nor credited as an album to anyone but a joint work as a label. Some of the tracklists in the album are \u2018Ika\u2019 by Yomi Blaze featuring Olamide; \u2018Finally\u2019 by Temmie Ovwasa and Fireboy DML; \u2018Send Her Money\u2019 by DJ Enimoney, LK Kuddy, Kizz Daniel, Olamide, and Kranium.\n\nThe 10-track in the \u2018UY Scuti\u2019 album had unknown artists in it. They include Layydoe, Jaywillz, and Fave. Phyno is the only well-known artist featured in the album.\n\nTime will tell if his collaboration with the fast-rising artistes implies they are the new set of musicians to be signed into the YBNL record?\n\nWhen it comes to rap, Olamide knows his onions, and that does not exclude that with the songs he birthed on \u2018UY Scuti\u2019 album. The composure and background serenity of the songs caught the attention of many; as he was able to infuse reggae, pop, and other genres in it. That explains the fact that the entire album cuts across almost popular musical genres.\n\nIn one of the songs, \u2018So Much More,\u2019 Olamide displayed a combination of Reggae and Rap, which flows with the style of the late Nigerian music icon, Majek Fashek. The \u2018Rock\u2019 and \u2018Jailer\u2019 songs are embellished with dancehall-type beat in which Olamide poured out his mind on the type of women he likes; despite being amorous. The songs had the \u2018Rap Lord\u2019 keying to the street design in expressing his mind.\n\nThe \u2018Need for Speed\u2019 had him flashback to his starting point and his non-stop focus for the dough. \u201c\u2026Hustle gat me high standing, grinding for the dough. Destination far, time flying no be small\u2026\u201d It is of mild, solemn lyrics of R&B, filled with in-depth meaning; narrating the experiences and expectations of both upcoming, and the established in the music industry coupled with every other path of life.\n\nWhile we keep our fingers crossed on that, and more as they unveil, enjoy the new vibe of Olamide by listening to \u2018UY Scuti\u2019 and know he\u2019s qualified enough to be the \u201cLord of Versatility.\u201d\n\nDamilola Olufemi is a graduate of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko. He is a media personnel with several awards.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "text": "Timi Dakolo, Nigerian musician, says he and Busola, his wife, informed their children about how she was allegedly raped by a pastor when she was 16 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe music star spoke about the rape saga when he appeared on the latest episode of \u2018Toke Moments\u2018, a YouTube series by Toke Makinwa, media personality.\n\nThe lovebirds have been at the centre of a lingering controversy since Busola alleged that Biodun Fatoyinbo, senior pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), raped her on two occasions while she was a teenager.\n\nAlthough the clergyman dismissed the rape allegations made against him, the case has refused to die down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the show, Dakolo said his concept of raising kids is one that allows them to freely express themselves.\n\n\u201cYes, we informed our kids. I think I raised my kids differently. Children love validation. My kids can talk to me and express themselves very well. I had to make them know that their mother is a superhero. I explained that it was a painful experience that happened when their mum was very young,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey understood even though they might not know the gravity of what it was. They understood that something was happening. So, anytime they go to her, they give her a hug.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u2018Iyawo Mi\u2019 crooner also recounted the difficulty the family faced handling the matter at the time.\n\nAccording to him, his celebrity photographer wife initially found it difficult approaching him to talk about the issue and her resolve to make it public.\n\nDakolo said he remains resolute in his support for Busola because of his love for her and believes in the \u201cfor better, for worse\u201d marital vow.\n\n\u201cWhen you tell someone that, \u2018I\u2019ve got you\u2019, be true about it. Oftentimes, we associate being a man with muscle, biceps and strength. The pain that one feels that is not physical is the real pain,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen one tells one\u2019s partner, \u2018for better, for worse\u2019, most people think it is just \u2018for the better\u2019 because one cannot quantify the worse. It does not announce itself. When one says those words, one has to be sure. Don\u2019t say it because everyone is saying it. Many times, she had wanted to tell me certain things but I had waved her off. I had known about the issue and telling me was not easy for her.\u201d\n\nDakolo added that he wasn\u2019t scared that what happened to his wife would affect his brand at any point in time.\n\n\u201cNo, I was not worried that her story might affect my success. People don\u2019t get it. Someone once asked me this question and I said I would always know how to sing. In the midst of six million people, I would sing and people would notice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018man\u2019 is synonymous with responsibility and one won\u2019t need certain things when one is strong. When they say family first, it means let everything stop. It\u2019s not in the good times alone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe enjoined those going through similar experiences not to feel intimidated or ashamed in sharing their stories with the public.\n\nThe lovebirds tied the knot in 2012 and the union has been blessed with three children.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kiishu* was still running her undergraduate course when she decided to explore other parts of the country for her six-month internship program. Miles away from home in South-southern Nigeria, she was having an enjoyable learning experience, but with two months to go, she had an awful experience.\n\nShe was sexually assaulted by her host\u2019s friend, who visited, knowing his friend was away on a trip.\n\n\u201cIt was a cold and sad evening,\u201d she recounts, \u201cbut help came, albeit late.\u201d\n\nA trip to the police station provided no succour, even though they knew the culprit. She would eventually be bullied by the perpetrator\u2019s influential family to agree to arbitration outside court \u2014 presided over by her workplace\u2019s governing authority \u2014 with the culprit having only to sign an undertaking to stay away from her after admitting to the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was hard, but I agreed to take it because I had a short time to spend there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, neither my sponsors nor I could think of any other channel to get help.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, but unfortunately, varying degrees of sexual offences are still perpetrated daily, with statistics confirming an increased incidence of the global crime. The United Nations (UN) affirms that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence.\n\nDespite the Nigerian Federal Government launching its first sexual offender register in November 2019, there were so many cases of sexual violence in 2020. Consequently, all 36 state governors declared a state of emergency on rape, agreed to set up a sex offender register, and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nIn May 2021, Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nHighlighting existing response channels\n\nJust like Kiishu, most sexual assault survivors don\u2019t bother to report their experiences. Their overriding emotion is often fear that their complaints won\u2019t get the required attention, and they\u2019d either be blamed or stigmatised. There is also the possibility that the perpetrator would not be brought to book, further putting them in harm\u2019s way.\n\nHowever, the number of channels currently available to report such cases have increased compared to recent years. Victim support groups, activist movements, non-profit establishments, government-owned humanitarian agencies, and global organisations like the UN are just a few of the options available to victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA friend introduced me to this support group that helped me talk about my experience. Even though it was years after the incident, I experienced closure and felt I could properly get justice if I wanted to,\u201d Kiishu relays.\n\nApart from support groups, there is the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), a government-owned organisation that monitors trafficking and sexual-based violence cases.\n\nInterestingly, they have multiple channels \u2014 one of which I tried during my investigation \u2014 for receiving and addressing complaints.\n\nI called the conspicuously written toll-free number on the NAPTIP website and got through to a representative in less than 60 seconds; receiving a response redirecting me to the office closest to me took less than 120 seconds. While the response time was quick, I have no idea how long it would have taken to dispatch help to my location had I been in danger.\n\nThe Agency\u2019s impressive setup is the result of deliberate work done over time.\n\nMr Ganiu Aganran, NAPTIP Zonal Commander for Lagos State, who leads the Sexual and Gender-based Violence unit, tells Techpoint Africa that different tech-enabled channels have made it easier to access help.\n\n\u201cAt the headquarters, we have a 24-hour monitoring centre. When a call is put through, whatever is said is recorded and sent to the appropriate command that will handle it in real-time. We also receive SOS through the website and emails.\u201d\n\nThough he cannot speak to the number of reported cases and prosecuted offenders, he says that \u201cin the Lagos Zonal Command, sometimes, in a week, we have nothing less than 35 cases coming in, including those that come from sister law enforcement agencies through referrals.\u201d\n\nAganran says that social media has been a great tool, and with action taken to address the many cases reported on social platforms, his claim appears to be true.\n\nBetween March and June 2020, several campaigns aimed at getting justice for rape victims trended on social media.\n\nHowever, Aganran submits that the same channel is also responsible for the increasing cases of sexual violence and human trafficking.\n\nHe admits that the Agency would have been able to do more if it has more tools to work with. There are limitations apart from funding,\n\n\u201cThe issue of tracking could come in, but we do tracking through our partners, especially the DSS or the police. These are some of the law enforcement agencies that have this technology, which may not be available when we have to check the environment well to respond promptly.\u201d\n\nHowever, with relevant partnerships, he concludes that the agency can cover more ground.\n\nMore hands at work\n\nAganran attests that the Agency usually looks to partner with private organisations \u2014 for public awareness campaigns, information gathering, and referrals, among others \u2014 so it does not get overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe can never have it enough; there are challenges. The issue of logistics is key. You need to be able to move your victims when you rescue them. There are other things like going to court, going to arrest, and going for surveillance; all these demand a lot. But the truth is that working closely with partners, they also come to our aid.\u201d\n\nApart from NAPTIP partners, there are platforms operating in Nigeria that do the same thing.\n\nWhat survivors want: Enter WARIF\u2026\n\nWARIF Webpage\n\nFor obvious reasons, what a survivor wants is to be heard, cared for, and defended. The Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) is a non-profit organisation launched in 2016 to respond to and care for young girls and women who are victims of rape.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s website serves as a channel for anonymous reporting, legal and health assistance, and evidence gathering for the police. It also has a feature that allows survivors to have virtual group therapy.\n\nDuring the lockdown in 2020, it improved the platform\u2019s live chat feature and looked for cases on social media.\n\nGovernment-owned agencies also refer cases to WARIF\u2019s rape crisis centre. And Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, WARIF Founder, disclosed that the centre received up to 300 cases between March and April 2020 in Lagos State.\n\n\u2026 and Helpio app\n\nHelpio App About Page\n\nIn August 2020, Kano-based Android developer and women-in-tech advocate, Sa\u2019adat Aliyu, launched Helpio app, a platform for reporting sexual abuse cases in Nigeria.\n\nAvailable in both Hausa and English languages, users can sign up either as an emergency help centre, report anonymously, share a story, render legal assistance, or provide counselling.\n\nAliyu informs Techpoint Africa that she was inspired to build the platform during the lockdown to remove the hindrances to reporting cases of sexual and gender-based violence and get survivors closer to help.\n\nShe believes that many rape cases are unreported because of the associated stigma. History also plays a part as there are fewer cases of victims getting justice than perpetrators going scot-free.\n\nThis can be put down either to inadequate legal representation or poverty. However, there are non-governmental organisations set up solely to fight against SGBV, which provide financial, legal, medical, or even socio-psychological support to victims of sexual abuse.\n\nWithin the first ten months of launch, the platform already has support groups and certified organisations \u2014 for confidentiality \u2014 signed up to help with reported cases and emergency calls. And for cases requiring counselling, there are experts available for live chats.\n\nStill in its early stage, Aliyu says the platform undergoes regular changes to improve user experience. Subsequently, the platform will reflect real-time statistics of cases and include more localised languages.\n\nShe hopes to get more people to use the platform and render more help.\n\n\u201cThrough the app, over 50+ cases were reported, and the \u201ctalk to experts\u201d feature was among the most-used in the application.\u201d\n\nAganran explains that having recognised their reach, the government wants to take advantage of the opportunities created by platforms like WARIF and Helpio.\n\nWith more tech tools in place, there\u2019s no telling how many cases will be reported, and perpetrators brought to book.\n\nAganran believes that doing nothing isn\u2019t an option as everyone must intervene, show support, or help survivors get what they want.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

          "text": "Former Andela Community Manager, Babajide Duroshola, has stepped down as Safeboda\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria. Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "title": "Airlines, passengers hurting over Lagos airport\u2019s non-functional runway lights",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s travel sector is currently hurting as travellers and airlines operating into Lagos airport are bearing the brunt of poor infrastructure at the airport.\n\nIn the past few days, airlines have had to divert their Lagos-bound flights to Abuja because the centre line lights on 18R, the runway at the international wing, have been unserviceable.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that before now, the runway lights at 18L, the local wing, were also unserviceable, making it impossible for local airlines to land at the domestic airport at night. This situation forced local airlines to land at the international wing at night, then taxi to local airport.\n\nWith 18R and 18L (domestic and international) runway lights at Lagos airport now non-functional, it means no airline can land or take off at night at both runways.\n\nLagos airport currently processes over 65 percent passenger traffic in Nigeria and travellers bound for Lagos have had to land at Abuja airport because the runway lights at Lagos airport are bad.\n\nExperts say if the lights are not fixed in good time, Abuja airport may soon become congested and airlines may be forced to land at Accra and other neighbouring countries.\n\nOlumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that Nigeria has had the issue of non-functional runway lights for over 10 years. He said this should be a priority to government but, surprisingly, the government hasn\u2019t done anything about it.\n\nRead Also: BA diverts flight to Abuja as Lagos runway lights collapse\n\nOhunayo said that functional runway lights will improve operational services at Lagos airport, increase flight into the airport and reduce cost of operations for domestic airlines who have to taxi all the way to local airport at night.\n\nHe said government needs to expedite action on providing runway lights not just for Lagos but for all the major airports in the country.\n\n\u201cAs more airlines come on, they need more frequencies and schedules and to operate the schedules, they have to operate beyond the 6pm time. It is only when airlines have frequencies and schedules that they would be able to meet up with their leased aircraft payments,\u201d Ohunayo said.\n\n\u201cIf these frequencies are there, the fares will drop and once fares drop, you have more passengers flying. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone. And once more passengers fly, all the regular agencies would have their revenues increased. Fixing the runway lights at the airport is not a luxury but a component for improving and increasing revenue generation for all parties. It will also improve efficiency and safety,\u201d he said.\n\nBritish Airways on Saturday morning sent a message to its passengers stating clearly that its Friday flight from London to Lagos had to divert to Abuja airport due to local infrastructure issues in Lagos.\n\n\u201cBA075 Lagos \u2013 We\u2019re very sorry your flight to Lagos had to divert to Abuja due to local infrastructure issues in Lagos. Your new estimated departure time is on 19th June at 12:00 local time, arriving into Lagos at around 13:30 local time,\u201d the message said.\n\n\u201cTransport from the hotel will depart for the airport at 08:00 local time. Please continue to check ba.com/flight status,\u201d it said.\n\nOne of the passengers on the BA flight told BusinessDay that his plans for the day had been cancelled as a result of the development. The passenger said it was sad to know that the airport at Nigeria\u2019s mega city did not have functional runway lights.\n\nThe passenger, who craved anonymity, said that this was not the first time a similar situation was occurring despite airport charges passengers pay on each ticket.\n\n\u201cI hear the pilot contemplated landing in Accra. I have never heard of flights to Accra being diverted to Lagos. It is always the other way round. When it is not runway light, it is shortage of aviation fuel or one other failing. We must expose the rot at the Lagos airport. Passengers pay one of the highest airport taxes in the world and get nonsense for it,\u201d a father to one of the affected passengers lamented to BusinessDay.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that the Murtala Muhammed International Airport records about 1,540 aircraft movement monthly (arrivals and departures). This implies that the airport records about 51 aircraft movements daily. Therefore, the Lagos airport receives at least 25 arriving aircraft daily from various parts of the world and 25 aircraft departing the city to various parts of the world daily.\n\nAn international aircraft airlifts an average of 250 passengers on a flight. This implies that each day a flight is diverted instead of landing at the Lagos airport, about 6,250 arriving passengers would be affected, while operators would have to pay extra for aviation fuel, accommodation logistics and landing and parking charges at an alternate airport.\n\nTolu Odutola, a pilot and aviation expert, told BusinessDay that for now, passengers that cannot land at the airport would be catered for by the airline, as it is still the responsibility of the carrier until disembarkment while the ones that couldn\u2019t take off are FAAN\u2019s responsibility.\n\nOdutola said the situation doesn\u2019t in any way show that Nigeria is prepared to be West Africa\u2019s aviation hub, adding that to become a hub, the workers in the industry need to be equipped with the right tools to excel.\n\n\u201cWe cannot pay little or no attention to infrastructure and expect miracles to happen,\u201d he stated.\n\nSeyi Adewale, chief executive officer, Mainstream Cargo Limited, told BusinessDay that the incident is very embarrassing for the nation and particularly to the airport authorities.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, this ought to be thoroughly investigated up to escalating it as an \u2018economic and political sabotage\u2019. Anyone found culpable should be treated with the stiff penalties,\u201d Adewale said.\n\nThe immediate impact of infrastructure decay include significant increase in risks associated with Nigeria\u2019s aviation sector with negative consequences for airlines and their \u2018consumers\u2019.\n\n\u201cIf the government is serious about developing the sector, the airports need be privatized or concessioned immediately. The usual limitations or setbacks to this from the aviation unions should be tackled immediately. The Unions must recognize that they need to jettison their \u2018archaic labour theories or tendencies\u2019. The world is moving at a great speed and we must not be left behind,\u201d he said.",

The domestic money market remained very liquid, leading to low short-term interest rates.\n\nAt the fixed income securities segment yield on FGN increased, reflecting rising inflationary pressures, while the Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTB) yield declined. Similarly, yields on the CBN securities slightly moderated from the preceding month\u2019s level.\n\nGiving his views on how to stimulate activities in the financial market, Nnamdi Nwizu, co-managing partner/head, trading, Comercio Partners Limited, an investment and financial advisory company, said, \u201cIf we want rates to come back again in fixed income space to lower levels, which will make it more affordable for corporates investors to come back and start issuing securities again like what we saw towards the ends of last year when yields were low, we need to try and get foreign investors to come back.\n\n\u201cI think we need to keep growing our external reserves again because what has happened now is that we have very little participation from foreign investors and as long as that continues to happen, we would continue to see reduced participation in the fixed income and equities\u2019 space.\u201d",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, reassured that his government will sustain ongoing infrastructure projects across the state to boost economic activities and improve the lives of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are aware and know that the road has been awarded by NDDC. We make sure that we don\u2019t duplicate efforts. NDDC has not been forthcoming with contracts that have been awarded at that level.\n\n\u201cIn a normal system, if the NDDC has lived up to their responsibility and done the right thing, the government will not need to do the same project. We don\u2019t duplicate work; it amounts to a waste of funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cNDDC left the road in a worse shape than it was before the construction started. It is not an excuse to allow the people suffer, following the failure of an agency to perform their statutory responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cAs soon as possible, we would send government agencies to check the immediate state of the road and report back. We will do something quick for our people at Urhonigbe because we know that our people are predominantly farmers.\n\n\u201cWe would deploy officials from the Ministry of Infrastructure to examine the state of the road to enable us to provide palliative measures before providing a permanent solution to the road. As an administration, we will do our best to ensure that the people of the community feel the impact of the government.\u201d\n\nAppreciating the people of Ugha Quarters for the support before, during and after the governorship election in the state, the governor noted: \u201cI appreciate you for your support and prayers before, during and after the election, as well as your support throughout the time in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe last election proved to us that you trust this administration and I want to assure you that the confidence reposed in us will not be betrayed. We will deliver the dividends of democracy to the people of the State, including Ugha Quarters in Urhonigbe.\n\n\u201cAs a candidate, I visited the 192 wards of Edo State and know what the people want; I am prepared to ensure that we improve the standard of living of our people.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Odiowere of Ugha Quarters, Michael Evharevba, whose speech was read by the Secretary, Michael Omorotionmwan, congratulated the governor and his deputy on their victory in the September 2020 governorship election and the subsequent successes at the courts.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s secret police, the SSS, appears to have taken over investigation into the case of the Akwa Ibom girl who was raped and killed in April by a 20-year-old man, Uduak Akpan, who had lured her with a fake job offer.\n\nThe victim, Iniubong Umoren, 26, was buried in a shallow grave inside the suspect\u2019s family house where she was brutally killed, in the outskirts of Uyo, the Akwa Ibom capital.\n\nThe crime attracted nationwide outrage. Nigerians have been putting pressure on the police to bring her killers to justice.\n\nA former attorney general of Akwa Ibom State, Uwemedimo Nwoko, told PREMIUM TIMES last week that the SSS has taken over the investigation from the police.\n\nMr Nwoko, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, is holding brief in the case for a socio-cultural group, Ati Annang which promotes and protects the interest of the Annang, one of the ethnic nationalities in Akwa Ibom.\n\nThe late Miss Umoren was an Annang girl. She was an orphan.\n\nShe had just graduated from the Department of Philosophy, University of Uyo, and was hoping she could get a temporary job, make some decent money for herself ahead of the mandatory National Youth Service Corps.\n\nAnd then her dream was suddenly cut short in the most brutal manner.\n\n\u201cOur steps so far have actually led to the matter being further investigated because we (Ati Annang) were not satisfied with the level of investigations that the police carried out, hence we demanded that the matter should be further investigated with all loose ends tight.\n\n\u201cThe transfer of the suspect to the DSS is not a secretive thing, it is a public matter. They have taken custody of the suspect,\u201d Mr Nwoko said.\n\nWhat Mr Nwoko said about the SSS taking over the investigation was corroborated by an official of the Nigeria Correction Service in Uyo who informed PREMIUM TIMES, Friday, that the SSS about a week ago had taken the suspect, Mr Akpan, out from the Ikot Ekpene Correction Centre, along with two other suspects in the case.\n\nThe SSS, apparently conducting their own investigation into Miss Umoren\u2019s killing, took the three suspects away for some days, the correctional officer said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThey (the SSS) have just brought them (the suspects) back (to the correction centre) this evening,\u201d he added.\n\nApart from Mr Akpan who has confessed to the rape and killing of Miss Umoren, another suspect in the case is his father. The other suspect is Emem Emmanuel who is believed to have been part of the plot to lure the victim with the fake job offer.\n\nPolice reaction\n\nThe police spokesperson in Akwa Ibom, Odiko MacDon told this newspaper that the suspects were remanded in the correction centre, but he, however, denied that the case has been taken over by the SSS.\n\nThe spokesperson for the SSS in Abuja, Peter Afunanya, did not respond to calls and a text message seeking comment from him.\n\nA lawyer in Uyo who did not want his name mentioned in the report said the SSS can wade into a case that is being investigated by the police if such a case is believed to have the potential to affect \u201cstate security\u201d.\n\nIf a suspect in a criminal investigation is taken into custody by the SSS, the SSS would eventually have to return them to the police, the lawyer said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Nwoko, the lawyer who is holding brief for Ati Annang, told PREMIUM TIMES that it is the office of the attorney general of Akwa Ibom State that would prosecute the case, and not the police.\n\n\u201cIt is not a matter that the police can prosecute, that is why the case file was transferred to the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP). It is the attorney general\u2019s office that is handling the case.\n\n\u201cBoth the investigative reports of the police and that of the DSS will be put together in the same file and forwarded to the DPP for prosecution.\n\n\u201cNone of the agencies can handle it. It is a murder case, it is the office of the attorney general that is handling the matter directly,\u201d Mr Nwoko said.\n\nThe lawyer vowed that Ati Annang would ensure justice for late Miss Iniubong.\n\n\u201cI give you assurance that on our part, the Ati Annang Foundation which I represent is not going to leave any stone unturned in ensuring that justice is obtained for late Miss Umoren and indeed the society.\n\n\u201cMiss Umoren is only one victim, the society is the biggest loser when we have characters like this parading the state,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has pledged to continue to sustain democracy and democratic tenets among member-countries via the conduct of free, fair and acceptable elections.\n\nThe Chairman of ECOWAS and President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, made the pledge at the opening of the 59th ordinary summit of the authority of Heads of State and government of the organisation, held in Accra, Ghana, on Saturday.\n\nA correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) monitoring the summit reports that Akufo-Addo also used the opportunity to thank all African countries for supporting the candidacy and election of Ghana into the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member.\n\nHe also appreciated the support he had received so far from his colleagues, Presidents of countries within the West African region, and called for more collaboration, in order to move the sub-region forward.\n\nHe commended the efforts of African leaders towards sustaining democratic tenets, as he congratulated the Presidents of Niger and Benin Republics, for their recent successes at the polls.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me congratulate our brothers and colleagues, Mohammed Bazoum and Patrice Talon, who have been elected as Presidents of the Republics of Niger and Benin, since our last summit.\n\n\u201dI offer them my and the community\u2019s best wishes for their success during their terms of office.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Republics of Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Cape Verde for the conduct and outcomes of their latest legislative elections. Our region continues to strengthen its democratic credentials through the holding of successful elections.\u201d\n\nWhile thanking African leaders for supporting the election of Ghana as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, he assured the continent of a worthy representation.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the government and people of Ghana, I thank all ECOWAS and AU member States for the support of Ghana\u2019s recent successful candidate for a non-permanent seat in the United Nations\u2019 Security Council for the years 2022 and 2023.\n\n\u201cGhana received the highest number of votes on the day, with 185 out of 190 votes and it would not have been possible without your active support.\n\n\u201dI assure you that Ghana will make sure that Africa\u2019s voice is heard loud and clear in the deliberations of the Security Council, both for matters affecting our region, the African continent and on global issues and we will consult properly to define Africa\u2019s interest,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile noting with delight the planned UN reforms, Akufo-Addo stressed the need for balancing the membership of the UN Security Council in order to have African representatives on the council as permanent members.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s common position on UN reforms, based on the Ezulwini consensus, is one matter we will work hard to add to the global agenda, to solicit the backing of countries around the world for this long needed reform.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is time to correct the long standing injustice that the current structure and composition of the UN Security Council represents for the nations of Africa,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also lamented the continuous threats of terrorism, violent extremism and COVID-19, among others, to the development of Africa.\n\nIn his remarks, the Representative of the UN Secretary General\u2019s office in West Africa and the Sahel, Annadif Saleh, pledged to support the effort of ECOWAS to restore political stability in Mali.\n\nHe also welcomed what he called positive developments in Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Cape Verde.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Akinwumi Adesina thanked President Muhammadu Buahri and other African leaders for the overwhelming support they gave, leading to his re-election as the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nHe said the bank was investing massively in Africa, with over 16 billion dollars spent so far, leading to meaningful development on the continent.\n\n\u201cThe African Development Bank is investing massively in West Africa. We are delighted with the excellent relationship and partnership with the ECOWAS Commission.\n\n\u201cThe total volume of the spending portfolio of the bank in West Africa currently stands at $16 billion, the second largest for the bank anywhere in the continent.\n\n\u201dThe bank\u2019s support for infrastructure in the ECOWAS region has doubled over the past five years, increasing from two billion dollars in 2015; when I was first elected, to four billion,\u201d he said.\n\nAdesina called on African leaders to urgently address the rising security challenges on the continent, which are posing threats to development and investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cThe security index investment bonds can be delivered through special purpose vehicles, established on behalf of a pool of regional member countries. The bonds can be credit enhanced by the AfDB and other donors\n\n\u201cThe administration of the bond proceeds can be managed by the Africa Union\u2019s Peace and Security Council and regional economic communities, which includes the ECOWAS Commission.\n\n\u201cThen Your Excellencies, we all can sleep with our eyes closed, to wake up the next morning, ready to work relentlessly to Africa\u2019s assured destiny of prosperity. So, together, let us assure economic growth and prosperity for the West African region.\n\n\u201cTogether, let us build greater resilience, financial and economic resilience, climate and health resilience.\n\n\u201cTogether, let us give the region a well-financed security architecture that will secure the lives of people and enhance the attractiveness of the region as the prime investment destination.\n\n\u201dLet us mount the flag of ECOWAS on a higher mountain. Let us rise higher,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe Secretary of the organisation of Francophone countries, Louise Mushikwiwabo, expressed her organisation\u2019s support for the steps so far taken by ECOWAS to restore political stability in Mali.\n\nFormer President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, who is the ECOWAS Mediator in the Malian crisis, also briefed the summit on the progress made so far in resolving the crisis in Mali.\n\nNigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari, who is also participating in the summit, is expected back to Abuja after the meeting of the ECOWAS leaders later today.",

          "text": "Families of victims of the recent clash between unknown gunmen and police in Abia State have asked the police to release bodies of their beloved ones killed in the aftermath of the attack for burial.\n\nUnknown gunmen on May 29, invaded the State Criminal Investigation Department, CID station located at Uzuakoli Road Umuahia, and set the station on fire after releasing the inmates.\n\nHours after the assailants had fled, security operatives allegedly raided the vicinity particularly Ugwunchara area were they reportedly abducted some innocent youths.\n\nSome of the innocent youths arrested and taken away by the security agents included two cousins \u2013 Onyebuchi Anthony Amadi, 27; and Obinna Onyebuchi Egekwu, 30; as well as Emeka Awucha (popularly known as Onye Photo), 36.\n\nThe victims\u2019 bodies were later found at the mortuary of the Federal Medical Centre, FMC Umuahia on May 31 where they were dumped by the security agents who claimed they were some of the unknown gunmen killed in a cross fire with security agents during the attack at the state CID.\n\nAgents to release the body of their son for burial, insisting that he was not an unknown gunman contrary to claims by the security agents.\n\nAn elder brother to one of the victims, Chibuike Awucha, 47, from Amagbo Ozuitem in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, said that the ordeal of the family had been made worse by the refusal of the police to release the body of the victims for burial.\n\nNarrating the pathetic story of how his younger brother, Emeka, met his untimely death, the tricycle operator said the victim was murdered in cold blood by security agents who arrested him while returning from the coverage of a wedding event.\n\nAccording to him, the victim, a father of two, had gone to cover a wedding event as a photographer, and on his way back home he was arrested along with some other innocent youths and taken away by security agents.\n\nHe alleged that the victims were later killed by the security agents and labelled unknown gunmen.\n\nHis words: \u201cThat day, my brother was returning from a wedding event. He had his video camera, two phones and N35,000 which was given to him for the production of the work he covered.\n\n\u201c On his way home the security agents arrested him at Ugwunchara and took him away with other boys they arrested.\n\n\u201c Later on Monday we heard that some bodies were deposited at the FMC mortuary by the police. And when we got there we found him among the corpses.\n\n\u201c We saw his bag but none of his phones, video camera and the advance money paid to him for the job he covered was there.\n\n\u201c When we wanted to carry his corpse the mortuary people told us to get authorization form the police. We went to the police, the police said they were not the people that killed them.\n\n\u201c They said they were killed by unknown gunmen and that we should go to unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that police could parade my brother, a popular photographer in Umuahia as unknown gunman, and deny killing him while they arrested him alive.\n\n\u201c All we want now is that his corpse should be released to us for burial. The family is devastated. His two children \u2013 one is in Primary three and the other in Primary one: who will train them?\n\n\u201c We don\u2019t know where to locate the unknown gunmen for their permission to collect the body of my brother. We want the Government to come to our rescue and prevail on the hospital authority to release the body to us\u201d.\n\nThe 47-year old who was intermittently battling to fight back his tears as he narrated the pathetic story appealed to Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu to come to the rescue of the affected families who he said were now in confusion.\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Geoffrey Ogbonna, said he did not know which police station the families went to in search of the letter of authorization.\n\nHe said the affected families should not just make oral application but put their request in writing.\n\nOn the claims by the family that the victims were arrested alive and later killed by the police, the PPRO said \u201cit sounds very strange to allege that police arrested the victims and later killed them\u201d.",

          "title": "Global economic crisis: Is Nigeria ready for renewable energy transition?",
          "text": "\u2026Osinbajo advises a more equitable transition\n\n\u2026Gas, our own renewable energy \u2013 Sylva\n\n\u2018\u2026Stakeholders\u2019 collaboration needed\u2019\n\n\u2026 Nigeria ready, but\u2026- Expert\n\nThe world is moving from fossil fuel to renewable energy, but many have been left wondering whether or not Nigeria, with its dependence on oil as a major source of revenue, is ready for this global shift. BENJAMIN UMUTEME writes.\n\nIn 1957, when Nigeria discovered oil in Oloibiri, in the present day Bayelsa state, most people thought the country was set to become a global super player, but it was not to be. Rather, the country\u2019s economy has continued to struggle especially with the volatility of the oil market in recent times.\n\nWith the discovery of oil, Nigeria left its other sources of revenue without a look into the future. While the country made so much money from the sale of crude oil, it failed miserably to invest the money in critical sectors of the economy and, by extension, the oil sector, thereby stalling investments in the industry.\n\nAnd then the coronavirus pandemic hit the world economy making Nigeria\u2019s inability to make hay while the sun was shining obvious. By April last year, oil prices had entered negative territory and with it the need for the global economy began to look at cleaner and cheaper sources of energy to power production.\n\nEnergy transition/issues\n\nMany say the next transformation in human civilisation now occurs in the energy sector. Already, the transition has started disrupting oil exporting economies like Nigeria that depend heavily on oil for its economic activities.\n\nEnvironmental issues are one of the major problems facing humans today. Emissions from energy use, resource depletion and waste generation from production and consumption activities and many other anthropogenic activities impacts the globe adversely, consequently, the growing attention on energy transition and circular economy.\n\nFossil fuel has played a critical role in socio-economic development and international relations of countries over the last 120 years. However, climate change and air pollution have increased the inevitability to consider the use of fossil fuels. The major problem with fossil fuel use is greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions.\n\nThe GHGs\u2014N2O, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) have increased by 20 per cent, 40 per cent, and 150 per cent above pre-industrial level. In the 1880s, during the industrial revolution, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 was about 280 parts per million (ppm).\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, it was 399 and 403.9 ppm, respectively, representing a 30 per cent increase above pre-industrial level. Emissions from combustion of fossil fuel account for 65 per cent of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere varies between 50 to 200 years. About two-thirds of global GHGs emissions come from energy production and consumption. Between 1880 and 2012, the average temperature of the globe increased by 0.85 \u2103.\n\nPresently, there are increased variations in temperatures and severe weather, resulting in increased degrees and incidences of hot days across most regions of the globe; thus, the present emphasis on renewable energy.\n\nActions that support sustainable development and advancement throughout all segments of the human environment are critical to human civilisation. Transition from \u201chydrocarbon molecules to electrons\u201d (fossil fuels to renewable and low-carbon energy) is growing globally.\n\nAs it stands, renewable energy technologies are becoming more cost-competitive relative to fossil fuels. The increasing transition will have serious socio-economic and political implications if the country does not diversify its economy. For instance, the contraction in oil export because of global transition to renewable energy will reduce the government\u2019s revenue, increase unemployment, decrease capacity to finance infrastructure and development projects, and increase poverty rate.\n\nNigeria has enormous renewable energy potential, solar, wind, biomass, among others. The use of renewable will improve environmental quality including increased use of biomass (organic wastes) for energy production which would advance Nigeria solid waste management system and vice versa. All these are associated with sustainable resource management.\n\nTotal\u2019s initiative, others\u2019 strategies\n\nIn a bid to drive home the reality of the transition to cleaner source of energy, oil major Total Exploration re-branded to Total Energies. This, the company said, signals its new strategy of diversification towards cleaner energy sources.\n\n\u201cThe group is expressing its intention to transform itself into a multi-energy company to respond to the twin challenges faced by energy transitions: more energy and fewer emissions,\u201d Total\u2019s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement.\n\nThis year, Total plans to devote more than 20 per cent of its investment budget to renewable energy sources as well as electricity. But environmental activists say it must do more to fight climate change, and recently the International Energy Agency said all future fossil fuel projects must be scrapped if the world is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nSimilarly, several international oil firms are already realigning their operations and reducing investments in upstream activities with a view to embracing cleaner fuels. Even European Banks are becoming reluctant to support new investments in fossil fuels.\n\nCountries, even the least expected to comply, are making commitments to a carbon-free world.\n\nChina has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060, India has committed to a target of achieving 40 per cent of its total electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, the UK sees the country carbon neutral by 2050 and for the first time, in 2020, renewable overtook fossil fuels as the European Union\u2019s main source of electricity.\n\nThe president, Nigerian Gas Producers, Ed Ubong, noted that gas will continue to play a key role as green fuel as we try to meet the renewable target as the country try to meet its sustainable energy demand.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria is sitting on a huge reserve of gas. We must utilise the gas we have. We must unlock the challenge that exists in the gas to power value chain and improve power to energy for the over 85 million Nigerians. We must address structural issues around the grid.\n\n\u201cHow do we reduce distribution losses, how do we ensure that payment happens, how do we ensure that gas plants get gas reliably.\u201d Here-in is the dilemma for Nigeria and most emerging economies that still rely heavily on \u2018dirty fuel.\u2019\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s admonition\n\nHowever, in what looks like a plea to the European Union, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has urged developed countries to adopt a more equitable energy transition for the developing world. According to the vice-president, they ought to recognise the significant differences between different fuels and the context of their use.\n\nHe is of the view that there should be a gradual adoption and implementation of the transitioning scheme for fossil fuels, especially for Africa\u2019s developing economies with huge energy access gaps.\n\n\u201cThe path to de-carbonisation by 2050 needs to solve energy poverty by 2030, or that demand will be met through dirty energy sources,\u201d he said.\n\nFG\u2019s regrets\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, regrets that Nigeria does not have the resources to go into renewable at the moment. He, however, does believe that for Nigeria, gas is a bridge to achieving its own renewable energy.\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend recently in Abuja, Sylva said while the world is moving towards clean energy, Nigeria would be transiting to gas, which it considers as its own clean energy.\n\n\u201cSo, should we also join them now to move to renewable energy and abandon our resources? I don\u2019t think so, and I say it boldly everywhere. After all, those economies were built on resources from coal and other dirtier fuels,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister was rather confident that with the county\u2019s abundant gas resources Nigeria would gradually transit to renewable. According to him, the country does not have the huge funds needed to go into clean energy research.\n\n\u201cOkay, today, they have moved to this level. In a situation where 600 million Africans are still without energy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a realistic position. That\u2019s why in Nigeria, our focus now is on gas which we consider at best a destination fuel and at worst a transition fuel to renewable.\n\n\u201cAnd since we have it in abundance why don\u2019t we maximise it now so that at least we are taking a step forward as well. That\u2019s our position in Nigeria, not necessarily that we want to go into developing renewable. In energy usually, there must be a mix. You are not expected to use only one source of energy. Our focus now is on gas as a major source of energy which we have in abundance.\n\n\u201cThe global energy industry is moving towards renewable even the investors are taking out investable funds from the oil and gas sector and moving into renewable. Is Nigeria also joining that race?\n\n\u201cIt is something that is difficult to say. We are not in that race as such. There\u2019s a lot of funding required for research for renewable and we are not into that yet. But for Nigeria, we are looking at gas as a transition fuel to renewable.\u201d\n\nHe said further: \u201cSome people are even looking at gas not as a transition fuel, but as renewable. If you have gas you can consider it to be renewable fuel as well. The question I always ask when I go for international events is: if the concern with non renewable is carbon emission, why is the global economies are now focusing on developing carbon capture technologies instead of moving away from the non renewable?\n\n\u201cIf the global economy is focused on carbon capture, we can actually clean up the fuel as well and reduce the emission from non renewable, clean it and it becomes something that will not affect climate change. But the global system tends to be moving away from the oil and gas non renewable resources which we have in abundance.\n\n\u201cIn energy usually, there must be a mix. You are not expected to use only one source of energy. Our focus now is on gas as a major source of energy which we have in abundance.\u201d\n\nA gradual process?\n\nOn his part, the maintenance/project manager, Servon Nigeria Limited, Anderson Aleru, told this reporter that Nigeria was ready for the energy transition.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a gradual process; natural resources like gas are something we have in sufficient quantities and the federal government wants to really start producing gas so that we can also convert it to supply electricity.\n\n\u201cIt will take time because to be able to build a central processing facility for this gas is very expensive. It\u2019s going to be a gradual process since funds will be involved,\u201d he said.\n\nStakeholders\u2019 role\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint Weekend on the sidelines of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS), the general manager, Sales of Global Process and Pipeline Limited (GPSS), Taiwo Abiodun, said energy transition can only be possible if all hands are on deck.\n\nAccording to him, with its abundant gas resources, Nigeria can use gas as a transition to clean energy.\n\nHe said, \u201cPresently, Nigeria is generating a certain percentage of gas but you can also see that with what is happening, what we are suffering with insecurity, what we are suffering about all the issues that affect crude and all that, the future is basically inherent in gas production. And how can that happen?\n\n\u201cYou will also agree with me that a lot of Nigerian companies have been given license to do a whole lot of local refineries just to support what the national companies are also doing. Why, because renewable energy is the future of the world globally. Everybody needs gas! Gas is life now! For us to even have light here, we need gas.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to pull our forces together to make sure that there is a high-level of improved production of hydrocarbons in Nigeria through our collaboration working with the right stakeholders and make sure that we deliver what we can do.\n\n\u201cWe have the resources, we have the technology, and we have the capability in Nigeria. What is lacking is that collaboration. If everybody, all IOCs, all technical persons came together to say \u2018hey, let us give it a try, let us take it over,\u2019 in the next 10 years, there will be less of crude and there is going to be more of gas because everywhere the talk is about renewable.\n\n\u201cJust last week, Total Exploration Nigeria changed to Total Energies. Now, Total is already thinking of a 10-20 years plan into renewable energy. What do you need to drive renewable energy? You need gas; you need hydrocarbons to drive it. And that is probably going to be the future everybody wants to hear.\u201d\n\nPIB?\n\nIn his view, an economist, Friday Efih, said a quick passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will quicken the energy transition for the country.\n\nAccording to the expert, the inability of the legislature to pass the PIB for the past 12 years is a drawback to investments in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cAs it stands now, one cannot out rightly say Nigeria is ready for energy transition especially with the kind of money involved in changing to renewable,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "This year, Total plans to devote more than 20 per cent of its investment budget to renewable energy sources as well as electricity.\nHe, however, does believe that for Nigeria, gas is a bridge to achieving its own renewable energy.\nThe minister was rather confident that with the county\u2019s abundant gas resources Nigeria would gradually transit to renewable.\nOn his part, the maintenance/project manager, Servon Nigeria Limited, Anderson Aleru, told this reporter that Nigeria was ready for the energy transition.\nAccording to him, with its abundant gas resources, Nigeria can use gas as a transition to clean energy.",

We are here to let them know that they can enhance their livelihoods through specific digital training while leveraging their God-given talents and skills.\n\n\u201cOur core mission is to eradicate hunger, and we can only do that if our communities have the necessary tools and knowledge to lift them out of poverty,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAlso speaking, the Secretary of the Kwachingoro IDP camp, Abuja, , Mr. Luka Yathuma, expressed appreciation to NHI-IndigoAfrica-NHFBS management for the initiative and urged other groups and individuals to emulate such gesture.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to No Hunger Initiatives (NHI). Our people have suffered but we thank NHI for always coming to our aid with food and other essential items.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to NHI for this training, my people would have used their meagre monetary resources to receive the training but now, NHI is offering it to us free. Thank you, thank you, thank you,\u201d he said.\n\nYathuma disclosed that no fewer than 30 internally displaced persons attended the \u2018Dignified IDP\u2019 training, comprising 20 young women and 10 young men.\n\n\u201cWe are excited that 67 per cent of the trainees are young women. From a gender perspective, this gendered result will further inform NHI\u2019s EAT programme towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related initiatives like \u2018girls-and-boys-who-code,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday called on West African leaders to exert pressure on the military leadership in Mali to ensure that the transition process in the country is not aborted.\n\nHe made the call in his statement delivered at the 59th Ordinary session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS in Accra, Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian leader spoke on the situation in Mali which was recently suspended from the regional bloc due to a military coup.\n\n\u201cAt this Summit today, we are expected to review a number of important reports dealing with various issues of concerns to our organisation and people. In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions which will positively impact our citizens,\u201d he was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu.\n\nPresident Buhari added, \u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of government they want.\n\n\u201cPressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is halfway to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201cA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is unfortunately under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader, therefore, appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as being \u2018clearly under siege\u2019.\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, the President cautioned them not to perpetuate acts that would facilitate the destabilisation and destruction of Mali.\n\n\u201cI urge our organization to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute Mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly, for his untiring efforts thus far.\n\n\u201cI encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Libya, President Buhari faulted the recent United Nations Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya, without first ensuring that they were disarmed.\n\nHe lamented that while the decision was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders has created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region.\n\nThe President warned that this could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the Nigerian leader at the Summit also addressed other pertinent issues of concern in the organisation, including the ongoing institutional reforms in ECOWAS.\n\nDeclaring Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reforms process, he said he looked forward to an ECOWAS that would be \u2018fit for purpose\u2019, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nHe commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\nIn his capacity as the ECOWAS champion on the fight against COVID-19, President Buhari also drew attention to the need for more citizens in the region to be vaccinated, stressing the need for adherence to other non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nHe said the West African region was in the grip of a third wave, warning against complacency in national and regional initiatives to address the pandemic.\n\nPresident Buhari reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the noble objectives of the organisation, saying, \u201cI encourage us to take bolder steps towards ensuring that the organisation fulfils the aspirations of its founding fathers, which include a truly integrated sub-region, economically, politically, socio-culturally united and secured to permit its sustainable development and growth.\u201d",
