Atiku Bagudu, commended the president for signing the Electoral Bill Amendment Act 2022 into law.\n\nAccording to Bagudu, all the 22 APC governors are strongly united and ready for the party\u2019s national convention slated for March 26.\n\nHe, therefore, dismissed the assertion that the governors were yet to resolve their differences over the forthcoming March 26 convention.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, also updated the president on the progress report over the on-going negotiation between Federal Government and Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nNAN reports that ASUU has embarked on one month warning strike on Feb. 14, to press home their demands about N1.2 trillion.\n\nThe union also want the federal government to adopt the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) payment platform.\n\nNgige, who spoke to State House correspondents at the end of the meeting with the president on March 1, said the federal government had so far paid over N92 billion as earned allowances and revitalisation fee to federal owned universities across the country.\n\nHe said this was part of the implementation of the 2020 December agreement reached with the ASUU.\n\nThe president, who returned to Abuja on Friday after participating in the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme ([email protected]) in Nairobi, Kenya, joined Muslim faithful to observe the Friday Jumma\u2019at prayer at Aso Villa Mosque.\n\nWhile in Kenya, Buhari participated in the Special Session to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the United Nation\u2019s body.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cAs we celebrate the 50th anniversary of UNEP\u2019s existence, we laud the efforts of UNEP and encourage broader action to overcome climate change, biodiversity, rising levels of pollution and waste being three major crises threatening our planet.\u201d\n\nThe president also met with Mr Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in Nairobi.\n\nDuring the meeting, Buhari directed collaboration between the Ministries of Environment, Water Resources, Agriculture and Rural Development and Power to combat desertification.\n\n\n\nNAN\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Constitutional reviews are a unique opportunity for countries to rectify anomalies in how they are governed but the recent amendments fell short of the expectations of the entirety of Nigerian women.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cOur disappointment beyond all reasonable doubt stems from the following 3 key points:\n\nDenying 35 percent appointed positions for women and settling for 20 percent; Denying women affirmative action in party administration and leadership; and Denying specific seats for women in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAs the 2023 elections draw nearer this would have been a wonderful opportunity to test and implement these key changes to our polity so that Nigerian women can feel not only a sense of belonging but contribute their intelligence and brilliance.\n\n\u201cSince the return of democracy Nigerian Women have been at the forefront of supporting Nigeria\u2019s democracy structures. Every election cycle they have come out in huge numbers to vote and contribute their quota to the democratic experiment.\n\n\u201cNigerian women have oftentimes been recipients of the violence that had come from elections and political processes that have failed.\n\n\u201cThis was a unique opportunity that the National Assembly had let slide and has indeed turned back the hands of time in our democratic experience. It is in our view that Nigerian women deserve better and should not continually be treated as second-class citizens but as equal partners in nation-building.\n\n\u201cNigerian lawmakers should urgently revisit this faux pas in order to redress this great injustice meted to Nigerian women or risk losing the support of the bulk of Nigerian women.

          "text": "By Chioma Obinna\n\nThe Executive Director, Youth Development and Empowerment Initiative, YEDI, Tomisin Adeoye has appealed to Federal and State governments to pay more attention to Neglected Tropical Diseases, NTDs, by increasing awareness, as well as making drugs available for victims\u2019 treatments.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, WHO, Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of 20 conditions that are mainly prevalent in tropical areas, where they mostly affect impoverished communities and disproportionately affect women and children.\n\nREAD ALSO:Over 2000 members of PDP, APC decamp to APGA in Ebonyi \u2015 State Chairman\n\nThese diseases such as Elephantiasis cause devastating health, social and economic consequences to more than one billion people across the world.\n\nStatistics available have shown that about 1.5 billion people are affected by NTDs globally and Nigeria contributes not less than 40 percent of the global burden of NTDs.\n\nSpeaking during an NTDs outreach organised for residents of Precious Seed Community, Ferry, Oworoshoki area of Lagos, Adeoye lamented that lack of awareness and non-availability of drugs were affecting NTDs treatments in Nigeria.\n\nAdeoye said: \u201cbecause the diseases are neglected, the government should make information and drugs available, adding that out of ignorance, many sufferers are using some drugs that do not align with the individual disease.\n\nShe disclosed that YEDI has taken the NTDs outreach to Mile 12 where two cases of elephantiasis were discovered.\n\nShe said the outreach was strictly to create awareness and enlighten residents about the disease and what to do when they discover such conditions among them.\n\nStating that the outreach was in collaboration with the Lagos State Ministry of Health and the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH, she explained that the choice of Kosefe local government was made with guidance from the State Ministry of Health as Kosefe is prone to NTDs due to overcrowdedness. \u201cWe have found out that people living around here are at risk of the various diseases due to the dirty environment and the fact that they live too close to the water.\n\nLamenting the level of ignorance about the diseases, he said \u201cThe general belief is that these diseases do not exist but they do but the problem is that people don\u2019t have the information, they do not know where to go and where to get help.\n\n\u201cThat is why YEDI is intervening in communities like this to create awareness on the disease and also refer people that we see for a further medical treatment which is free. Most times, they believe is the village people that brought it upon them not knowing that it is a treatable disease.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to reach at least 500 people in Kosofe. We are also sensitising the people on the need to keep their environment clean. We are also carrying out screening for malaria and hepatitis. We have also identified some people living with Hepatitis.\n\nAdeoye disclosed that the campaign is being funded by EndFund through the Street Football World. We are planning sessions with young people; we have developed a curriculum for students.\n\nShe said YEDI is targeting to reach 1,000 people by June and two million through social media.\n\nSpeaking, the Community Secretary for Precious seed Community Oworoshoki, Mr Adewale Ogunusi, who appreciated the gesture done to his people said the enlightenment programme was an eye-opener on NTDs for his people. \u201cWe are also happy that they were able to enlighten our people on NTDs and what to do when we have such problems.",

The farm currently has about one thousand persons in its employ.",

Thus, $1 million multiplied by the 743,490MW that the company could not transit, translates to $743,490,000 loss in the period under review.\n\nThis energy production data is contained in the \u201cPower Sector Data 2021: Energy Generated and Sent Out,\u201d of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThe Nation obtained the document yesterday in Abuja.\n\nThe document shows that the Electricity Generation Companies (GenCos) produced 36, 639,920MW in the year under review.\n\nIt stated this in its document, titled: Power Sector data 2021: Energy Generated and Sent Out, by NBS.\n\nThe document shows that in the period under review, the TCN wheeled 35,654,430MW to the 11 DisCos, indicating that the TCN failed to wheel 743,490MW in 2021.\n\n\u201cIn general, total generation in 2021 stood at 36,397.92 (GWh), while 35,654.43 (GWh) was transmitted,\u201d said the NBS.

We must change our slogan, as education of every child matters,\u201d Oloyede said.\n\nSpeaking on the new professor, the JAMB registrar recalled that her father gave birth to seven daughters, some of whom include doctor, pharmacist and lecturer.\n\nAccording to him, giving birth to only females by the father of the professor has not reduced anything from him; it is even an indication that everyone must strive to educate their children \u2013 males or females.\n\nIn their separate lectures, Prof. Afis Oladosu of the Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies at UI and Dr. Khadijat Shobowale of Lagos State University (LASU), stressed the importance of education.\n\nShobowale said Islam makes seeking of knowledge compulsory for any gender.\n\n\u201cMore than 800 verses of the Qur\u2019an reiterate the importance of knowledge. So, there is definitely no reason for you not to get educated.\n\n\u201cIf you have people who are still preventing the girl-child from getting educated, it should be attributed to societal and cultural norms, and not Islam,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her remarks, Mrs. Balogun said the celebration of the girl-child education was borne out of the need to increase awareness on more effective utilisation of women.\n\nShe added that the celebration was also to show her appreciation to God and her husband, who has been a pillar of support to her.",

We do not parade suspects. We have never paraded any suspects. That is the truth. I have never brought any suspects before newsmen. What we do most times is that when we issue a statement on our activities, we select some pictures of the exhibits, sometimes with the suspects there, just to show the public because we have a very cynical society that even with pictures, still a number of people would say it is not possible.\n\n\u201cSo, you sometimes need pictures or videos to support the statement you are issuing out so that people can actually see and believe that. Beyond that some of these things also serve as deterrent to would-be offenders or those who are already in such line of criminality so that they can see that one day they can also be caught.\n\n\u201cI would love to state that the NDLEA did not file charges against these individuals just yesterday. The charges were filed against them since February 28, 2022. The matter has been assigned to a judge and the suspects are due for arraignment in court on Monday, March 7, before Court 8 of the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThis is to correct the insinuation that probably the NDLEA rushed to court to go and file charges after extradition charges were filed against one of the key suspects.\n\n\u201cIn our case, we have charged seven persons, not just an individual alone. This is to correct the impression so that people would not keep reading unnecessary meaning into certain actions by the agency,\u201d he said.",

Liquidity ratio at 41.33 per cent was also higher than 30 per cent prudential requirement.\n\nAlso, both Returns on Assets and Returns on Equity fell in December 2021 relative to December 2020 while operating costs to income rose from 68.2 per cent in December 2020 to 73.1 per cent in December 2021.\n\nIn her notes, CBN Deputy Governor, Aishah Ahmad, reaffirmed Adenikinju\u2019s position that the financial system maintained its resilience into 2022.\n\nShe said data provided by apex bank staff indicated stability in broad soundness indicators and an unprecedented improvement in asset quality, even as credit to the private sector continued to grow.\n\nThe growth in credit to manufacturing, general commerce and oil and gas sectors achieved amidst continued decline in non-performing loans ratio from 5.10 per cent in November 2021 to 4.94 per cent in December 2021 (six basis points below the regulatory benchmark) for the first time in over a decade, Ahmad said.\n\nThe CBN deputy governor said the stress test results showed resilience of banks\u2019 solvency and liquidity ratios in response to potential severe macroeconomic shocks.\n\nShe said: \u201cHowever, the CBN must remain vigilant to proactively manage probable macro risks to the financial system such as lingering spillover effects of the pandemic, winding down of forbearance measures, and myriad risks to financial stability including exchange rate, operational and cyber security risks.\u201d\n\nAnother MPC member, Prof. Obadan Idiahi, expressed concerns over Nigeria\u2019s surging public debt.\n\nHe described as worrisome that external debt was growing more than the target of 40.0 per cent of total debt stock in relation to domestic debt of 60.0 per cent.",

          "text": "From Tony Osauzo, Benin\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, at the weekend, said he has no plan of defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), urging anyone who is uncomfortable with his leadership of the party to leave.\n\nThe governor, who stated that the party is now fully harmonized, stressed that the constitution of the party bequeaths him with the leadership of the party in the state, a position which is not up for contest by anyone.\n\nHe said this during an expanded caucus meeting of leaders and members of the PDP in the state.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave PDP. I will not decamp from the PDP; we will always win any election. PDP won in the last election and we will continue to win all elections in the state and country; nothing will stop us as a party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor stated that the forthcoming local government election in the state will set the template for next year\u2019s national and legislative elections, urging party members to reflect on the elections and work in unity to ensure victory in the polls.\n\n\u201cThere is no division in Edo PDP. Let the party be open to accommodate others. PDP is democratic. The hallmark of democracy is ensuring that the majority has their way, as the minority can\u2019t dictate to the people.\n\n\u201cI heard that Chief Dan Orbih went around, saying there is no harmonization in Edo PDP. This is really irresponsible to say and an insult to members of the party, as the party has truly harmonised in the state.\n\n\u201cPDP in Edo State is harmonised because before we made any appointments in any ward, we made sure the party at that level was harmonised. We are gathered here now as election timetable is out; harmonisation has been done, appointments made and we are ready to win any election before us\u201d, he explained.\n\nObaseki disclosed that the PDP National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu will visit the state on Thursday 10th of March 2022, urging party leaders to bring along five percent of newly registered members to welcome the party chair.\n\n\u201cPolitics is not about fighting but dialogue and discussion. I urge us to collaborate and unite to move the party and state forward,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nThe governor also announced that over 539,000 members have been registered in the ongoing e-registration exercise, adding \u201cThese numbers are not fabricated as we have the data, pictures, emails and phone numbers of members of the party we have registered so far. You have broken records as this is the bastion of PDP in Nigeria. We have changed the face of politics in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t give leaders any resources to mobilize them but rather they challenged themselves and achieved the goal to register more members in the state.\n\n\u201cSome people went around saying people should not join our party. No true party man will do that. Those that engaged in that are not true members of the party and don\u2019t belong to Edo PDP. If not, they will not push people away from the party.\n\n\u201cOur focus now is on how to engage our members, making them participate in the policy-making process of the party. We don\u2019t need to wait for an election before we act\u201d, he stressed.\n\nThe governor while harging detractors sponsoring disunity in the state to stop forthwith, said, \u201cEdo is Edo, leave Edo State alone. They have tried us in battle, and have been made to know that we are battle-ready. We have been tested and trusted. We must always win elections; we must always win as a party\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman PDP Edo State, Anthony Aziegbemi, said \u201cEdo State is the only state in the nation that has surpassed the 500,000 thresholds for e-registration of the party.\u201d\n\nOthers at the meeting include the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu; Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA), Hon. Marcus Onobun; Senator Matthew Urhoghide; Senator Clifford Odia; Chief Tom Ikimi; Hon.

He said the foundation has not only created room for quality engagement of good governance, but it has also established a leadership prize to encourage excellence and distinction in service to society. \u201cThese are some of the values that Chief Awolowo embodied in his lifetime service to Nigeria. As a leader, he displayed a heart that was consistent with courage and commitment. It is said that evil that men do lives after them while their good deeds are often interred with them. But the reverse is the case with Chief Awolowo. As a politician, lawyer and statesman, he loomed large, not just in Nigeria but also in Africa and the world at large. His good works became the standard of excellence in the annals of our nation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended him for making free education and health the core of his programmes as a political; the programmes that the federal government under him adopted for the whole country between 1974/75. \u201cHistory will be kind to him,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also described Awolowo as a visionary and transformative leader, who pursued and demonstrated that leadership was not a rocket science.\n\nHe also commended the chairman of the occasion and former President of Ghana, John Dramani Mahama for accepting to grace the occasion without an argument. \u201cIt only shows the strength of the cultural and political ties between Nigeria and Ghana,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn his remarks, former President Mahama noted that as a journalist, lawyer, politicians and statesman, Chief Awolowo was humble, modest, resilient and has unquestionable love for Nigeria.\n\nHe lamented that those values that Chief Awolowo embodied were conspicuously lacking not only in Nigeria but in Africa as a whole. \u201cHis unquestionable love for Nigeria is among the values that are lacking in Africa today. What we are going through today was what the western world that we admire today went through in the past but their value of love for one another and selflessness are what differentiate them from the Africans,\u201d he said.\n\nHe charged Africa to analyse the phase that the world is going into having gone through the era of global village, climate change, epidemic and currently COVID 19 pandemic, so that Africa can fit into the new world.\n\nParticipants at the virtual event included former governor of Osun State, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola; Dr. Josephine Soboyejo; the Obi of Onitsha, Nnaemeka Achebe; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; Minister of State for Health, Olurumibe Mamora, former South African President, Thabo Mbeki, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, former Governor of Ondo State, Segun Mimiko, and Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammed Saad Abubakar among others.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "title": "2022 International Women Day: Nigerian women berate NASS",
          "text": "By Enyeribe Ejiogu and Christy Anyanwu\n\nNot a few people exchanged messages of goodwill on Tuesday, March 1, as they wished one another \u201cHappy New Month\u201d via SMS and on various social media platforms. But at the National Assembly, a wholly different situation was brewing for the Nigerian women.\n\nWhen the two chambers of the National Assembly convened to vote on the bills amending several provisions of the Constitution, civil society organisations and many other interest groups that had advocated for specific amendments waited with bated breath, anticipating endorsement of the amendments they championed.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nBy the time the votes were cast, Nigerian women were left in shock as the major bills that pertained to, and were of great interest to them were literally thrown into the legislative trash cans of the two chambers of the 9th National Assembly.\n\nReacting to the news, a Senior Lecturer at Bells University of Technology, Dr (Mrs) Nkiru Ifekwem, who is also a gender expert and public analyst, characterised what transpired on the floors of the Senate and House of Representative on that fateful March 1 as the annihilation of women in Nigeria, in a year when the theme for the 2022 International Women Day, marked annually on March 8 is, \u201cTime to Break the Bias.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to comment on the readiness of women to break the bias against them, Dr Ifekwem retorted: \u201cHow can we say that women are ready to break the bias when the women that most Nigerian women look up were in Dubai, instead of being at the National Assembly on the day women in Nigeria were being annihilated in the name of constitutional amendment?\u201d\n\nPrior to the final vote on the proposed constitutional amendments, the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari had led a special delegation comprising the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen and other notable women to the floors of the two legislative chambers of the National Assembly to observe their special plenary sessions, in demonstration of her personal support and commitment to seeing the women-centric bills become part of the amendments to the constitution.\n\nAmong the issues of major concern to women were: reserving specific seats for women in the National Assembly, giving citizenship to the foreign-born husband of a Nigerian woman, allowing women to become indigenes of their husband\u2019s state of origin after five years of being together, 35 per cent appointed positions for women and women 35 per cent affirmative action in party administration and leadership.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nIn a very real sense, the visit of the First Lady and earlier efforts ultimately did not sway the legislators as all the issues so dear to the heart of Nigerian women were thrown out by the National Assembly, which incidentally had only a five per cent female membership.\n\nWithout doubt, women have always faced gender bias, which Ifekwem explained as \u201cbehaviour that shows favouritism towards one gender over another,\u201d noting that it is a common stance in this part of the world.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge or rather it is obvious that men and boys are favoured over women and girls.\n\n\u201cYou see, having a baby boy seems a greater achievement than a baby girl even when it is a fact that girls take care of their aged parents more than boys. We normally hear that someone had a bouncing baby boy as if a baby girl doesn\u2019t bounce. Remember the advert, \u2018Mama, na boy\u2019, which a GSM telecommunication company once ran several years ago. Female activists fought to stop further broadcast of the television commercial as it was considered discriminatory to the baby girl. In spite of the little improvement we have in the gender space, there is still bias, stereotyping and discrimination against women.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that women in Nigeria have not shown enough readiness to break the bias. Women are still caught up with so many frivolities instead of the main issues that affect them. Talk of intra-gender animosity, women in different spheres of life still fight with each other instead of supporting each other for growth; there is much pettiness and unnecessary envy.\u201d\n\nIn Ifekwem\u2019s view, the National Assembly clearly indicated that women in Nigeria are irrelevant.\n\n\u201cWe are looking out to see if the women agree that they are. Going through history, I feel for the women that laid their lives for us during the Aba Women Riot over 90 years ago. With all our education now, the technology, the awareness and globalisation, Nigeria is still the way it is today and we women are not ready to sacrifice the way our less educated sisters did 90 years ago. The likes of Margaret Ekpo and Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti are definitely disappointed with us in their grave. They can never believe that there are only seven female senators out of 109 members and 12 female House of Representatives members out of 360 members in the 9th assembly and Nigeria has never had a female governor except the opportune and accidental case of Mrs Virgy Etiaba, who became governor after Peter Obi got impeached in Anambra State,\u201d she said with an obvious sad tone.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe pain of Ifekwem is shared by Prof Remi Sonaiya, a politician, educationist and writer. She was the only female presidential candidate in 2015 general election on the platform of KOWA Party.\n\nContextualising the bias which she strongly believes was shown to women by NASS, Sonaiya said: \u201cI was actually thinking that we have been talking about bad treatment meted out to Nigerian citizens in Ukraine, the racism against them in that they were not allowed to board buses in the wake of the Russian invasion to get to the border of Poland. When such things happened members of the National Assembly were angry, saying they could not tolerate that kind of treatment. But what they did against the women is it not the same thing? Is it not the same act of discrimination; is it not the same refusal to recognize the humanness? They are practicing the same thing: gender discrimination and gender bias.\u201d\n\nDealing with bias\n\nVice Chairperson, Commonwealth Businesses Women Network and Chief Executive/Boardchair, Strategic Women and Youth Institute (SWYI), Mrs Ngozi Oyewole, is one resourceful female person that has mastered the art of confronting and overcoming barriers placed in her way.\n\nShe said: \u201cAs an entrepreneur I am always happy to tell my story and the barriers I face every time, and how I overcome them. Like they say your story is your strength and be shameless about the hustle.\n\n\u201cOffice furniture manufacturing is thought to be a male-dominated industry, but I thrive very well and pounding the ground even harder than the men. What I face is a Catch-22 situation sometimes, where some are biased and display stereotyped behaviour and the implicit association with the entrepreneur\u2019s business competency, especially when they say \u2018don\u2019t pitch like a girl\u2019 \u2013 this driven by stereotypes based on gender role expectations for men and women. In my case, a woman entrepreneur playing in a male dominated area such as mine, is considered overly assertive, viewed negatively, and will experience career backlash.\n\n\u201cSo, women entrepreneurs who disrupt gender norms by adopting masculine-stereotyped behaviour are likely to lose approval and be negatively perceived by others. This then creates roadblocks for them. This is very common when seeking growth capital, where the women suffer from investor perceptions as a female entrepreneur instead of looking into their preferences for the venture.\n\n\u201cSo, women experience a greater difficulty in obtaining funding for their businesses because the investors perceive women-led businesses as less legitimate, riskier and competency deficient. Because of these discriminatory practices women entrepreneurs face, a lot of women are discouraged and cannot even take off from ground zero.\n\n\u201cIn the early stages of my entrepreneurial journey where I had to pitch for funds for my business, I was poorly served because I was perceived as inferior to men in terms of having the necessary abilities to lead a business, because I was expected to display communal traits to fulfill my female gender role as a nurturer, which is in contrast to the leadership role\u2019s requirement for energetic traits.\n\n\u201cI sat back and looked inwards, got myself well equipped to face the battle and realized that gender bias cannot be killed by fire, but by knowledge! I embarked on self-development, got myself a coach, grew my confidence, expanded my knowledge, through networking by joining social organizations, increased my net-worth and today here I am.\u201d\n\nOn the way forward, to achieve the desire of women in the Nigerian polity, Sonaiya counselled that the womenfolk need the cooperation of the men, to attain the increase in the number of women participating in politics.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t give up,\u201d she said with dogged confidence of a fighter.",

          "text": "\n\n*Says Lagos Free Zone to decongest Apapa,Tincan Island ports\n\n*Insists CBN ready to support investors\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has promised to engage the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria Limited (InfraCo), relevant agencies of the federal and Lagos State governments, as well as the private sector for the development of road infrastructure in the Lagos Free Zone to support the growing industrial activities at the Lekki-Epe axis.\n\n\n\nHe said this became expedient given the growth of industries in and around the Free Trade Zone, notably, Dangote Refineries and Tolaram Group, which have attracted economic activities and created heavy traffic in the area.\n\nEmefiele spoke yesterday, during a tour of Tolaram Group\u2019s industries, which occupied 850,000 acres of land with industrial investment pegged at $2.1 billion within the Lagos Free Zone.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, InfraCo, in aiding the road construction, would decongest the environs of the Lagos Free Zone with the active collaboration with the federal and Lagos State governments.\n\nSpecifically, he said the commencement of the Lagos Free Zone will help overcome the Apapa-Tincan Island port congestion.\n\n\n\nEmefiele also said that the apex bank would partner the federal and state governments to see how InfraCo could ensure cargo evacuation from the port area, describing it as a big issue.\n\nHe said the CBN had raised about N23 billion to fund road infrastructure, to facilitate smooth evacuation of cargo out of the port.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe entire idea is that with this Lagos Free Zone Port, we should be able to see a total decongestion of Apapa and Tin Can Island Port purely from the standpoint that it would take the traffic away from Apapa.\n\n\u201cAnd we are also afraid that with the single road that we have, which is the Lagos-Epe-Lekki road, which is already congested with traffic, the situation is going to worsen, even with Dangote Refinery. Yes, it is something that we are seeing and I, coming here today and I\u2019ve been to Dangote Refinery several times and I know how long it takes to drive by road.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, what I\u2019m trying to say is that we have realised the problem. InfraCo, luckily, is chaired by the CBN; the InfraCo board has been formally constituted; there is a CEO in InfraCo and as soon as we leave this meeting, I will be calling on InfraCo to begin the engagement. I will also be involved in engaging the Lagos state government, as well as the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Works to see what can be done on evacuating out of Lagos, but also how we decongest the traffic for people living around this axis.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to give assurance that this is something that would be dealt with. This would be middle to a long-term plan,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CBN governor encouraged entrepreneurs and business owners to key into apex bank\u2019s various interventions, stating that the CBN was keen on promoting industrialisation with long-term single-digit loans.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor any entrepreneur that wishes to do business in Nigeria we will provide both Naira funding and will always advise that particularly if your revenue stream is in naira, I will not advise taking dollar loans. Take cheap Naira loans at single-digit interest rates with two years moratorium. I don\u2019t think that you would ever find this again. I always encourage people to take advantage of it because it\u2019s available as we want to drive industrialisation in Nigeria and get a manufacturing business back alive again.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would support not only the Tolaram Group or the Dangote\u2019s or the BUAs; once you mean well and you want to do business in Nigeria, we would give you all the support you need,\u201d he explained.\n\nEmefiele noted that the Tolaram Group had made immediate plans to evacuate their products through the port to Ikorodu, Festac, and Warri to trucks, which for the immediate time don\u2019t have road congestion impact. According to him, road expansion is a much-needed investment that would also aid export.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are happy that this port infrastructure is here, it would have to deal with our problem of ease of doing business. Part of our problems about ease of doing business or in this case, ease of export, is that we find Nigerians want to export, they can export their goods out of Lagos Tin Can or Lagos Apapa port. People prefer to drive by road to transport their products and goods to neighbouring countries and ship them out of those countries and the implication is that Nigeria loses the benefit of being called exported from Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe with this port and we are going to be engaging them, I\u2019m happy the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority are involved; we would seek to also work with the Lagos Free Zone by having a dedicated export desk that would make it easy for goods to be exported out of this port. That is a very essential thing that we need to deal with because again, talking in a very selfish mode, we need foreign exchange. If we export, we earn foreign exchange, and I am going to start working with them to ensure that we designate the Lagos Free Zone as an export zone,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOn how much CBN has supported the group, Emefiele said: \u201cCertainly, over N100 billion has gone from CBN intervention under CRR or through agriculture credit route to the Tolaram Group. Don\u2019t forget that this project is about $2 billion, which is about N1 trillion, and N100 billion is just 10 per cent. So, we have sowed a seed as well. At least N1 trillion has gone into this project and we have done about N100 billion, which is just around 10 per cent,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nThe CBN governor further said that the bank would ensure it did everything possible to make the environment friendly for companies and businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re looking into how to make sure that the policy regulations are reviewed; we have our concerns about how free trade zones operate either tax exemptions or duty free exemptions and the rest of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would like to work with you to see how we would create a clear demarcation that separates companies that operate as free trade zones or operating in free trade zone from those that will not operate as free trade zone.\n\n\u201cWhereas you will also find that a company may want to operate as a free trade zone and at the same time operate the other way. So, we need to demarcate how this will work, such that it will not result in loss of revenue,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "But oil multinational sold all its shares, not JV assets to Seplat\n\nNOC\u2019s action opens up possible legal tussle\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited may have created a wedge in the highly acclaimed transaction that would have seen Seplat Energy, an indigenous oil firm, buy over oil shares belonging to ExxonMobil, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe deal between ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian unit, Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in August last year, had attracted plaudits from industry leaders.\n\nThe Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, THISDAY had reported, was for a purchase price of $1.283 billion, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt from officials NNPC, that the state-owned oil giant has opted to exercise its Right of First Refusal (RFR) on the sale of the assets.\n\nThe RFR is reportedly contained in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) of the Joint Venture (JV), which represents NNPC\u2019s position on the planned sale of the shares to Seplat Energy Plc.\n\nEfforts to get NNPC to speak on the matter were not immediately fruitful, but a top source in the oil firm told THISDAY, \u201cWe will address it at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBut an industry source who preferred to remain anonymous said last night that NNPC\u2019s action could lead to legal tussle between Seplat and the national oil company. The source stressed that NNPC did not have the power to halt the acquisition of the multinational oil company\u2019s shares by Seplat.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cSeplat bought ExxonMobil\u2019s shares, not assets. Whereas NNPC has right of pre-emption over the sale of assets, it does not have right over sale of shares.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the source explained that with its present structure, NNPC was now a commercial entity and no longer a regulator, as it used to be in the past, \u201cso, it is the regulator that can interfere in the matter.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cHowever, they have to check the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) because if they say they are taking over ExxonMobil, that means they are taking over staff, pensions and liabilities and not assets.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that NNPC had already notified Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited of its intention to exercise the right of pre-emption on ExxonMobil\u2019s planned sale of its entire asset in Nigeria\u2019s onshore and shallow waters.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that the politics underlying the stoppage of the deal could markedly derail the new verve the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was expected to bring to the industry.\n\nIt was learnt that NNPC was intending to have a special arrangement with a company belonging to a northerner operating in the oil and gas industry, under a \u201cstrategic management contract.\u201d\n\nIndustry sources said that the state-owned oil firm, which is the major shareholder in the JV with ExxonMobil, might have exercised its right of first refusal on the assets as part of a new era, which will focus solely on building the long-term profitability of the NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Mele Kyari-led company had previously conveyed its decision to exercise its rights and match any offer by interested parties for the assets following ExxonMobil\u2019s decision to receive bids for their share of the JV, the platform reported.\n\nSeplat Energy subsequently put forward a winning bid for the assets and reached an agreement with ExxonMobil.\n\nRight of pre-emption is a legal right to parties in a joint venture to be the first to be considered for any planned sale or takeover of assets in the JVs if either party choose to trade them off.\n\nA letter signed by the Group Managing Director, Kyari, and addressed to ExxonMobil, quoted NNPC as reiterating its resolve to take over the company\u2019s share of the assets.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that you reached an agreement to divest from onshore and shallow waters JVs,\u201d the letter read, adding, \u201cClearly we are interested.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the agreement, ExxonMobil had earlier said that the deals were subject to approval and the new position of NNPC, meaning that the whole process of sale and purchase agreement between ExxonMobil and Seplat Energy has to be discontinued.\n\nSeplat Energy, the company that made the winning bid, had staked over $1.2 billion for the deal to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU plus contingent consideration and was waiting for the minister\u2019s consent before the latest development.\n\nThis meant that the state-owned oil firm must not, based on its exercise of right of first refusal, pay below the $1.2 billion mark.\n\nAccording to the letter, NNPC also reiterated that it had already transformed from being a corporation to being a profit driven company and it now had the capacity to buy over the share of ExxonMobil in the Joint venture.\n\nThe NNPC had recently announced a funding agreement with Afreximbank for up to $5 billion to grow its investment in new and existing upstream assets.\n\nRecently, the publishers of Africa Oil and Gas Report raised the alarm over the attempt by the national oil company to crowd out private investors, saying that enough space should be created for some level of diversity in investment. That alarm has now proved to be a wakeup call on increasingly seemingly grab all posture.\n\nCommenting on the pre-emption rights as expressed by NNPC, Publisher of the magazine, Toyin Akinosho, who had spoken on Arise News Channel, urged NNPC to free the space for entrepreneurs to come in, insisting that the company already has a lot in its basket and was even finding it difficult to cope.\n\nAkinosho maintained, \u201cNNPC is in JV with companies that produce at least 45 per cent of our crude. That\u2019s a lot of material for them already. The assets they operate are the least optimised of all the assets in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhile accusing NNPC of grabbing assets all over the country, he wondered why the national oil company was allegedly stifling investment in the sector. According to him, the kind of partners that NNPC may hand over the assets to are always not the most experienced in the space, adding that the whole idea is \u201cgift\u201d it to a third party.\n\n\u201cIt would not manage the assets, so any excuse about \u2018this being taken over in the interest of the state\u2019 is untrue. In the last three years, it has implemented Finance and Technical Service Agreements (FTSAs), with companies that it chooses to work the assets,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*NDLEA to arraign suspended \u2018super cop,\u2019 four IRT members on eight counts of drug trafficking\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has commenced moves to extradite the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to the United States of America to face fraud allegations.\n\nFew hours after the extradition process commenced, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), which currently has Kyari in its custody following his arrest for alleged illicit drug dealing, also initiated a court process against him. By this development, Kyari, four of his colleagues in the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team (IRT), and two others would be arraigned any moment on drug-related charges.\n\nNDLEA filed an eight-count criminal charge against the defendants at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe implication of the NDLEA court action against Kyari is that he cannot be extradited to the US, even though the federal government has commenced the extradition process.\n\nSection 3 (f) of the Extradition Act says, \u201cA fugitive criminal- (a) who has been charged with an offence under the law of Nigeria or any part thereof, not being the offence for which his surrender is sought; or (b) who is serving a sentence imposed in respect of any such offence by a court in Nigeria, shall not be surrendered until such a time as he has been discharged whether by acquittal or on the expiration of his sentence or otherwise.\u201d\n\nKyari, a once celebrated officer of the Nigeria Police, is currently enmeshed in various criminal allegations in connection with cases for which the \u201csuper cop\u201d had previously won accolades for fighting.\n\nFollowing the arrest and imprisonment of Abass Ramon, a.k.a Hushpuppi, over a $1.1 million wire fraud and Ramon\u2019s alleged implication of Kyari, who was then Commander of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), the United States had requested the extradition of Kyari to explain his alleged involvement in the crime.\n\nMonths after the extradition request, yesterday, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), disclosed that the federal government had filed an application for the extradition of Kyari before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Malami stated that the application, which followed a request by the diplomatic representative of the American embassy in Abuja, was filed under the Extradition Act and marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022.\n\nOnly recently, the AGF, while speaking during a television programme, assured that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration would extradite Kyari to the US to answer to the fraud charge filed against him, Hushpuppi, and four others if the government felt convinced to do so.\n\nSpeaking on the extradition application, the minister said it was \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Kyari, who is a subject in a superseding three counts indictment.\u201d He said the offence for which Kyari\u2019s extradition was being made was not political or trivial.\n\nMalami added that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nThe minister stated that if surrendered, Kyari would not be victimised at his trial and will not be punished, detained or have his personal liberty restricted due to race, nationality or political opinions.\u201d\n\nMalami explained that having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it would not be unjust or oppressive, or too severe a punishment, to surrender him. He noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence.\n\nNDLEA to Arraign Kyari, Four IRT Members on Eight-count Drug Charge\n\nThe federal government would any time from now arraign Kyari, four of his colleagues in the IRT, and two others on drug related offences.\n\nKyari and his co-accused were arrested on February 14 and handed over to the police for investigation over allegations bordering on illicit drug dealing.\n\nThe charge, filed yesterday and marked FHC/ABJ/CR/57/2022, was signed by NDLEA\u2019s Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Mr. Joseph Sunday.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s suit, the anti-drug agency had obtained a court order to detain Kyari and others for another 14 days to enable it conclude its investigation and then charge them to court.\n\nOthers listed in the charge included Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirigba; Inspector John Nuhu; Chibuinna Patrick Umeibe; and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne.\n\nIn count one, Kyari, ACP Ubua, ASP James, Inspector Agirigba, and Inspector Nuhu, all of Intelligence Response Team were said to have between January 19 and 25, dealt in 17. 55 kilogrammes of cocaine and committed and offence contrary to and punishable under section 14 (b) of the Natural Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act, CAP 30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nCount one read, \u201cThat you DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday J.

          "text": "*EU observer mission meets parties, stakeholders ahead of next year\u2019s polls\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, dashed the hope and plans of many people, when it declared it would not register any new political parties, because they would not be able to participate in the 2023 general election by law.\n\nINEC, which claimed that the reason was because the new Electoral Act barred the registration of new political parties to participate in any general election twelve months before, added also that the same new electoral law, allowed for the merger of political parties, only nine months to the general elections.\n\nThere are currently 18 registered political parties in the country.\n\nHowever, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, called on INEC to be truly independent in the conduct of subsequent elections and not allow itself to be manipulated as was the case in 2019, which its National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, claimed the opposition party won but was denied.\n\nThe PDP also called on all security agencies not to allow themselves to be used to subvert electoral processes as was done during the Federal Capital Territory and other elections in Imo and Plateau States recently.\n\nAt the same time, the European Union (EU) Election Observation Follow-up Mission, led by the Head of EU Observation Mission, Mrs Maria Arena, yesterday, hinted that it has held talks with political parties and other stakeholders ahead of next elections and would give a report of its meetings soon.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting organised by the Nigeria Guild of Editors, INEC national commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman Voters Education, Festus Okoye, reiterated that, \u201cThe Act also provides that new political association must apply for registration not later than 12 months before a general election while applications for merger must be filed not later than 9 months before election.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that registration and their participation were already time barred, Okoye said, INEC has already released the timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election, fixing Presidential and National Assembly elections to hold on the 25th of February 2023 and Governorship and State Assembly Elections to hold on the 11th of March 2023.\n\nHe said the law provided that the election funds due to the Commission for any general elections were to be released to the Commission not later than one year before the election.\n\nOkoye explained that Nigeria was entering a critical and challenging phase in its electoral process as there were new, creative and progressive provisions and innovations in the new law, adding: \u201cThe law has tight timelines that must be carefully managed.\n\nUnder the new law, the Commission shall issue the Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the date fixed for the conduct of elections. Political parties must submit the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates not later than 180 days before the election.\u201d\n\nThe INEC national commissioner said the new law contained such new provisions relating to ballot boxes and voting devices, accreditation of voters, determination of over-voting, visually impaired and incapacitated voters, post-election procedure and collation of election results.\n\nAccording to Okoye, \u201cIt also contains power of the Commission to review declared results, nomination of candidates, limitation of election expenses and the jurisdiction of courts in pre-election matters among other provisions.\u201d\n\nHe called on the media to isolate and analyse these provisions and thereafter treat the entire law as a compound package for the conduct of elections in Nigeria.\n\nAccordingly, he said a good knowledge of the law and its provisions would assist in crafting good editorials and holding the Commission and the Political Parties accountable to their implementation.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe 2023 general election will come with challenges and the Commission is determined to surmount these challenges and conduct free, fair, credible and inclusive election. Growing insecurity in several parts of the country and the increasing number of internally displaced persons will pose challenges to the conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cSo many of the internally displaced persons are in the houses of friends and relatives and have lost their Permanent Voters Cards and it is next to impossibility to recreate their constituencies and polling units.\n\n\u201cThis is because section 47(1) of the Electoral Act clearly provides that a person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter\u2019s card to a Presiding Officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\n\n\u201cSome of these persons are no longer in their constituencies and can no longer access their polling units and so many of them have lost their Permanent Voters Cards. While it is easy to recreate constituencies and polling units in clustered camps of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP camps), it is next to impossibility to do so for persons staying in scattered locations,\u201d he stated\n\nIn view of this, Okoye said, \u201cFor the internally displaced, the Commission will print new Permanent Voters Cards for them and recreate their polling units in their camps and they will be eligible to vote in some of the elections depending on their location and their proximity to their State and Federal Constituencies.\n\n\u201cThis is in accord with section 24(1) of the Electoral Act, which provides that, \u2018In the event of an emergency affecting an election, the Commission shall, as far as practicable, ensure that persons displaced as a result of the emergency are not disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cBased on this, the Commission developed regulations and guidelines on IDP voting and will implement the intendment of the law and the Regulations and Guidelines,\u201d he disclosed\n\nOkoye hinted that the Commission was currently at the terminal phase of its Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR), as there were so many communities that were still inaccessible to INEC registration officers.\n\nHis words: \u201cIn the next few weeks, the Commission will roll out modalities for the further devolution and rotation of the CVR to our registration areas and the security of our personnel and the registrants are fundamental to the success of the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to register all eligible registrants but will not expose our staff to unnecessary danger. We will roll out and roll back depending on the security situation in different parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe stated said that it was important for the media to continue to highlight and analyse the causes and possible solutions to the security challenges in the country and continue to hold government accountable.\n\nHe equally explained that the various security agencies must try as much as possible to degrade if not neutralise the security threats and challenges in different parts of the country, adding that voting and the exercise of democratic mandate might not be the priority of persons enveloped in a climate and atmosphere of fear and anxiety.\n\nOn the innovations in the Commission, he said. \u201cAs some of you are aware, the Commission has introduced new and creative changes in the enumeration of voters, the party nomination processes and the conduct of elections. The Commission is currently conducting the Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR) both physically and online using the new INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has introduced an online nomination portal through which Political Parties upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates. The Commission has also introduced an online portal through which international and domestic observers and the media apply for accreditation.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for voter accreditation and authentication. The Commission introduced the INEC Result Viewing Portal (iRev) through which polling unit level results are uploaded to a result-viewing portal in real time.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is firmly of the view that greater use of technology in the electoral process will, to a large extent, reduce human interference in the voting, counting and collation process.\u201d\n\nHowever, Okoye said the Commission was conscious of the fact that technology did not operate itself and that the human element is ever present, but added, that the Commission would continue to learn from issues and challenges that arise from the deployment of technology as well as innovate and improve on them.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayu, who spoke yesterday when the EU Observation Mission visited, maintained that the party had evidence that security agencies were used to subvert the electoral processes in the recent bye-election in some states, while charging its members to henceforth rise up and defend their votes.\n\nSpeaking at the PDP national secretariat, Ayu charged INEC to be genuinely independent to enable democracy to thrive in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP was not making flimsy excuses of the security agencies being used to subvert the electoral processes, adding, \u201cWe have the hard core evidence and we have submitted same to INEC.\u201d\n\nHe said the PDP would mobilise and sensitise the voters as well as asked them to defend their votes when the need arises\n\n\u201cWe have seen a decline in those things, which were promoted as a political party, including the establishments or creating of certain institutions that will strengthen democracy in this country. And, therefore, we are very worried that those, instead of strengthening the democratic process, which will see democracy sustained, we see a sustained decline in those democratic practices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe identified such things like the conduct of elections, use of security services to attack judges, to attack citizens, instead of protecting them to survive the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence; I will stand by our position. We are happy that these are not just empty pronouncements, even you. You have shown to me in 2019 report, which you have read \u2013 shows clearly some of those problems that we\u2019re complaining \u2013 we\u2019ll keep complaining as long as these practices are sustained,\u201d Ayu stated .\n\nThe PDP National Chairman explained that the party had evidence that it won the 2019 general election, and lamented that justice was not done.\n\nAccording to him, it would not be good to allow such injustice to continue as was the case in the last FCT elections, where it was awarded three local governments of Abuja Municipal Area, Kuje and Bwari area councils, whereas it won 44 councillors and the APC won only 18 councillors.\n\nHe insisted that the electoral processes were subverted, because Abaji, Kwali and Gwagwalada area councils were in the rural areas of the FCT\n\nThe Head, EU Observation Mission, Arena, said the mission had been in the country meeting political parties, stakeholders and media in the last five days and would make its findings known to the public soon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina says Nigerians will survive the current fuel scarcity.\n\nNigerians have been battling with fuel scarcity since February.\n\nFemi Adesina\n\nThe scarcity is said to have been caused by the importation of adulterated fuel.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government had assured Nigerians that normalcy would soon return because it has enough fuel.\n\nAdesina in his latest weekly article on Thursday titled \u201cKNOCK, KNOCK. WHO\u2019S THERE?\u201d said that there were cases of bad fuel before in Nigeria and Nigerians survived.\n\nHe said, \u201cYet some other people have children, wards, dependents, relations in Ukraine, currently being bombarded by Russia. I have one, daughter of a family friend. When I spoke with her last week, she was hiding in a bunker, talking in whispers. But amidst it all, no fuel, no electricity, anxiety about Ukraine, general insecurity, Government continues to work.\n\n\u201cThe Heavens won\u2019t fall, and sanity would be restored. The current situation is called SNAFU: Situation Normal All Fouled Up. Normalcy will definitely return. \u201cBe patient, my soul. Thou hath suffered worse than this.\u201d (Thomas Holcroft). \u201cWhy are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him for the salvation of His presence.\u201d Psalm 42:5.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu has promptly approved the sum of $8.5m for the evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine. Good. That\u2019s what a responsible father does to family members in distress. He\u2019s also working night and day, ensuring the country has fuel, power, infrastructure, and all the good things of life. Be patient my soul...\n\n\u201cKnock, Knock, Who\u2019s there? Yes, do you remember the title of that book by James Hadley Chase that we read in the 70s and 80s? Were you old enough then? Do you also remember the song we used to listen and dance to then? Written by Aaron Schroeder and Sid Wayne, released in 1959 by Isley Brothers, and it became a global hit. Were you old enough then?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell Tap on your window too,\n\nIf you don\u2019t come out tonight when the moon is bright. I\u2019m gonna knock and ring and tap until you do.\u201d Are you like King Lear at his gloomy worst? I\u2019ve come to knock on your door. Are you saturnine and lugubrious \u2018cos there\u2019s no fuel, no light, no power? \u201cDem go reach bed power no dey, shuffering and shmiling ,\u201d Fela Anikulapo-Kuti had sang long ago. \u201cBe patient my soul, thou hath suffered worse than this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were cases of bad fuel before in this country. We slept for days, weeks on end at petrol stations, queuing for fuel. We survived. We will survive again. Las las.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to knock and ring and tap on your door today, to remind you that it is not all doom and gloom in our country. However overcast the sky is, there\u2019s always a shimmer of light. And that was what we were shown a couple of weeks back, when the Minister of Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, accompanied by Works and Housing Minister, Babatunde Raji Fashola SAN, and their other counterparts addressed a town hall meeting on infrastructure financing and human capital development. It was like streaks of light in an overcast sky.\u201d",

After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely. People are already spending $1,000 on an iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nDaodu noted that Vault Hill is not building an escapism platform, but intentionally thinking about how humans do things in the real world and then creating a way to augment it virtually\u2014with an ultimate aim of fostering human interaction. For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years and 3 million rides later, can SafeBoda keep its lead in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Duroshola, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as CEO. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Duroshola\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 2 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying that only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I asked because it has become a catchword in a country with over 56 million unbanked adults.\n\nFinancially included individuals have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit, and insurance. Also, a higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could result in a poorer population because a lack of access to credit and insurance places them at a competitive economic disadvantage.\n\nThe Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), shows that Nigeria has one of the highest rates of financial exclusion in Africa at 35.9%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, given the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) goal to increase that figure to 94% by 2024, there is still much work to be done. And recently, the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has joined the fray.\n\nNIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, in January 2022. The platform includes a free debit card that can be used both offline and online, and it is available at all NIPOST locations in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nThe agency banking platform, according to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, would conform to the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) financial inclusion standards. He also stated that this is a part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise postal services and increase financial inclusion in the country.\n\nWhat is the plan? How do they intend to achieve this? You can catch up with this here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow to improve customer experience\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\nSudo Africa\u2019s $3.7 million pre-seed\n\nChari\u2019s new acquisition\n\nImproving customer experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most memorable customer service experience you\u2019ve had? It could be a good or a bad one, but trust me when I say that the bad ones outnumber the good ones, at least for me.\n\nThe most recent experience I had was on Wednesday. I wanted to buy plantain, so I inquired about the price due to its size. \u201cOmo,\u201d I said after hearing the price. \u201cThese plantains aren\u2019t good for this price\u2026\u201d I wasn\u2019t even done when the vendor cut me short, saying, \u201cGo and buy it elsewhere if it\u2019s too small.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not surprised, right? What exactly did I say to deserve that? I was indirectly expressing my dismay about the country\u2019s economic situation, and she responded in that manner? I didn\u2019t even think twice; I left for somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might not have experienced this with roadside vendors, but you may have had similar dealings with telcos, retailers, or big corporations, ranging from a long wait time to being treated rudely or simply haven\u2019t been shown empathy.\n\nCustomer experience \u2013 the feeling or memory that a customer or prospective customer has whenever they come in contact with a business \u2013 is dependent on a company\u2019s customer service.\n\nSo, how can customer experience be enhanced? Apart from demonstrating empathy or helping employees understand customers aren\u2019t angry or frustrated with them, but with the product or service, you can use tools to help improve this experience. And that is exactly what MyServiceAgent does for businesses.\n\nMyServiceAgent is a technology company offering a variety of tools to businesses to improve the customer experience. Chimgozirim walks us through what they do and how the company uses AI to help companies to improve their customer experience.\n\nPlease read it here: Built in response to COVID-19, MyServiceAgent now helps businesses improve customer experience with AI\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no news that African telecom, MTN, has joined the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Shopify in betting big on the metaverse by purchasing 144 plots of land in Africarare, South Africa\u2019s first metaverse.\n\nWhat exactly is the Metaverse? The concept of a metaverse is not new. It was first described in the novel Snow Crash, published in 1992. Several companies later created online communities based on the concept, the most notable was Second Life, which debuted in 2003.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, it is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the metaverse is a shared virtual world that people can access via the Internet. In other words, it is a virtual world in which people can live, work, shop, and interact with others from the comfort of their room in the real world.\n\nIn the metaverse, technologies VR and AR are combined to create a sense of \u201cvirtual presence.\u201d\n\nAlso, the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d did not become popular until Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta in October 2021. At the time, the company announced plans to invest $10 billion over the next year to realise its vision of the metaverse.\n\nThe big question is, why did MTN decide to join the Metaverse? Is it to follow a trend, improve customers\u2019 digital experiences, or what?

Approximately 50,000 merchants use the platform for credit and bookkeeping services. It allows these businesses to manage the credit they extend to their customers.\n\nYesterday, the company announced that it had acquired Axa Credit, the credit branch of Axa Assurance Maroc, for $22 million.\n\nWhat does Chari do? Chari is a mobile app that allows small retailers in Morocco and Tunisia to order products from Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) multinationals and local manufacturers and receive them in less than 24 hours. It was founded in 2020 by Ismael Belkhayat (CEO) and Sophia Alj (Co-founder).\n\nThe acquisition of Axa Credit will provide Chari with the credit licence required to begin lending to its FMCG B2B clients, who will then lend money to their consumer clients.\n\nChari believes that shop owners understand their customers\u2019 spending habits, where they live, and when and how they are paid, and thus can perform the credit risk assessment that a traditional bank cannot.\n\nThe company intends to charge merchants a setup fee and low-interest rates as it gains more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow to Make \u2018Friends\u2019 with Anxiety: A Simple Technique to Gain Perspective.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fintech space, phrases like \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d have become so prevalent that they\u2019ve almost certainly become buzzwords. Sometimes, it appears that a fintech startup claiming to be the latest saviour is born every second.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the proliferation of fintech startups in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem and the largely unsolved problem of the unbanked. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa.\n\nThat leaves almost 54% unbanked. Considering the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) plan to increase that number to 94% by 2024, there\u2019s still quite a bit to be done. And the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has recently thrown its hat in this ring.\n\nIn January 2022, NIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The platform comes with a free debit card that works offline and online and is available at all NIPOST outlets in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the agency banking platform would follow the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) standards on financial inclusion. He also said that this is part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise the postal services and improve financial inclusion in the country.\n\nHow would this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy UPU standards, NIPOST\u2019s agency banking platform should provide essential services like savings, payments, money transfers, insurance, and credit. However, it appears the platform would work much like a multi-teller PoS-based service, so the exact mechanics of how NIPOST hopes to serve its customers are a bit sketchy.\n\nTechpoint Africa sent a mail to the Postmaster General\u2019s office but received no reply and a visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that not much is known about the platform yet other than its March expected launch date.\n\nHowever, NIPOST is licensed by the CBN as a super agent and, by CBN guidelines, cannot provide insurance or credit facilities.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the free debit card would use biometric authentication.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa-based fintech, Paycode, provides biometric debit cards, which the company says are operational in several countries, including Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique. In Namibia, Paycode works with the Namibia Post Ltd (NamPost).\n\nA biometric debit card uses the owner\u2019s fingerprints to authenticate transactions, ensuring additional security and ease of use by the uneducated, thus making it suitable for financial inclusion, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis also means the card can be used offline. For example, Paycode says anyone with access to its API can verify users biometrically without connecting to the Internet. ExtoLabs, a California-based software company with plans to launch in Africa, uses a Bluetooth connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unknown player\n\nInterestingly, NIPOST did not mention a partnership with any fintech company to deliver this card. However, pictures of the ceremony in Abuja reveal a name \u2014 GingrPay \u2014 etched on the demo cards.\n\nA Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) search uncovered a company named GingrPay Nigeria Limited incorporated on May 18, 2021. A Google search led to a third party website with more info like directors, shareholders, persons with significant control, and companies where GingrPay company officers show up as directors or shareholders.\n\nThe website cites GingrPay\u2019s activity description as \u201cTo facilitate electronic circulation of money as well as the exchange of value between individuals and organisations on a timely and consistent basis using technological softwares.\u201d\n\nA search on the CBN website does not turn up any licence registered to the company name.\n\nVisiting other nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, postal services are no strangers to providing financial services. In Brazil, Correios, the state-owned postal company, operates the Banco Postal in partnership with Banco do Brasil, providing banking services to the unbanked.\n\nIn India, the India Post Payments Bank is a subsidiary of the India Post and has been in operation since September 2018, serving over four crore \u2014 40 million \u2014 customers. Initially, because the India Post appeared to be haemorrhaging money, there was some resistance to the initiative.\n\nOn the continent, in Ghana, the Ghana Post provides various financial services like agency banking in partnership with banks, insurance, and GhPostPay, which enables users to make online transactions. Remittance services are currently suspended.\n\nIn the Benin Republic, government-owned Le poste du B\u00e9nin enables customers to have both savings and current accounts, and provides credit facilities, insurance, and remittance.\n\nNamibia\u2019s NamPost gives customers access to a funeral cover and a savings bank that provides investment products, and save-as-you-earn accounts, among other things.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, postal services are used by significantly poorer persons, older, less educated, and people less likely to be employed than those who have an account at a financial institution or both a financial institution and the post office.\n\nLogically, it follows that postal institutions are essential to fostering financial inclusion.\n\nThe financial inclusion play\n\nNIPOST has made several attempts in this arena.\n\nIn 2017, it signed a partnership agreement with Nigerian fintech startup, Paga, to improve financial inclusion.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Arike Okunowo, General Manager, Sales and Distribution, explained that the partnership broke down after a few months because there were some issues surrounding the staffing needed to successfully run the business.\n\nThe partnership saw Paga provide the platform, which NIPOST\u2019s workers manned. But Okunowo explained that the staff already had primary assignments and this created conflict.\n\nAs she told Techpoint Africa, \u201cIf you want to run financial services, you need some level of focus so that if the customer comes in, you are always available to attend to them.\u201d\n\nShe also said that NIPOST was very keen on having its staff man the platform with no third-party interference. However, she also said that they would be open to a possible partnership with the postal company in the future.\n\nOn its financial services page, the postal service company says it provides domestic transfers, international remittance, agency banking \u2013 this appears to have been on the page since April 23, 2021 \u2013 and mobile money services.\n\nNIPOST owns an International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) licence and says it has partnered with companies like Western Union.\n\nA visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that the agency no longer carries out any of these services and doesn\u2019t seem to have done so for a while, an offshoot of Pantami\u2019s decision in 2019, which saw the agency adopt a cashless policy. All cash transactions, including remittance, are to be done in a banking hall.\n\nThere are also plans to create a microfinance bank.\n\nWhat industry players are saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkunowo believed NIPOST\u2019s infrastructure makes it a good centrepoint as a shared resource.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say NIPOST should actually be a shared resource for all the providers because of its infrastructure, and because it\u2019s such a major part of the Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nWhile Edidiong Uwemakpan, Director, Brand and Corporate Communications, TeamApt, believed the decision is commendable, she worried about fraud.\n\n\u201cWhere I begin to find challenges is that you were trying to eliminate cash. Now, part of agency banking is, of course, bill payments, and that makes sense. But then the cash in, cash out part of things, that\u2019s where I don\u2019t really see how they plan to do it.\n\n\u201cBecause, are you going to be giving your NIPOST workers a float so that they can give people cash? And you were already trying to eliminate cash in the past because of fraud.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that NIPOST appears not to have partnered with well-known fintechs. And while Okunowo could not confirm if NIPOST had approached Paga, Uwemakpan said TeamApt did not receive any communication from the postal agency.\n\nHowever, though Uwemakpan believed that the market is big enough to contain everyone, she raises concerns regarding the number of outlets NIPOST has \u2013 3,000 \u2013 and whether this would be enough to serve customers. She said NIPOST might need to expand its reach to compete.\n\nOne thing Okunowo and Uwemakpan agreed on is that this endeavour requires quite a lot of investment by NIPOST.\n\nA digital economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced a three-year modernisation plan for NIPOST. By 2020, the postal agency was to have been unbundled into six subsidiaries: NIPOST Banking and Insurance Company; NIPOST Property and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Services Company; NIPOST E-government Services Company; and NIPOST E-commerce Services Company.\n\nIn January 2022, speaking at a media parley held in Abuja, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Postmaster General and CEO of NIPOST, said that NIPOST was to be unbundled once more, this time, in three places: NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nHe also said the unbundling would be done before the end of January 2022. However, there has been no announcement to that effect.\n\nThe NIPOST Act is still in the process of being repealed, and the Nigerian Postal Service (Repeal and Reenactment) Act 2021, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives in 2021, is currently awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen assented to, this means that NIPOST can be unbundled into whatever subsidiaries it sees fit and would hold regulatory powers, making the Postal Agency a Commission.\n\nNIPOST has also partnered with several private companies on its path to full digitisation. In December 2021, it announced an agreement with Egyptian startup, eGATE to create an app that automates last-mile delivery. Customers will be able to track communication with drivers and monitor their delivery.\n\nIn 2018, NIPOST introduced its Address Verification System and Digital Address System. Both were done in collaboration with identity verification startup, Youverify, to improve mail delivery and resolve addressing issues, but the link to the website leads to a dummy page.\n\nHowever, interestingly, there are plans to launch a digital postal code system that is expected to solve the same problem before the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface level, NIPOST does seem to have a lot planned that should benefit the average citizen, but implementation and consistency appear to be lacking.\n\nTo pull off its latest scheme, it might require an overhaul of its entire processes \u2013 like its unbundling, for instance. But these are still early days, and there is much that can still happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "5 Uncompleted Nigerian projects that gulped millions of dollars",
          "text": "Nigeria, one of the biggest countries in Africa, has a lot of long-running million-dollar projects with barely any impact on its citizens while accruing debts. Some of these projects, when they are eventually completed, are clearly overpriced.\n\nHere are five examples of such projects along with the millions they have gulped:\n\nNational Library\n\nCost: N18 billion\n\nYear: 2006\n\nCurrent status: unfinished\n\nSituated on Plot 35 in the Central Business District, Abuja, the National Library of Nigeria headquarters building has become a dream deferred.\n\nThe contract for the building was awarded in 2006 to Messes Reynolds Construction Company (RCC) at the cost of N8.590bn, but construction was stalled because of the government\u2019s inability to fund the contract. In 2008, the contractor demanded an upward review of the amount.\n\nThe Ministry of Education later reviewed the design of the property, leading to the upward review of the project to N18bn in 2009 following approval by the Federal Executive Council (FEC), with a completion period of 21 months effective from July, 2010.\n\nApo-Karshi Road\n\nCost: N6.4 billion\n\nYear: 2011\n\nCurrent status: Unfinished\n\nThe Apo-Karshi stretch road was first awarded at the cost of N6.4 billion to an indigenous construction firm (Kakarta Engineering Limited).\n\nThe road project, according to the FCT administration, was to ease the perennial gridlock being experienced by motorists on the AYA-Nyanya-Mararaba-Keffi road.\n\nHowever, the construction of the road later stopped after the 2015 general election, a situation, which resulted in a public outcry, especially among motorists/civil servants as traffic along the Nyanya-Mararaba-Keffi road worsens and almost becomes a nightmare.\n\nOn assumption of office as FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, on May 2015, ordered the contractor back to the site to continue with the construction of the Apo-Karshi road project, but since then, the completion of the road project has continued to witness a slow pace.\n\nAfter the Federal Executive Council meeting on February 16, 2021, the minister had, while addressing newsmen, pledged that the Apo- Karshi road would be completed before the rainy season sets in.\n\nBello had attributed the delay in completion of the road project to the error of design whereby a huge rock outcrops on the alignment of the road.\n\nMillennium Tower\n\nCost: N69.3billion\n\nYear: 2005\n\nCurrent status: unfinished\n\nThe Millennium Tower, an extensive project, was initiated in 2005 by the Olusegun Obasanjo administration. The Tower was designed to be the tallest tower in Abuja at 170 metres (560ft) with an estimated cost of N69.3bn.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay gathered that for several years, the government did not make budgetary provision for the complex, thereby forcing Salini Nigeria Limited, the Italian firm handling the construction, to suspend work after over N35.7bn had gone into it.\n\nAnalysts say with the current inflation in the prices of building materials, an additional N56bn would be needed to complete the project.\n\nUnfinished Gas projects\n\nCost: $9.8 (OK LNG)\n\nYear: 2005 (OK LNG)\n\nCurrent status: Unfinished (OK LNG)\n\nTwo major gas projects, Olokola Liquefied Natural Gas (OK LNG) project and West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP), capable of making gas a critical catalyst in Nigeria\u2019s economy are currently rioting away with a loss of about N64.96 billion in 2020 despite processing zero gas.\n\nThe OK LNG project (construction and operation of a Four Train LNG plant) and the WAGP (provision of gas transportation) were expected to spur domestic gas demand, generate electricity and strengthen Nigeria\u2019s revenue base.\n\nRead also: Gas rich Nigeria can\u2019t find enough for its power plants\n\nHad the two projects been allowed to come on stream, some stakeholders say it would definitely have served as a major contributor to Nigeria\u2019s economic development and put Nigeria at the forefront of Africa\u2019s gas production.\n\nOther factors leading up to the stalled state of the OK LNG project could be linked to the various controversies around it during former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s regime.\n\nThe former president was accused of sowing the seeds of discomfort with the OK LNG project when he also initiated the project in 2005 barely one year from the conception of the Brass project.\n\nHowever, none of the two LNG projects has progressed beyond the drawing board despite billions of dollars already expended on them. The projects have been stalled by lack of Final Investment Decision (FID) as well as delays caused by unnecessary bickering, lack of political will, despite the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nN7bn Ministry of Agric headquarters\n\nCost: N7.075 billion\n\nYear: 2019\n\nCurrent status: Unfinished\n\nThe former minister of agriculture and rural development, Audu Ogbeh\u2019s request to buy a 10-storey property on Plot 1062, Herbert Macaulay Way, Central Business District in Abuja, from Messrs Efab Properties Limited at the cost of N7.075bn, was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC).\n\nThis building was to serve as the corporate headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture because for over 20 years the ministry operated from a single three-floor complex within the premises of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) and spent over N400m annually in rents for some of its departments.\n\nHowever, since acquiring the building years ago, the building has been abandoned, with nothing done to uplift the structure for administrative use. It was discovered that the building is gradually becoming dilapidated, with the roof already falling off.",

What those who flew the kite for him saw must have been part of that consultation,\u201d the source said.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay also revealed that some other aspirants who have been going about their aspiration secretly would unveil themselves to the public.\n\nWith the release of the revised electoral calendar by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which mandates the conclusion of all party primaries by June 3, it is expected that major contenders for the presidency in 2023 would in the next few weeks push to formally announce their intention to contest ahead of the impending party primaries.\n\nAccording to the new timetable for the 2023 general election released recently by INEC, all political parties are to begin their primaries from April 4 and conclude the primaries elections for all positions by June 3 that is a 60-day or two-month grace period.\n\nIn the last few days, the release of the a new timetable for the 2023 elections has been hailed by politicians, political stakeholders including the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Middle Belt Forum (MBF).\n\nThus, with the new development it is expected that political activities would intensify in the few weeks, while political gladiators are expected to re-align and re-strategies.\n\nAlthough in the last few months, some politicians have publicly declared their interest in the presidency they are currently touring the country, consulting to brighten their chance of succeeding at their party primaries.\n\nSome of them are; national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, former president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa, Ayim Pius Anyim, former Secretary of the Government of the Federation and ex-Senate President; Kingsley Moghalu, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria; Dele Momodu media entrepreneur and journalist and Khadijat Okunnu, an entrepreneur, among many others.\n\nHowever, in the next few days all eyes would be on some political actors to publicly declare their decision to vie for the presidential ticket of their parties they are; Aminu Tambuwal, Governor of Sokoto State, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar; current Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, Minister for Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Minister for Labour and Employment Chris Ngige among others.\n\nRead also: Atiku Abubakar: Nigeria\u2019s tenacious presidential candidate\n\nThe Wazirin Adamawa, who was the PDP presidential candidate in 2019, has not hidden his intention to rule the country after several unsuccessful attempts.\n\nRecently, during a visit to former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Atiku expressed confidence in winning the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nHowever, he has faced criticisms in some quarters over his decision to contest the presidency again, they urged him to drop his ambition and support a younger candidate.\n\nSome of his critics have also advised him to rather support a candidate from Igbo extraction, judging that the region had not produced a president since Nigeria returned to democratic rule in 1999.\n\nAlthough there has been clamour in some quarters for the PDP to zone the presidential ticket, the PDP has remained silent on the issue, encouraging anyone interested to contest for the presidential ticket.\n\nSimilarly, last week, the leadership of the party dismissed media reports it had zoned the presidency to the North.\n\nRecently, Media mogul, Raymond Dokpesi had kick-started a pro-Atiku 2023 solidarity awareness aimed at rallying support for his presidential bid.\n\n.",

          "text": "The daily influx of people from various parts of Nigeria and beyond has widen the housing deficit in Lagos, piling up pressure on existing infrastructure and worsening stress in the city, stakeholders have said.\n\nOver 600 people move to Lagos every day and less than 50 percent of them go back, a government official said.\n\nThose that stay back, according to Moruf Akinderu-Faitai, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Housing, have no prior arrangements as to where to live or what to do in the city.\n\nAkinderu-Fatai, who spoke during an interactive session with newsmen, said Lagos prosperity had become its major challenge \u201cas people come from all over the world to tap from the opportunities it offers.\u201d\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said, \u201cConsidering Lagos\u2019 commercial importance to Nigeria and the opportunities it has, everyone wants to reside in the city to take advantage of these opportunities.\u201d\n\nThough the National Census of 2006 put Lagos\u2019 population at 17 million, managers of the state, which is described as the largest state economy in West Africa, argue that its population is in excess of 20 million.\n\nA new report by BuyLetLive, an online research platform, said, \u201cWith over 20 million population, a household size estimated at 4.9 persons and a housing stock that is as low as 1.49 million units, the city has a critical housing situation.\n\n\u201cThese three numbers paint the true picture of Lagos\u2019 housing deficit, estimated at 3.2 million units.\u201d\n\nAnother report on the state of the Lagos housing market compiled by Pison Housing Company described Lagos as \u201ca very active rental market where over 60 percent of the residents live in rented accommodation, spending over 50 percent of their income on house rent.\u201d\n\nRenaissance Capital, in its \u201836 States of Nigeria\u2019 report compiled in 2019, said there were 4.9 people on the average in each household in Lagos.\n\nThe population and households figures indicate that Lagos needs at least 4.69 million residential units to cater for its population.\n\n\u201cOn the surface, that may look like a small number, but when you juxtapose these numbers with Pison Housing Company\u2019s estimate of Lagos\u2019 residential stock, which it put at 1.49 million residential units, you begin to see the picture more clearly,\u201d Martin Uche, lead researcher at BuyLetLive, said.\n\n\u201cWhen you subtract the 1.49 million housing stock with the 4.69 million units that Lagos needs, it puts the housing deficit for the city at 3.2 million housing units,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cLagos has not been able to meet up to 50 percent of her formal housing demand till date.\u201d\n\nInadequate housing, infrastructure and other amenities such as healthcare, transportation and portable water make Lagos a difficult, stressful city to live in, according to the 2021 Least and Most Stressful Cities Index report by VAAY, a German CBD company.\n\nThe report ranked Nigeria, India, Philippines, Iraq, Afghanistan, Russia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ukraine and Turkey as the top 10 countries with the most stressful cities.\n\nRead also: Tax credit, assets conversion seen narrowing Nigeria\u2019s housing gap\n\nIt ranked Lagos 99th position, which makes it the second most stressful city, attributing that to the state\u2019s poor healthcare, safety, traffic congestion, noise pollution and unemployment.\n\nBeing one of the most stressful cities also makes Lagos one of the worst places to live in. According to data from the Global Liveability Index, the city was within the range of 137th-139th position out of a total of 140 cities in the world from 2011 to 2019.\n\nThe VAAY report said struggling with a high population of over 20 million due to economic reasons had made living in the city became unhealthily crowded, adding that this might worsen further by year 2050, when Lagos population is expected to double.\n\nBut the Babajide Sanwo-Olu government has been making efforts to ensure that residents of the state are properly housed. Many housing projects started by previous administrations in the state have been completed.\n\nNotable among them are the 492-housing-unit Lateef Jakande Estate in Igando in Alimosho area of the state, the 744 housing units delivered in Ijeshatedo and about 460 housing units completed in an estate in Ikorodu.\n\n\u201cIf you live in Lagos, one thing you cannot deny is the fact that rental rates in most locations across the state have more than doubled over the past five years. This was confirmed from our experience over the period, alongside our interaction with long-standing agents in the market,\u201d Uche said.",

I respectfully urge you, your royal majesty to take this on too as a major task because, just as it has been mentioned, our country depends a great deal on oil production,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nOsinbajo emphasized that, the nation\u2019s desire was to see that security challenges in Delta State were brought to an end in most of the oil-producing communities.\n\n\u201cWe recognize, especially with security that very few administrations had been confronted with this plethora of security challenges that we have been confronted with.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the share number and range of those security challenges, it\u2019s evident that it is necessary to have a leader such as Muhammadu Buhari to be able to take on those challenges, but the role of traditional rulership is critical, absolutely critical now,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the palace of the Ovie of Uvwie Kingdom, Osinbajo lauded the monarch for his role in sustaining the peace in Uvwie kingdom.\n\nHe reiterated that in view of the fact that traditional rulers were more in touch with the grassroots, there was the need for the National Assembly to incorporate and apportion them constitutional roles.\n\nHe prayed that with the level of politics gathering momentum, the National Assembly would be able to finish its constitutional duty and amend the constitution as expected.\n\nEarlier in a welcome address, the Ovie of Uvwie Kingdom had expressed surprise that despite their presentations to the National Assembly, the Committee on Constitutional Review paid no attention to the need for a constitutional role for traditional rulers.\n\nHe appealed to the executive to intervene and commended the Federal Government for the continuous support for the traditional institutions.\n\nAlso responding in his palace earlier, the Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse 111 commended the Federal Government for all its efforts in repositioning the country.\n\nHe pledged the support of the traditional institutions in supporting the government towards returning peace to the country.\n\nThe royal father particularly commended the Vice President for the supportive roles to the President adding \u201d thank you for the good works you have been doing, supporting Mr. President and putting Nigeria first.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Delta State governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, who was represented by his deputy, Otuaro, harped on the need for a constitutional role for traditional rulers.\n\nHe assured that the state administration would leave good legacies behind at the expiration of the tenure in 2023, just as he commended the Olu of Warri for his fatherly support to the administration in the state.\n\nThe Vice President was in Delta State for the Thanksgiving ceremony of late Chief Patrick Ideh, aged 95, a nationalist lawyer since 1961.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I will not decamp from the PDP; we will always win any election. PDP won in the last election and we will continue to win all elections in the state and country; nothing will stop us as a party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor noted that the forthcoming local government election in the state will set the template for next year\u2019s national and legislative elections, urging party members to reflect on the elections and work in unity to ensure victory in the polls.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThere is no division in Edo PDP. Let the party be open to accommodate others. PDP is democratic. The hallmark of democracy is ensuring that the majority has their way, as the minority can\u2019t dictate to the people.\n\n\u201cI heard that Chief Dan Orbih went around, saying there is no harmonization in Edo PDP. This is really irresponsible to say and an insult to members of the party, as the party has truly harmonised in the state.\n\n\u201cPDP in Edo State is harmonised because before we made any appointments in any ward, we made sure the party at that level was harmonised. We are gathered here now as election timetable is out; harmonisation has been done, appointments made and we are ready to win any election before us.\u201d\n\nObaseki disclosed that the PDP National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu will visit the state on Thursday 10th of March 2022, urging party leaders to bring along five percent of newly registered members to welcome the party chair.\n\n\u201cPolitics is not about fighting but dialogue and discussion. I urge us to collaborate and unite to move the party and state forward,\u201d he charged.\n\nNoting that over 539,000 members have been registered in the ongoing e-registration exercise, Obaseki said, \u201cThese numbers are not fabricated as we have the data, pictures, emails and phone numbers of members of the party we have registered so far. You have broken records as this is the bastion of PDP in Nigeria. We have changed the face of politics in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI didn\u2019t give leaders any resources to mobilize them but rather they challenged themselves and achieved the goal to register more members in the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people went around saying people should not join our party. No true party man will do that. Those that engaged in that are not true members of the party and don\u2019t belong to Edo PDP. If not, they will not push people away from the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus now is on how to engage our members, making them participate in the policy-making process of the party. We don\u2019t need to wait for an election before we act.\u201d\n\nCharging detractors sponsoring disunity in the state to stop forthwith, the governor stated, \u201cEdo is Edo, leave Edo State alone. They have tried us in battle, and have been made to know that we are battle-ready. We have been tested and trusted. We must always win elections; we must always win as a party.\n\nThe Chairman PDP Edo State, Anthony Aziegbemi, noted that \u201cEdo State is the only state in the nation that has surpassed the 500,000 thresholds for e-registration of the party.\u201d\n\nOthers at the meeting include the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu; Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA), Hon. Marcus Onobun; Senator Matthew Urhoghide; Senator Clifford Odia; Chief Tom Ikimi; Hon.

It tests ones\u2019 patience, character, and concentration beyond the physical exercise that one receives from playing the game.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cEdo is regarded as a home of golf in Nigeria despite other golf clubs trying to establish themselves as the first golf club in Nigeria. Edo is special and we know that the British troop that invaded the Benin Empire stayed back and developed the golf section about 76 years ago.\n\n\u201cThis is an inheritance that must be treasured and as a government, we are focusing and emphasizing the cleaning and greening of the golf section. We will be working with you in planting trees as many of the trees planted have fallen. So we need to address that.\n\n\u201cI urge you to encourage a lot of private sector participation in the activities of the club.

          "text": "Persistent fighting blocked efforts to evacuate 200,000 people from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol for a second day in a row on Sunday as Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to press ahead with his offensive, which he said was going to plan, unless Kyiv surrendered.\n\nMost people trapped in the port city are sleeping underground to escape more than six days of near-constant shelling by encircling Russian forces that has cut off food, water, power and heating supplies, according to the Ukrainian authorities.\n\nThe civilian death toll from hostilities across Ukraine since Moscow launched its invasion on Feb. 24 stood at 364, including more than 20 children, the United Nations said on Sunday, adding hundreds more were injured.\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said most civilian casualties were caused by the use of \u201cexplosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.\u201d\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied attacking civilian areas.\n\nIn Irpin, a town some 25 km (16 miles) northwest of the capital Kyiv, men, women and children trying to escape heavy fighting in the area were forced to take cover when missiles struck nearby, according to Reuters witnesses.\n\nSoldiers and fellow residents helped the elderly hurry to a bus filled with frightened people, some cowering as they waited to be driven to safety. read more\n\nThe invasion has drawn almost universal condemnation around the world, sent more than 1.5 million Ukrainians fleeing from the country, and triggered sweeping Western sanctions against Russia aimed at crippling its economy. The Biden administration said on Sunday it was exploring banning Russian oil imports. read more\n\n\u201cWar is madness, please stop,\u201d Pope Francis said in his weekly address to crowds in St Peter\u2019s Square, adding that \u201crivers of blood and tears\u201d were flowing in Ukraine\u2019s war.\n\nPutin made his demand for Kyiv to end the fighting in a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who appealed for a ceasefire. Putin told Erdogan he was ready for dialogue with Ukraine and foreign partners but any attempt to draw out negotiation would fail, a Kremlin statement said.\n\nRussian media said Putin also spoke by phone for almost two hours with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron told Putin he was concerned about a possible imminent attack on southern Ukraine\u2019s historic port city of Odessa, Macron\u2019s office said.\n\nAnti-war protests took place around the world including in Russia itself, where police detained more than 4,300 people, an independent protest monitoring group said. The interior ministry said 3,500 demonstrators had been held, included 1,700 people in Moscow and 750 in St Petersburg. read more\n\nThousands of protesters chanted \u201cNo to war!\u201d and \u201cShame on you!\u201d, according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers. Reuters was unable to independently verify the footage and photographs.\n\nDemonstrations were also taking place in Western capitals as well as in India and Kazakhstan, after jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny called for worldwide protests against the war.\n\nIn the besieged city of Mariupol, authorities had said on Sunday they would make a second attempt to evacuate some of the 400,000 residents. But the ceasefire plan collapsed, as it had on Saturday, with each side blaming the other.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said the failed attempt to evacuate 200,000 people had underscored \u201cthe absence of a detailed and functioning agreement between the parties to the conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re destroying us,\u201d Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko told Reuters in a video call, describing the city\u2019s plight before the latest evacuation effort failed. \u201cThey will not even give us an opportunity to count the wounded and the killed because the shelling does not stop.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States has seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians in Ukraine, adding that Washington was documenting them to support appropriate organizations in their potential war crimes investigation over Russia\u2019s actions.\n\nMoscow calls its campaign a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, saying it has no plans to occupy Ukraine.\n\nA huge Russian convoy north of Kyiv appears to have made limited progress in recent days, although Russia\u2019s defence ministry released footage on Sunday showing some tracked military vehicles on the move.\n\nIn the capital, Ukrainian soldiers bolstered defences by digging trenches, blocking roads and liaising with civil defence units as Russian forces bombarded areas nearby.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russian rockets had destroyed the civilian airport of the central-western region capital of Vinnytsia on Sunday.\n\nRussian forces opened fire at a protest against their occupation of the southern Ukrainian city of Nova Kakhovka on Sunday, wounding five people, Ukrainian news agency Interfax Ukraine said, citing eyewitnesses.\n\nThe World Health Organization said there had been several attacks on Ukrainian healthcare facilities during the conflict, causing deaths and injuries. It gave no details.\n\nKyiv renewed its appeal to the West to toughen sanctions, and also requested more weapons, including a plea for Russian-made planes, to help it repel Russian forces.\n\nSpeaking on a trip to neighbouring Moldova, Blinken said Washington was considering how it could backfill aircraft for Poland, if Warsaw decided to supply its warplanes to Ukraine.\n\nPutin says he wants a \u201cdemilitarised\u201d, \u201cdenazified\u201d and neutral Ukraine, and on Saturday likened Western sanctions \u201cto a declaration of war\u201d.\n\nThe West, which calls Putin\u2019s reasons for invading baseless, has expanded effort to rearm Ukraine, sending in items from Stinger missiles to anti-tank weapons. But Washington and its NATO allies have resisted Ukraine\u2019s plea for a no-fly zone, saying it would escalate the conflict beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nUkrainians continued to pour into Poland, Romania, Slovakia and elsewhere. The United Nations said over 1.5 million had fled in Europe\u2019s fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two.\n\nWestern sanctions have pushed many companies to exit investments in Russia, while some Russian banks have been shut out of a global financial payment systems, driving down the rouble and forcing Moscow to jack up interest rates.\n\nOn Sunday, American Express Co (AXP.N) said it was suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus. Video sharing app TikTok said it was suspending livestreaming and the uploading of new content to its service in Russia.\n\nSpeaking on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d show, Blinken said the United States and European partners are exploring banning Russian oil imports, but stressed the importance of steady oil supplies globally.\n\nThe West has so far refrained from direct measures on Russian energy exports after oil soared to multi-year highs.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military said more than 11,000 Russian troops had been killed so far and 88 Russian aircraft shot down since the start of the invasion. Reuters could not corroborate the claim. Russia has not given regular updates on its death toll.\n\nTass news agency cited Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov as saying virtually the entire Ukrainian air force had been destroyed. In the last 36 hours alone, he said, Ukraine had lost 11 combat aircraft and two helicopters. Reuters had no way of corroborating the claim.",

          "title": "Fleeing Sanctions, Russian Oligarchs Seek Safe Ports for Superyachts",
          "text": "The massive superyacht Dilbar stretches one-and-a-half football fields in length, about as long as a World War I dreadnought. It boasts two helipads, berths for more than 130 people and a 25-meter swimming pool long enough to accommodate another whole superyacht.\n\nDilbar was launched in 2016 at a reported cost of more than $648 million. Five years on, its purported owner, the Kremlin-aligned Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, was already dissatisfied and sent the vessel to a German shipyard last fall for a retrofit reportedly costing another couple hundred million dollars.\n\nThat\u2019s where she lay in drydock on Thursday when the United States and European Union announced economic sanctions against Usmanov \u2014 a metals magnate and early investor in Facebook \u2014 over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets,\u201d President Joe Biden said during his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, addressing the oligarchs. \u201cWe are coming for your ill-begotten gains.\u201d\n\nBut actually seizing the behemoth boats could prove challenging. Russian billionaires have had decades to shield their money and assets in the West from governments that might try to tax or seize them.\n\nSeveral media outlets reported Wednesday that German authorities had impounded Dilbar. But a spokeswoman for Hamburg state\u2019s economy ministry told The Associated Press no such action had yet been taken because it had been unable to establish ownership of the yacht, which is named for Usmanov\u2019s mother.\n\nDilbar is flagged in the Cayman Islands and registered to a holding company in Malta, two secretive banking havens where the global ultra-rich often park their wealth.\n\nStill, in the industry that caters to the exclusive club of billionaires and centimillionaires that can afford to buy, crew and maintain superyachts, it is often an open secret who owns what.\n\nWorking with the U.K.-based yacht valuation firm VesselsValue, the AP compiled a list of 56 superyachts \u2014 generally defined as luxury vessels exceeding 24 meters (79 feet) in length \u2014 believed to be owned by a few dozen Kremlin-aligned oligarchs, seaborne assets with a combined market value estimated at more than $5.4 billion.\n\nThe AP then used two online services \u2014 VesselFinder and MarineTraffic \u2014 to plot the last known locations of the yachts as relayed by their onboard tracking beacons.\n\nWhile many are still anchored at or near sun-splashed playgrounds in the Mediterranean and Caribbean, more than a dozen were underway to or had already arrived in remote ports in small nations such as the Maldives and Montenegro, potentially beyond the reach of Western sanctions. Three are moored in Dubai, where many wealthy Russians have vacation homes.\n\nAnother three had gone dark, their transponders last pinging just outside the Bosporus in Turkey \u2014 gateway to the Black Sea and the southern Russian ports of Sochi and Novorossiysk.\n\nGraceful, a German-built Russian-flagged superyacht believed to belong to Putin, left a repair yard in Hamburg on Feb. 7, two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. It is now moored in the Russian Baltic port of Kaliningrad, beyond the reach of Western sanctions imposed against him this past week.\n\nSome Russian oligarchs appear to have not gotten the memo to move their superyachts, despite weeks of public warnings of Putin\u2019s planned invasion.\n\nFrench authorities seized the superyacht Amore Vero on Thursday in the Mediterranean resort town of La Ciotat. The boat is believed to belong to Igor Sechin, a Putin ally who runs Russian oil giant Rosneft, which has been on the U.S. sanctions list since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\nThe French Finance Ministry said in a statement that customs authorities boarded the 289-foot Amore Vero and discovered its crew was preparing for an urgent departure, even though planned repair work wasn\u2019t finished. The $120 million boat is registered to a company that lists Sechin as its primary shareholder.\n\nOn Saturday, Italian financial police in the port of San Remo seized the 132-foot superyacht Lena, which is flagged in the British Virgin Islands. Authorities said the boat belongs to Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch close to Putin and among those sanctioned by the European Union. With an estimated net worth of $16.2 billion, Timchenko is the founder of the Volga Group, which specializes in investments in energy, transport and infrastructure assets.\n\nThe 213-foot Lady M was also seized by the Italians while moored in the Riviera port town of Imperia. In a tweet announcing the seizure on Friday, a spokesman for Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the comparatively modest $27 million vessel was the property of sanctioned steel baron Alexei Mordashov, listed as Russia\u2019s wealthiest man with a fortune of about $30 billion.\n\nBut Mordashov\u2019s upsized yacht, the 464-foot Nord, was safely at anchor on Friday in the Seychelles, a tropical island chain in the Indian Ocean not under the jurisdiction of U.S. or EU sanctions. Among the world\u2019s biggest superyachts, Nord has a market value of $500 million.\n\nSince Friday, Italy has seized 143 million euros ($156 million) in luxury yachts and villas in some of its most picturesque destinations, including Sardinia, the Ligurian coast and Lake Como.\n\nMost of the Russians on the annual Forbes list of billionaires have not yet been sanctioned by the United States and its allies, and their superyachts are still cruising the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nThe evolution of oligarch yachts goes back to the tumultuous decade after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, as state oil and metals industries were sold off at rock-bottom prices, often to politically connected Russian businessmen and bankers who had provided loans to the new Russian state in exchange for the shares.\n\nRussia\u2019s nouveau riche began buying luxury yachts similar in size and expense to those owned by Silicon Valley billionaires, heads of state and royalty. It\u2019s a key marker of status in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and size matters.\n\n\u201cNo self-respecting Russian oligarch would be without a superyacht,\u201d said William Browder, a U.S.-born and now London-based financier who worked in Moscow for years before becoming one of the Putin regime\u2019s most vocal foreign critics. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the rite of passage to being an oligarch. It\u2019s just a prerequisite.\u201d\n\nAs their fortunes ballooned, there was something of an arms race among the oligarchs, with the richest among them accumulating personal fleets of ever more lavish boats.\n\nFor example, Russian metals and petroleum magnate Roman Abramovich is believed to have bought or built at least seven of the world\u2019s largest yachts, some of which he has since sold off to other oligarchs.\n\nIn 2010, Abramovich launched the Bermuda-flagged Eclipse, which at 533 feet was at the time the world\u2019s longest superyacht. Features include a wood-burning firepit and swimming pool that transforms into a dance floor. Eclipse also boasts its own helicopter hangar and an undersea bay that reportedly holds a mini-sub.\n\nDennis Cauiser, a superyacht analyst with VesselsFinder, said oligarch boats often include secret security measures worthy of a Bond villain, including underwater escape hatches, bulletproof windows and armored panic rooms.\n\n\u201cEclipse is equipped with all sorts of special features, including missile launchers and self-defense systems on board,\u201d Cauiser said. \u201cIt has a secret submarine evacuation area and things like that.\u201d\n\nEclipse was soon eclipsed by Azzam, purportedly owned by the emir of Abu Dhabi, which claimed the title of longest yacht when it was launched in 2013. Three years after that, Usmanov launched Dilbar, which replaced another slightly smaller yacht by the same name. The new Dilbar is the world\u2019s largest yacht by volume.\n\nAbramovich, whose fortune is estimated at $12.4 billion, fired back last year by launching Solaris. While not as long as Eclipse or as big as Dilbar, the $600 million Bermuda-flagged boat is possibly even more luxurious. Eight stories tall, Solaris features a sleek palisade of broad teak-covered decks suitable for hosting a horde of well-heeled partygoers.\n\nBut no boat is top dog for long. At least 20 superyachts are reported to be under construction in various Northern European shipyards, including a $500 million superyacht being built for the American billionaire Jeff Bezos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about ego,\u201d Cauiser said. \u201cThey all want to have the best, the longest, the most valuable, the newest, the most luxurious.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, the escalating U.S. and EU sanctions on Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian banks have sent a chill through the industry, with boatbuilders and staff worried they won\u2019t be paid. It can cost upwards of $50 million a year to crew, fuel and maintain a superyacht.\n\nThe crash of the ruble and the tanking of Moscow stock market have depleted the fortunes of Russia\u2019s elite, with several people dropping off the list of Forbes billionaires last week. Cauiser said he expects some oligarch superyachts will soon quietly be listed by brokers at fire-sale prices.\n\nThe 237-foot Stella Maris, which was seen by an AP journalist docked this past week in Nice, France, was believed to be owned by Rashid Sardarov, a Russian billionaire oil and gas magnate. After publication of an earlier version of this story, AP was contacted Sunday by yacht broker Joan Plana Palao, who said his company represents a U.S. citizen from California who purchased the Stella Maris last month. He declined to disclose the name of the buyer or the person from whom the boat had been purchased.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a new round of sanctions that included a press release touting Usmanov\u2019s close ties to Putin and photos of Dilbar and the oligarch\u2019s private jet, a custom-built 209-foot Airbus A340-300 passenger liner. Treasury said Usmanov\u2019s aircraft is believed to have cost up to $500 million and is named Bourkhan, after his father.\n\nUsmanov, whose fortune has recently shrunk to about $17 billion, criticized the sanctions.\n\n\u201cI believe that such a decision is unfair and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honor, dignity and business reputation,\u201d he said in a statement issued through the website of the International Fencing Federation, of which he has served as president since 2008.\n\nAbramovich has not yet been sanctioned. Members of the British Parliament have criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not going after Abramovich\u2019s U.K.-based assets, which include the professional soccer club Chelsea. Under mounting pressure, the oligarch announced this past week he would sell the $2.5 billion team and give the net proceeds \u201cfor the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, location transponders showed Solaris moored in Barcelona, Spain, on Saturday. Eclipse set sail from St. Maarten late Thursday and is underway in the Caribbean Sea, destination undisclosed.",

          "text": "A second attempt to evacuate civilians from a besieged city in southern Ukraine collapsed Sunday amid renewed Russian shelling, while Russian President Vladimir Putin turned the blame for the war back on Ukraine and said Moscow\u2019s invasion could be halted \u201conly if Kyiv ceases hostilities.\u201d\n\nFood, water, medicine and almost all other supplies were in desperately short supply in the port city of Mariupol, where Russian and Ukrainian forces had agreed to an 11-hour cease-fire that would allow civilians and the wounded to be evacuated.

Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine and along the coast, but many of its efforts have become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy rallied his people to remain defiant, especially those in cities that Russian soldiers have entered.\n\n\u201cYou should take to the streets! You should fight!\u201d he said Saturday on Ukrainian television. \u201cIt is necessary to go out and drive this evil out of our cities, from our land.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy also asked the U.S. and NATO countries to send more warplanes to Ukraine, though that idea is complicated by questions about which countries would provide the aircraft and how those countries would replace the planes.\n\nThe war, now in its 11th day, has caused 1.5 million people to flee the country. The head of the U.N. refugee agency called the exodus \u201cthe fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.\u201d\n\nAs he has often done, Putin blamed Ukraine for the war, telling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday that Kyiv needed to stop all hostilities and fulfill \u201cthe well-known demands of Russia.\u201d\n\nPutin launched his attack with a string of false accusations against Kyiv, including that it is led by neo-Nazis intent on undermining Russia with the development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Russian leader also told Erdogan he hoped Ukraine \u201cwould show a more constructive approach (to talks), fully taking into account the emerging realities.\u201d A third round of Russia-Ukraine negotiations is scheduled for Monday.\n\nPutin and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke about the nuclear situation in Ukraine, which has 15 nuclear reactors and was the scene of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\nThe men agreed in principle to a \u201cdialogue\u201d involving Russia, Ukraine and the U.N.\u2019s atomic watchdog, according to a French official who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with the presidency\u2019s practices. Potential talks on the issue are to be organized in the coming days, he said.\n\nPutin also blamed the fire last week at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which Ukrainian officials said was caused by Russian attackers, on a \u201cprovocation organized by Ukrainian radicals.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttempts to shift responsibility for this incident onto the Russian military are part of a cynical propaganda campaign,\u201d he said, according to the French official.\n\nInternational leaders, as well as Pope Francis, appealed to Putin to negotiate.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the pope said he had dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine, saying the Vatican would do everything it could to end the conflict.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing,\u201d the pontiff said in his traditional Sunday blessing. \u201cThis is not just a military operation, but a war that sows death, destruction and misery.\u201d\n\nAfter the cease-fire in Mariupol failed to hold Saturday, Russian forces intensified their shelling of the city and dropped massive bombs on residential areas of Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nThe handful of residents who managed to flee Mariupol before the humanitarian corridor closed said the city of 430,000 had been devastated.\n\n\u201cWe saw everything: houses burning, all the people sitting in basements,\u201d said Yelena Zamay, who fled to one of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. \u201cNo communication, no water, no gas, no light, no water. There was nothing.\u201d\n\nBritish military officials compared Russia\u2019s tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, where surrounded cities were pulverized by airstrikes and artillery.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,\u201d the U.K. Ministry of Defense said.\n\nZelenskyy reiterated a request for foreign protectors to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which NATO so far has ruled out because of concerns such an action would lead to a far wider war.\n\n\u201cThe world is strong enough to close our skies,\u201d Zelenskyy said Sunday in a video address.\n\nThe day before, Zelenskyy pleaded with American lawmakers in a video call to help get more warplanes to Ukraine.\n\nU.S. officials say Washington is discussing ways to get the planes to Ukraine in a complex scenario that would include sending American-made F-16s to former Soviet bloc nations, particularly Poland, that are now members of NATO. Those countries would then send Ukraine their own Soviet-era MiGs, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.\n\nBut because of production backlogs on the U.S. warplanes, the Eastern European nations would essentially have to give their MiGs to the Ukrainians and accept U.S. promises that they would get F-16s as soon as that was possible. Adding to the difficulties is the fact that the next shipment of F-16s is destined for Taiwan, and the U.S. Congress would be reluctant to delay those deliveries.\n\nThe Russian military has warned Ukraine\u2019s neighbors against hosting its warplanes, saying that Moscow may consider those counties part of the conflict if Ukrainian aircraft fly combat missions from their territory.\n\nThe death toll remains lost in the fog of war. The U.N. says it has confirmed just a few hundred civilian deaths but also warned that the number is a vast undercount.\n\nOleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Ukrainian officials and international humanitarian organizations were working with Russia through intermediaries to establish humanitarian corridors from Bucha and Hostomel, which are Kyiv suburbs where there has been heavy fighting.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military is greatly outmatched by Russia\u2019s, but its professional and volunteer forces have fought back with fierce tenacity. In Kyiv, volunteers lined up Saturday to join the military.\n\nEven in cities that have fallen, there were signs of resistance.\n\nOnlookers in Chernihiv cheered as they watched a Russian military plane fall from the sky and crash, according to video released by the Ukrainian government. In Kherson, hundreds of protesters waved blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and shouted, \u201cGo home.\u201d\n\nRussia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov. Capturing Mariupol could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that most other countries considered illegal.\n\nThe West has broadly backed Ukraine, offering aid and weapon shipments and slapping Russia with vast sanctions. But no NATO troops have been sent to Ukraine, leaving Ukrainians to fight Russian troops alone.\n\nRussia\u2019s economy has been devastated by the sanctions, with the ruble plunging in value and dozens of multinational companies ending or dramatically scaling back their work in the country. On Sunday, American Express announced it would suspend operations in Russia, as well as in Russian-allied Belarus. Globally issued American Express cards will no longer work at stores or ATMs in Russia, the company said, and AmEx cards issued in Russia by local banks will also no longer work outside the country.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent the weekend visiting NATO member nations in Eastern Europe that have taken in refugees from Ukraine. In Moldova on Sunday, he pledged support for the Western-leaning former Soviet republic that is warily watching Russia\u2019s moves in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.N. said it would increase its humanitarian operations both inside and outside Ukraine, and the Security Council scheduled a meeting for Monday on the worsening situation.\n\nThe U.N. World Food Program has warned of an impending hunger crisis in Ukraine, a major global wheat supplier, saying millions will need food aid \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
