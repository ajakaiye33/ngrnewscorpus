          "text": "THE courage and energy of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi make him the preferred candidate to clinch the Presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress ahead of the 2023 election, a former governorship candidate in Rivers State, Tonye Princewill has stated.\n\nSpeaking during an interactive meeting with select journalists in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Princewill said it would take a politician of Amaechi\u2019s pedigree to to tackle the myriads of problems confronting the nation.\n\nHe further said the former Rivers State Governor is the only credible person that has what it takes to move the country to the next level.\n\nPrincewill noted that if performance and the knowledge of Nigeria\u2019s politics were criteria to determine who should be the country\u2019s President in 2023, \u201cthen the cap fits Rotimi Amaechi.\u201d\n\nHe said that the wealth of experience Amaechi has gathered over the years as two-time speaker, chairman of the Speakers Forum; two-term governor; chairman of Nigerian Governors Forum; \u2018\u2019Director-General who sacked a sitting President and the best performing minister makes him the best man for the job.\u201d\n\nPrincewill noted that though Amaechi may be stubborn, \u201che is very stubborn for results. He does not take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer. He goes for results and he has always gotten results in anything he sets his eyes on.\n\nHe added, \u201cAmaechi took over the moribund railway industry and transformed it to something that we all can be proud of as a people.

Then it was 20 per cent on each trip they charged as commission on Bolt. All of a sudden, it was increased to 25 per cent. There was no communication or any notice from them. Several complaints have been made to Bolt but they are yet to give us reasons for their actions.\n\n\u201cThat five per cent is a lot. For instance, if they are taking N2, 000 for the whole day, it won\u2019t be a problem, but you are deducting 25 per cent on each trip. We maintain our cars; spare parts are expensive, we fuel our cars, we do most of the work.\n\n\u201cWhat they are offering is just the platform. They increased the commission and the fare remains the same. We are not against the increase in commission; let it not be a loss on our part. I went to fix my fuel pump on Monday, the price has risen from N8,000 to N20,000.\n\n\u201cOn the app at times, you see N20,000 and you would be surprised you may not have more than N8,000 from the N20, 000. This is after deducting their commission, they could remove like N5,000 as commission, now you are left with N15, 000.\u201d\n\nA female Bolt driver, who gave her name simply as Jenny said a lot of benefits that allowed them to earn more had been taken away by the e-hailing company.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhat have drivers done to bolt? They came with a lot of incentives. All of them are no more. Initially they started with 15 per cent incentive; they were giving drivers promo as well as the customers.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "2023: Buhari, Jonathan tip Anyim for higher responsibilities",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the duo of President Muhammadu Buhari and ex-President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, commended the leadership qualities of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, saying he has all it takes to be entrusted with higher responsibilities in the future.\n\nIn their separate remarks at an event in Abuja to honour Anyim on the occasion of his 61st birthday, they described Anyim as a humble leader who sees the entire country as single constituency.\n\nPresident Buhari, represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, noted that at various times while serving in different capacities, Anyim rose to the challenge of leadership by putting the nation first.\n\nHe said: \u201cSenator Pius Anyim is a patriotic Nigerian who always puts his nation first and he is one of stabilizing voices we have today in the politics of our country. This he has demonstrated in a number of times, but the one that stands out and still echoes with me was his insistence that elected officers should always stay a single term and he kept to his word by not seeking for re-election to the Senate, after the expiration of his first term as Senator and Senate President in 2003.\n\n\u201cThat many Nigerians cutting across various political divides are gathered here today to celebrate you is a glowing testimony of your contributions to the growth of our nation and its political development,\u201d Buhari stated.\n\nIn what would count as an endorsement of Anyim\u2019s 2023 Presidential aspiration, Mustapha added that the experiences garnered over the years by the former Senate President place him at a vantage position to seek a higher political calling.\n\nHe continued: \u201cLet me say on a personal note, as the current and 19th SGF that I have drawn a lot from the wealth of wisdom that has been the source of strength and the endowment that Senator Anyim has brought to the fore of governance in this country. We don\u2019t often meet but whenever we meet, we share knowledge about the responsibilities of the office and the enormity of the act of balancing contending forces and interests, that is always vested on any occupant of that office.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to thank you (Anyim), for the wealth of experience and the depth of knowledge that we have. I made bold to say whoever had occupied the Office of the Secretary to the government for four years In an evolving democracy like Nigeria, with diverse contentious issues, is capable and able to occupy any office,\u201d he added.\n\nLike Buhari, Jonathan described Anyim as a unique leader who never allowed the trappings of office to get into his head.\n\nFor Jonathan, the sheer number of people gathered at the International Conference Centre to honour Anyim was an indication of the trust Nigerians reposed in his years after leaving the office as Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\n\n\u201cSome people are very busy and on most Saturdays, some people don\u2019t like to wake up early. For you to have gathered these numbers as early as this time today means a lot.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for you today, your wife, your children, all your friends, with all of us here your friends, otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have been here to celebrate you today. You are a Government somebody that I know a little.\n\n\u201cYou were the Senate President when I was the governor of Bayelsa state and I remembered you visited me in the house one day and of course by divine providence, you became the engine of my government as my Secretary to the government of the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe first day I became President, Anyim Pius Anyim wanted to be chairman of PDP and he came to me with a lot of dreams and we spoke. I may not bother you with details but he was never the chairman of PDP.\n\n\u201cWhen he became the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, he did not even come to me with a biscuit but we found him worthy as a Nigerian that had experience in managing systems, managing issues and also somebody who had friends across the country and when we were looking at the person we wanted to be the Secretary to the Government, of course, we wanted somebody from the South-East because PDP then normally made sure that every geo-political zone had one key office. Now, we don\u2019t have enough people, so we don\u2019t have that.\n\n\u201cUp to the time I was the President, something somehow happened in a way that we never expected. The PDP philosophy then was that the President will come from one geo-political zone, the Vice President from one geo-political zone, Secretary to Government from the one-geo political zone, the Chairman of the party from one geo-political, the Senate President from one geo-political zone and the Speaker from one geo-political zone but that was when PDP had a lot of spread across the country.\n\n\u201cNow it is difficult to package that because even the All Progressives Congress, APC doesn\u2019t have that kind of spread. So, it is difficult to get that package. That was very unique and it was a good way of accommodating every section of the country.\n\n\u201cAnd so we zoned the Secretary to the Government to the South-East. We looked at our brothers and sisters, the characters, and they were very nice people. They had many competent people but let me say that it\u2019s like a lot it fell on Anyim Pius Anyim and we made him the Secretary to the Government. And I don\u2019t regret committing him. He is a very hard working young man, committed to serving this nation and I believe if he has the opportunity to serve more, he can do better,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\nAt 61, Anyim is a bridge between the old and the young and that fact was not lost on Jonathan when he said: \u201cToday, we are celebrating a young man but you are getting old now. At 61 years, you are no longer very young but you are willing to serve and as somebody who has served at the parliament as a Senate President, at the executive level as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, it is quite tasking.\n\n\u201cHaving served in that position (SGF) for the period, I know he is fully baked and I didn\u2019t receive too many complaints. You know as a President, every day you receive complaints from those who work for you- the ministers, your aides, advisers, assistants and so on. I didn\u2019t receive too many complaints about Anyim Pius Anyim,\u201d he added.\n\nFormer Vice President, Namadi Sambo who came with Jonathan also took to the podium to pour encomiums on the celebrant, saying, \u201chis leadership stabilized the Senate and we must be grateful for that. He was a team player who worked towards a prosperous nation. He can be trusted with higher political responsibility in the future.\u201d\n\nFormer Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Bello Adoke in his goodwill message described Anyim as \u2018a team player, a humble leader that is always ready to take on any task for the good of his country.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, former governor of Abia state, Sen. Theodore Orji said at 61, Anyim has a lot still to give to his fatherland. \u201cIf you look at the age he started, you will know that God has not finished with him,\u201d he stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "\u201cAnd I want to thank you (Anyim), for the wealth of experience and the depth of knowledge that we have.\nLike Buhari, Jonathan described Anyim as a unique leader who never allowed the trappings of office to get into his head.\n\u201cThe first day I became President, Anyim Pius Anyim wanted to be chairman of PDP and he came to me with a lot of dreams and we spoke.\nThey had many competent people but let me say that it\u2019s like a lot it fell on Anyim Pius Anyim and we made him the Secretary to the Government.\nI didn\u2019t receive too many complaints about Anyim Pius Anyim,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Former Governor of Enugu State, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, has made case for Isi-Uzo Local Area of the state to produce the successor of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi in 2023.\n\nThis came on day the Senator representing Enugu North senatorial zone, Senator Chuka Utazi, spoke in the same line, saying Enugu North zone where the incumbent governor comes from deserved another eight consecutive years.\n\nNwodo made the case on Friday when Governor Ugwuanyi led the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) hierarchy and faithful in the state to rally votes for the party\u2019s chairmanship and councillorship candidates in Igbo-Etiti and Nsukka local governments in the forthcoming council election scheduled for Wednesday next week.\n\nAccording to him, if power should go to Enugu East, it has to be Isi-Uzo, noting that the people had long been marginalised since they were carved into Enugu East zone, which is predominantly Nkanu people.\n\nIt is recalled that Nwodo, speaking on the the zoning of PDP\u2019s presidential ticket on a national television last week explained that the PDP\u2019s idea of zoning was for power to rotate amomg the six geo-political to give every part of the country a sense of belonging.\n\nThe medical doctor turned politician, who served as both a National Secretary and National Chairman of the PDP, said after power had gone round, the party and nation would be free to then go for the most competent person going forward, irrespective of his zone.\n\nWhereas power is yet to fully rotate among the six geo-political zones of Nigeria, the three senatorial zones of Enugu State have all produced two-term governors since 1999, with Governor Ugwuanyi, who hails from Enugu North, completing his second term in 2023.\n\nHowever, in what many see as a vault face or different measures for different people, Nwodo canvassed micro-zoning of Enugu\u2019s gubernatorial position to Isi-Uzo LGA in Enugu, hinging his proposition on what he termed justice for Isi-Uzo, not competence.\n\nAs the scheming over which zone should produce the next governor in 2023, Dr. Nwodo, who hails from Enugu North senatorial zone (popularly referred to as Nsukka zone) believes that Isi-Uzo, which is the only local government among the six local governments in Enugu East zone that shares both kinship and cultural affinity with Enugu North, where both himself and Ugwuanyi hails from, should be given the opportunity to succeed the incumbent.\n\nThe last governor from Enugu East senatorial zone, which is making strong case to produce Ugwuanyi\u2019s successor.\n\nThey insist that being the first to occupy the Enugu governoship seat in the current democratic era between 1999 and 2007, was Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani, power should rotate clockwise, starting with their zone.\n\nHowever, speaking at the council election campaign rally, Senator Utazi, who represents Enugu North senatorial zone, in aligning with Dr. Nwodo, argued that the geography known today as Enugu State originally comprised two zones, namely Enugu and Nsukka.\n\nHe said former governor of old Anambra State, Senator Jim Nwobodo, used his influence as Minister during the military regime to create Enugu West as an additional senatorial zone out of the old Enugu zone.\n\nIt is recalled that Isi-Uzo LGA was excised from the old Nsukka zone to form Enugu zone comprising. The other LGAs in the zone are Nkanu West, Nkanu East, Enugu East, Enugu South, and Enugu North LGAs.\n\nUtazi argued that since the old Enugu zone had done 16 years through ex-governors Chimaroke and Sullivan Chime, Nsukka zone deserved to produce Ugwuanyi\u2019s successor, who would do another eight consecutive years to equalize the number of years that the old Enugu zone has been at the helms of the state\u2019s affairs.\n\nMeanwhile, the positions of Nwodo and Utazi appear not to have gone down well the people usually destined as core Nkanu, as they gradually started to disperse from campaign, starting with the lines of a governorship hopeful and business mogul from Nkanu East LGA in Enugu East zone, Chief Everest Nnaji.\n\nNkanuland and social media platforms were unusual quite and a ghost of themselves.\n\nAttempts to get reactions from PDP leaders in Enugu East zone, have however proved abortive.\n\nHowever, a chieftain of the party from the zone, who prefers not to have his name in print said he lacked words to describe what came from Nwodo and Utazi.\n\n\u201cMy brother, I have been in politics since God knows when, but I have never received this kind of shock. It was a bombshell.\n\n\u201cIf Nwodo and Utazi spoke for themselves, it would have been easy to digest and contain. But they were clearly the voice of Esau, but the hand belongs to Jacob.\n\n\u201cBy micro-zoning the governoship position to Isi-Uzo, Nwodo was indirectly making a case for an aspirant whom everyone knows to be both his in-law and direct governor\u2019s relation\u201d.\n\nHe said some things were beginning to make sense to Nkanu people.\n\n\u201cNow we know why \u2018Ka Isi-Uzo Her\u2019, a political pressure group canvassing the emergence of an Isi-Uzo man as the next governor was given a larger stand in each of the 14 or so LGAs we have campaigned in so far.\n\n\u201cThe appearance with of a certain commissioner from Isi-Uzo with Ugwuanyi in all the LGAs where we have campaigned so far is also making sense now\u201d, he stated.\n\nPolitical observers are waiting to see how heavyweights like ex-Governor Nnamani, who has been canvassing the emergence of his former Chief of Staff, Mr. Peter Mbah as the next governor would react to the development.\n\nHe had also recently issued a statement, saying it was the tradition of the state and prerogative of Ugwuanyi to anoint his preferred successor and every member of the party and Enugu State would fall in line.\n\nHowever, his statement attracted widespread criticism, with Enugu indigenes in Diaspora also joining the fray.\n\nMany Enugu citizens, including those in Diaspora clamouring for the best hands, basing their position on the fact that all three senatorial zones have now occupied the governoship position, adding that Enugu and the South East need their best hands going forward.\n\nEnugu State indigenes in the Diaspora, said the idea of \u2018anointing\u2019 a successor has not helped the development of the state.\n\nChairman, Enugu State People in the Diaspora, Nze Arinze Onuora, who stated this in a chat with newsmen, recently, said they would mobilise the people against the imposition of a governorship candidate on the state in 2023.\n\nHe insisted that competency should determine the next governor of the state so that Enugu could move away from what he described as \u201cprimordial politics.\u201d\n\nThe people chided former governors Jim Nwobodo and Chimaroke Nnamani for championing the call, even as they expressed disappointment that those, who should be fathers and exposed were the ones creating disharmony in the issue of anointing a successor.\n\nOnuora said: \u201cEnugu people in the Diaspora are interested in ensuring that the right person is elected as governor of the state in 2023 and beyond. Some of us resident abroad are not happy with the situation in the state. Countries abroad are very organised, but the situation is totally different at home.\u201d\n\nCiting various comments credited to Nwobodo and Nnamani, he insisted the thinking that it was Ugwuanyi\u2019s prerogative to choose his successor was wrong and regrettable.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like rotation or zoning abroad, things are done based on competence and merit. That\u2019s the benchmark of everything.\n\n\u201cWe are focusing on getting someone who is competent to govern Enugu State and not zoning. Even if my brother wants to contest the governorship and I know he is not competent, I can\u2019t support him,\u201d he stated.",

The answer may probably be found in the Rule book or Constitution of ASUU.\n\n\u201cAs a registered trade union under the Trade Union Act, its Rule book neither contains any clause conferring powers of certification of academic titles nor the power to declare one illegal,\u201d he stressed.\n\nOn whether Pantami was qualified for the appointment while serving as minister, Abugu called such argument \u201cwatery\u201d and based on ignorance.\n\nThe don listed Ndi Okereke-Onyuike, Ngozi Osarenren, Olakunle Abdul-Rasheed Lawal, Ige Bolodeoku, Musibau Babatunde as prominent citizens who became professors while in government.\n\nThe Senior Advocate Nigeria (SAN) added that Pantami\u2019s rank was legitimately earned and that ASUU\u2019s take on the integrity of the procedure has \u201cno basis in law, precedent, morality and logic\u201d.",

I have already scheduled to visit other countries in Europe, to convince the holders to return them.\u201d\n\nWhile receiving the artifacts, Oba of Benin, whose speech was presented by his younger brother, Prince Aghatise Erediauwa, stated that the artifacts transcend mere art, but mostly of religious significance, while the two bronzes would return to where they rightly belonged.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are witnessing today the beginning of the restitution of our artifacts, which were looted in 1897. Contrary to reports that the military expedition of 1897 was a retaliation for the killing of some British soldiers, the truth is that there was a calculated and a deliberately conceived plan to attack Benin for its territorial dominance and also for her treasures.\n\n\u201cThe result was a destruction of a civilisation, which equalled or even surpassed that of the aggressors. It was thought that the kingdom (Benin), totally decimated and in ruins in the aftermath of the war, would not rise again. By the grace of God and our ancestors, we are still standing.\u201d\n\nThe Benin monarch also hailed President Buhari for taking keen interest in the repatriation of the artifacts, while pleading with persons who were genuinely interested in the cause to join him, in the interest of peace, tranquility and the substance of Benin cultural heritage.",

This was just as Rivers State governor, Nyesome Wike, pledged his full support for the party in order to help it win the by-elections fixed for February 26. Wike was a Special guest of honour at the party\u2019s rally on Saturday.\n\nImpressed by the huge crowd that attended the rally in the state capital and the fact that they defied an attempt by the Police to stop the rally, Wike declared that he was convinced that the PDP was still firmly rooted in the state. \u201cBe rest assured that I will give the PDP in the state my full support to ensure you win in the by-election and in 2023 elections. Don\u2019t allow APC intimidate you.\u201d\n\nHe said it was unfortunate and shameful for anyone to try to intimidate members of PDP by using security operatives to stop a rally for ordinary federal and state constituency by-elections. Wike added that any government that had done well would not use such a gimmick in its bid to stop a rally unless they were not confident or had not done well for the people. He alleged that the ruling APC was afraid of signing the electoral bill into law because they were afraid of transmission of results and the level of transparency the act would guarantee.\n\nHis words : \u201cWhy on earth will they try stop an ordinary rally if they have done well, this is just by- elections for federal and state constituency ,what if it was the governorship ,what would they have done ? If they had succeeded in stopping us from holding the rally, that would have been the end of the party in Cross River ,but we are very resilient people.\n\n\u201c2023 is not 2019 ,PDP means business ,we are taking over Cross River State , go out and get your PVCs ,make sure you vote and also make sure you guide and protect your vote, it is obvious that you are ready to take over Cross River once again. Do not be afraid ,they tried it in Rivers State , but we resisted them , it is just a form of intimidation , I thought the only way to test the people is to allow them to hold their rally whether they would come or not ,but with the crowd here ,it shows that things are not well with them ( APC).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cWith the by- elections, they will know and understand that it is no longer business as usual ,indeed we will leave no stone unturned , we must defeat APC, forget about presidential ambition we must win this first ,\u201d he said. Speaking earlier the Chairman of PDP in Cross River, Venatius Ikem Esq, expressed satisfaction over the patience by party stalwarts adding that they tried to stop them but it did not work.\n\n\u201cThey tried to stop us but they could not, we have mobilised , we are ready for the elections, nobody can stop us ,nobody can intimidate us ,\u201d he said .

The blind can see the developments going on in Lagos and the determination of the governor to consolidate on the THEMES Agenda. The governor has been wonderful and we are seeing progress across all sectors.\n\n\u201cGiven the governor\u2019s outstanding performance, the Body of Christ in Lagos State is saying unequivocally that one good turn deserves another.

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nPresenting the returned artifacts to the monarch at his Palace in Benin City, Amb. Tunji Ishola, said they were at the palace on the express mandate of President Muhammadu Buhari to personally present the items to the Oba of Benin.\n\n\u201cI must say I am here just for one assignment. I am directed by Muhammadu Buhari, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. My assignment is very simple, to directly bring these objects to Oba of Benin Kingdom. That is the presidential directive\u201d, he said.\n\nAppealing to the people of the great Benin Kingdom to join hands with the Oba to preserve the artifacts as they were preserved for 125 years since they were looted from the kingdom, Ishola said the Cockerel is placed at \u00a32 million and the bronze head of the Oba is \u00a3500,000.\n\n\u201cI want to thank British Government for preserving the artifacts to still be in the same form they were when they were taken in 1897.\n\n\u201cNot only that, value has been added to these artifacts. As at today, the Cockerel is valued at \u00a32m in Great Britain and it is brought back here. Oba Head also value at \u00a3500,000 in Great Britain, and it is also brought back here\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Director-General, National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Abba Tijani, said the commission has been at the forefront, pushing for the repatriation of all stolen artifacts back to their original owners.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

Wale Raji, Mrs. Yetunde Imolehin and Mr. Ofonmbuk Okon Bassey.\n\nThere were moves by some chieftains of the party to postpone the primary in order to address the rift between Oyetola and Aregbesola, but the national body resisted the moves.\n\nIncidentally, AbdulRazaq has been engaged in a feud with the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, just like the case between Oyetola and Aregbesola.\n\nBut AbdulRazaq promised all contestants that he would be fair to them in the conduct of the primary election.\n\nHe said he would act in strict compliance with APC\u2019s Constitution in the conduct of the election.\n\nThe governor said he and other members of the panel on the Osun primary were looking forward to conducting a free and fair primary election in the state.\n\nOyetola has persistently resisted Aregbesola\u2019s moves to operate as the Godfather of Osun State politics and dictate to him as the governor, on the day to day running of the state.\n\nThis has resulted in numerous violent clashes among supporters of the two camps.\n\nThe Special Adviser to Oyetola on Political Affairs, Sunday Akere, explains further: \u201cOyetola did not fight Aregbesola. He (Aregbesola) declared that Oyetola\u2019s tenure was his third term and he wanted to be in charge. He also promised those close to him that 80 per cent of them would return as cabinet members, which did not happen. The ex-governor thought the eight-year tenure was for eternity. It has ended but he could not believe that reality. The root cause of the issue is what I just said.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, Elders\u2019 Caucus of the Osun State APC, Sola Akinwumi described the \u201cstreet shows\u201d by Aregbesola as a display of thuggery and hooliganism.\n\nAkinwumi adds: \u201cAs a matter of fact, the erstwhile governor belittles himself and I am very sure he didn\u2019t know the implications of what he did. He acted so low and naively as if he was the sitting governor.\n\n\u201cWas he telling us that there are two governors in the State? Has he forgotten that he is no longer a Governor? We have known his intention and we leave everyone to his or her conscience.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, members of the APC in Osun State have been urged to remain focused and resolute in their resolve to re-elect Oyetola at the party\u2019s primary election coming up today, as they have demonstrated during the strategic tour conducted round the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government, Prince Oluwole Oyebamiji gave the charge in a press statement, describing the atmosphere of tension recently created in the State as a mere distraction.\n\nThe SSG affirmed in the statement that Osun \u201cis the most peaceful state and will remain so during and after the primary election.\u201d\n\nHe then urged every member of the public to embrace peace and go about their lawful duties without any fear.\n\nThe statement further revealed that the Oyetola administration had touched lives and impacted the society in an unprecedented way without relegating human capital development to the background.\n\nAregbesola: Oyetola Waging War against Me\n\nOn the other hand, Aregbesola alleged that Oyetola had been waging a war against him since becoming the governor.\n\nThe Interior Minister reiterated this in Ikire town last Thursday while addressing a rally held to garner support for Adeoti, his anointed candidate in today\u2019s primaries.\n\nSpeaking in Yoruba, Aregbesola said he pleaded with Oyetola for about two years not to fight him, adding that his successor rejected his advice, which made him call his supporters to salvage the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cI begged him (Oyetola) for two years; I told him that people must not mock us; I told him that he was heading for destruction. I served this state with the whole of my heart; I also positioned Oyetola so that he could succeed me in office.\n\n\u201cWhen we came to this town (Ikire) for his campaign, we were drenched in rain from the Akire\u2019s palace to this place. He got to the office and claimed I am his enemy; those who contested against him during our party primary he pulled closer, while he is fighting me.\n\n\u201cSince Oyetola assumed office, he has waged a war against me as if I once harmed him. He claimed that I did not want him to emerge as the governor; I told him that I heard him and that now that he had been governor, what else did he want?\n\n\u201cI begged him for two years; I sent people to help me beg him and that he should not love me, but he must not fight me; even if he wanted to fight me, he should not abuse me and destroy my legacies.\n\n\u201cAll that I warned him not to do was what he did. He opposed what I did; all the things I did together with him for eight years, he opposed and reversed them. He thought he could destroy me through my work; nobody was pushing him, he is pushing himself. He deliberately towed that path. He waged a war against me and refused to listen to my pleas until he got rid of me.\u201d\n\nSack Aregbesola Now, Coalition Tells Buhari\n\nMeanwhile, a Coalition of Civil Society Organisations in Osun State has demanded the sack of Aregbesola for promoting civil unrest ahead of today\u2019s governorship primary election.\n\nThe Spokesperson of the Coalition, Mr. Wasiu Alli, while addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, said according to the 5th Schedule of the constitution, Aregbesola was expected to act only in ways that promote National Security and does not expose Nigerians anywhere to threats to their lives and property.\n\nThe Coalition added that where the contrary becomes the case, erring government officials must receive appropriate sanctions.\n\nThe coalition said Aregbesola in the past one week had engaged in a public show of rascality, encouragement of followers to behave in manners that undermine the superintendence of the present administration in the State, denigration of Elder Statesmen, among many others.\n\nIt noted that the recent utterances of Aregbesola were already heating the polity in the State to a point where residents now live in fear.\n\nIt stated: \u201cWhile superintending over Security Agencies under the Ministry of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, has now turned security details attached to him by these Agencies (NSCDC and NPF) into tools of political warfare, clearly undermining the jurisdiction of the Nigeria Police Force in maintaining security in Osun State.\n\n\u201cMr. Rauf Aregbesola, despite being responsible for coordination of public security, is, by his actions, promoting disunity and insubordination between two key security agencies that should ordinarily be cooperating. This portends grave danger for the maintenance of peace and security within Osun State and indeed, Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe coalition said if the federal government failed to call Aregbesola to order and charge him to focus on his official responsibilities instead of going about causing civil unrest, he would end up inflaming the otherwise peaceful Osun State.\n\nIt said, \u201cWhere he cannot be cautioned, we demand his outright sack or redeployment if he cannot act responsibly in line with the dictates of the office he presently holds. A public officer must never be seen acting contrary to the spirit and provisions of the Nigerian Constitution.\u201d\n\nResponding, Aregbesola said the Coalition was hurriedly put together and plotted by the leadership of the government in Osun State.\n\nThe minister, who responded in a statement issued by his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure, insisted that the state government in particular had mounted a campaign of calumny against the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) because they were providing security for some citizens in Osun while they hold meetings and ward off attacks against them.\n\nYou Have Been Chosen to Rule Osun for Second Term, Ataoja, Olobu Tell Oyetola\n\nThe Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Oyetunji Olanipekun, and the Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, yesterday reiterated their support for Governor Oyetola, saying they were resolute to work for his success in the forthcoming governorship election.\n\nThe monarchs showered encomiums and prayers on the governor for his modest achievements in the last three years, just as they assured him of their royal backing before, during and after the July 16 governorship election in the State.\n\nThis is even as Oyetola rounded off his strategic engagement tour across the nine Federal Constituencies of the State in Osogbo, the State capital, on Thursday night.\n\nOyetola had in the last three weeks embarked on a familiarisation visit to each of the 30 local government areas, including Ife-East Area Office, to identify and solidarise with the newly-elected executives of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the State.\n\nReceiving the Governor in his palace, the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, threw his weight behind Governor Oyetola whom he described as a promise keeper.\n\nIn the same vein, Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, acknowledged the monumental achievements of the Administration of Governor Oyetola, which he described as unprecedented in the history of the State.\n\nOba Olaniyan, who implored the Governor to remain steadfast and not be distracted, said, \u201cWe are solidly behind you and we are ready to mobilise our subjects to re-elect you.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The Caretaker Committee and the governors will meet with the President on Saturday (today) to propose the new date.\u201d\n\nAlso, a former member of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who pleaded for anonymity, said it was already clear that the convention would not hold, \u201cbecause there are some things that needed to be done for the convention to hold as scheduled on February 26 and most of them had not been done, with few days to February 26.\u201d\n\nThe source stressed that, for instance, one of the things that ought to have been done was zoning of party offices.\n\nHe continued: \u201cPeople have not bought forms and people cannot buy form if the zoning is not done; and forms cannot come out until the zoning is done. That is when aspirants will know what kind of forms they are buying. If you don\u2019t know the zoning, you can\u2019t buy a form.\n\n\u201cThere are no committees; all the sub-committees have not been set up as we speak. I remember that at the last convention, there were over 20 committees beside the main convention committee.\u201d\n\nReacting to the purported plans by some governors and a principal officer in the Senate to foist Senator Abdulahi Adamu on the party, he said \u201cwhile individuals or groups can have preference, President Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on who becomes the next Chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cWhatever you are hearing now are mere speculations because nobody can push anybody. All of them are waiting for the president. Everybody is waiting for the president and that is why until the president says this is the chairman before they can now zone other positions around where he comes from.\n\n\u201cSo, they have to know whom; they have to know which zone he is from before they can now zone the remaining offices based on that.

          "title": "WHO Names Nigeria among Six African Countries to Receive Technology for Production of COVID-19 Vaccine",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has named Nigeria and five other African countries \u2013 Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Kenya and Tunisia \u2013 as the first in Africa that would receive the technology needed for the manufacturing of mRNA (Messenger Ribonuclieic Acid) used in producing COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nGhebreyesus who announced this yesterday at the European Union \u2013 African Union summit in Brussels said the countries all applied and were selected as recipients.\n\nThe announcement was made at a ceremony hosted by the European Council, France, South Africa and WHO in the presence of President Macron, President Ramaphosa, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nThe mRNA vaccines are different from most vaccines which contain a weakened or inactive piece of the target virus which triggers the production of antibodies.\n\nInstead these game-changing type of vaccines use laboratory engineering mRNA that give cells instructions on how to create a protein that resembles a piece of a protein found in the virus of concern \u2014 COVID-19 in this case.\n\nThis triggers the body to create antibodies to deactivate the foreign protein. The antibodies then linger in the body to fight subsequent infection from COVID-19. This technology is used in the production of Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines.\n\nGhebreyesus said the COVID-19 pandemic had shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods was limiting and dangerous.\n\nWith the addition of Nigeria to the four countries earlier approved for the vaccine production on the continent, efforts by the Buhari administration to change the selection that the country considered unrepresentative of the needs, capabilities and population distribution in Africa has thus yielded the desired result.\n\nPresident Buhari has since welcomed the development.\n\nIn his contribution at the Roundtable on Health Systems and Vaccine Production at the ongoing 6th Europe-Africa Summit in Brussels, Belgium yesterday, Buhari called for a closer collaboration with the EU to tackle the effects of the pandemic on the African continent.\n\nHe expressed delight at receiving the news of the selection of Nigeria among recipients of mRNA Vaccine technology transfer.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cWe shall ensure the best use is made of the opportunity. Nigeria also offers to host the Bio-manufacturing Training hub proposed by World Health Organisation (WHO). We commit to providing support to make the hub functional in the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the efforts of the foreign partners in making the Covid-19 vaccine available, he urged them to do more as less than 10 per cent of the African population had gotten the jab, stressing that this situation could negatively affect Africa\u2019s developmental projections.\n\n\u201cIn the mid- to long-term, the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need, with equitable access as their primary endpoint,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nResponding to the announcement, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said: \u201cThis is an initiative that will allow us to make our own vaccines and that, to us, is very important. It means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent.\u201d\n\nThe global mRNA technology transfer hub was established in 2021 to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.\n\nAlso French President, Emmanuel Macron said: \u201cImproved public health benefits, supporting African health sovereignty and economic development are the principal goals of strengthening local production in Africa. In an interconnected world, we need stronger and new partnerships between countries, development partners and other stakeholders to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time.\u201d\n\nOn his part, President of the European Council, Charles Michel said the world needed to create an environment where every scientist, health worker, and government can band together for a common cause by working together \u201cto build new solutions to protect what is most precious \u2013 our health and our lives.\u201d He said the initiative will ensure that all countries build the necessary capacity to produce their own vaccines and other health technologies.\n\nThe WHO mRNA technology transfer hub is part of a larger effort aimed at empowering low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Oba Of Benin In Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence To Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 In Prison For Months, Denies Him Bail Over Allegation Of Stealing",
          "text": "The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho \u2013 a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on \u201cpalace instructions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.\n\n\u201cSo everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,\u201d a source said.\n\n\"It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don\u2019t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.\n\n\"Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.\n\n\n\n\"They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son\u2019s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.\n\n\"They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.\n\nHe was charged with stealing and conspiracy\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.\n\n\u201cHow is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.\n\n\"Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn\u2019t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it\u2019s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.\n\n\u201cThe state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing. Seemingly they\u2019ve all been bought over. His lawyer later suggested that we should go for an appeal for the bail and charge an outrageous sum of N1 million,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the palace aide now 20 years old (to turn 21 this year), wrote some notes while in remand, detailing how his ordeal at the Oba of Benin\u2019s palace started.\n\nHe is being remanded in Oko correctional centre in Benin City.\n\n\n\nIn the notes written by the accused while in prison, and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, Nelson said, \u201cBefore reading this book, things you need to know; one, I have been serving the King (Oba Ewuare II) for five years plus. I have been serving without off day, break or relaxation time. I work 365 or 366 days a year.\n\n\u201cI am not on any payroll, I don\u2019t receive any salary. My family don\u2019t get any benefit or compensation. They haven\u2019t received anything from the palace. My education got tampered with since I got to the palace because the school is not functioning well and no proper equipment or lab. I was over-laboured.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have fixed working hours. Sometimes I do work from morning (6am) till midnight (12am); sometimes till dawn. I don\u2019t have time for myself because I was occupied. I was being maltreated. I have photo proof. I was always beaten and threatened every day. I was just waiting for the whole issue to die so I can leave because it was becoming more unbearable. I called my parents and I explained everything to them; I even told my friends. They all advised me to just bear that maybe everything will soon be over.\n\n\u201cIt all started when an issue arose on May 15, 2021, about some missing cash in the King (Oba Ewuare\u2019s) inner chamber. I happen to be one of the close aides to him. So one of my colleagues, Bright, was detained on that same day; May 15 for questioning.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile I was still doing my daily routine without knowing how the whole matter was going. I was beaten and threatened to confess about my colleague (Bright) that I saw him taking the money. But I refused to do so because I never saw him taking the money. Truth be told, it wasn\u2019t very easy; I couldn\u2019t run because they would falsely accuse me. Though I kept on complaining to the person that brought me (Rowland), he kept telling me to keep calm that I can run when everything is over. He told me everyone will conclude I am the one who took the money if I run.\n\n\u201cOn May 31, Rowland told me that I was going to the State Criminal Investigation Department to write a statement that Bright mentioned my name in his statement ad I was really confused because I don\u2019t even know what he was talking about. So I walked up to his car and entered there. I heard a lot of rumour that police can torture you and you will start confessing what you didn\u2019t do. I was really scared.\n\n\u201cThen I asked Rowland if I could go home from the police station because all I wanted in my life was freedom. So I told Rowland I was going to confess that I saw Bright and Igwe coming out from the inner chamber with brown envelope but I don\u2019t know what was inside; that they gave me some cash later that day not to tell anyone I saw them.\n\n\u201cThe story was made up, no incident like that ever occurred. I wanted to get myself involved so I will be chased from the palace and I see that as the only way to freedom. So Rowland drove me to the State CID with two bouncers who they were going to detain too. We met the Commander, anti-cultist unit and I wrote my statement in his office. I was surprised that after writing the statement, Rowland left me there and I was detained on May 31, 2021. At first, I thought Rowland was going to inform the king so that I would be sent home as we both agreed. But I never heard from him for more than a week. I waited for weeks but he never showed up but kept giving excuses when called.\n\n\u201cI was detained for two months, a week and a day. (May 31 to August 8, 2021); my parents never visited nor called to check up on me. It was my girlfriend that kept on bringing food to me. It wasn\u2019t really easy though.\n\n\u201cNote that my parents\u2019 property; a house on 100 by 100 and extra land were seized by the palace even before investigations started. The properties have not been returned yet.\n\n\u201cSo after being detained again on October 25, 2021, we were charged to court. We were taken to a High Court for a stealing case. We were remanded in Oko Prison on October 26, 2021, as awaiting trial persons.\n\n\u201cSo on a fateful day, we were called for a visit by some prison wardens that there were some visitors from the palace. On getting there, we saw Dennis Osaretin, Oyaniyen and one other palace functionary who I assume the palace sent to check to see if we were really suffering.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is Christmas and I am still in prison; worst Christmas ever not for me though because I always celebrate it without going out or having fun but it\u2019s actually the worst Christmas for my family. How are they going to celebrate Christmas knowing their son, brother is in prison? Don\u2019t really know how they feel now but I still give thanks to GOD.\u201d\n\nFrank Irabor, Secretary of Benin Traditional Council, told SaharaReporters that the monarch is too big to respond to such allegations, especially as the matter is in court.\n\n\"I don't understand the case you are talking about, the case is in court, do you want Omo n'Oba (Oba of Benin) to react to that?\n\n\"If someone is detained, even for one year, that is at the discretion of the judge or the agency handling the case. They will want to continue to remand the person, maybe to conclude their investigation.\n\n\"They should not drag Omo n'Oba into it at all; he is too big for that. So there is no need to say the palace or the secretary should react. Let the court handle it. Please, he is too big for that,\" Irabor said.\n\nOba of Benin in Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence to Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 in... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Oba Of Benin In Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence To Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 In Prison For Months, Denies Him Bail Over Allegation Of Stealing",
          "text": "The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho \u2013 a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on \u201cpalace instructions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.\n\n\u201cSo everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,\u201d a source said.\n\n\"It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don\u2019t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.\n\n\"Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.\n\n\n\n\"They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son\u2019s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.\n\n\"They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.\n\nHe was charged with stealing and conspiracy\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.\n\n\u201cHow is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.\n\n\"Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn\u2019t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it\u2019s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.\n\n\u201cThe state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing. Seemingly they\u2019ve all been bought over. His lawyer later suggested that we should go for an appeal for the bail and charge an outrageous sum of N1 million,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the palace aide now 20 years old (to turn 21 this year), wrote some notes while in remand, detailing how his ordeal at the Oba of Benin\u2019s palace started.\n\nHe is being remanded in Oko correctional centre in Benin City.\n\n\n\nIn the notes written by the accused while in prison, and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, Nelson said, \u201cBefore reading this book, things you need to know; one, I have been serving the King (Oba Ewuare II) for five years plus. I have been serving without off day, break or relaxation time. I work 365 or 366 days a year.\n\n\u201cI am not on any payroll, I don\u2019t receive any salary. My family don\u2019t get any benefit or compensation. They haven\u2019t received anything from the palace. My education got tampered with since I got to the palace because the school is not functioning well and no proper equipment or lab. I was over-laboured.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have fixed working hours. Sometimes I do work from morning (6am) till midnight (12am); sometimes till dawn. I don\u2019t have time for myself because I was occupied. I was being maltreated. I have photo proof. I was always beaten and threatened every day. I was just waiting for the whole issue to die so I can leave because it was becoming more unbearable. I called my parents and I explained everything to them; I even told my friends. They all advised me to just bear that maybe everything will soon be over.\n\n\u201cIt all started when an issue arose on May 15, 2021, about some missing cash in the King (Oba Ewuare\u2019s) inner chamber. I happen to be one of the close aides to him. So one of my colleagues, Bright, was detained on that same day; May 15 for questioning.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile I was still doing my daily routine without knowing how the whole matter was going. I was beaten and threatened to confess about my colleague (Bright) that I saw him taking the money. But I refused to do so because I never saw him taking the money. Truth be told, it wasn\u2019t very easy; I couldn\u2019t run because they would falsely accuse me.

He told me everyone will conclude I am the one who took the money if I run.\n\n\u201cOn May 31, Rowland told me that I was going to the State Criminal Investigation Department to write a statement that Bright mentioned my name in his statement ad I was really confused because I don\u2019t even know what he was talking about. So I walked up to his car and entered there. I heard a lot of rumour that police can torture you and you will start confessing what you didn\u2019t do. I was really scared.\n\n\u201cThen I asked Rowland if I could go home from the police station because all I wanted in my life was freedom. So I told Rowland I was going to confess that I saw Bright and Igwe coming out from the inner chamber with brown envelope but I don\u2019t know what was inside; that they gave me some cash later that day not to tell anyone I saw them.\n\n\u201cThe story was made up, no incident like that ever occurred. I wanted to get myself involved so I will be chased from the palace and I see that as the only way to freedom. So Rowland drove me to the State CID with two bouncers who they were going to detain too. We met the Commander, anti-cultist unit and I wrote my statement in his office. I was surprised that after writing the statement, Rowland left me there and I was detained on May 31, 2021. At first, I thought Rowland was going to inform the king so that I would be sent home as we both agreed. But I never heard from him for more than a week.

          "text": "When the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) declared \u201cSuper Cop\u201d Abba Kyari wanted on Monday following his alleged involvement with an international drug cartel, I was very happy. Very, very happy. But my joy had nothing to do with Kyari, the deputy commissioner of police already indicted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the case involving Ramon Abbas aka Hushpuppi, the self-confessed international fraudster. For sure, I was glad to learn that the obviously highly connected police officer was reportedly caught on video in what appears to be a sting operation by the NDLEA. That means we should at least have an interesting case in court.\n\nMy joy, rather, was how far Brig-Gen Mohamed Buba Marwa (rtd) has gone in transforming the NDLEA in just one year as chairman. Suddenly, it is as if the NDLEA is a brand-new agency, whereas it was set up 32 years ago by the government of Gen Ibrahim Babangida, with Mr Fidelis Oyakhilome, a deputy inspector general of police, serving as the pioneer chairman. It was initially named National Drug Enforcement Agency (like the US Drug Enforcement Agency) but Nigerian grammar guards argued that \u201cyou don\u2019t enforce drug; you enforce the law against drugs\u201d. Oyakhilome left in disgrace in 1991 after a scandal involving him, his lady friend, the late Jennifer Madike, and drug barons.\n\nAlthough the agency has had ten chief executives, I am inclined to say no chairman has had as much impact within such a short period as Marwa. According to insiders, the first thing Marwa did was internal re-organisation. He also effected long-due promotions and cleared the backlog of allowances in the perennially underfunded agency. He ramped up intelligence-led operations across the country. With a motivated workforce, the result has been the unprecedented spate of arrests and drug seizures. The agency has also heightened public enlightenment campaigns on the dangers of drug use. I have no hesitation whatsoever in celebrating these wins in this season of despair.\n\nI must at this point admit that I am by no means surprised that Marwa has raised the bar \u2014 yet again \u2014 in public service. He is kicking asses in the war against illicit drugs. I have been following his career since 1990 when he was appointed military governor of Borno state (now Borno and Yobe) by Babangida. I recall that he set up the first joint military patrol in the country, codenamed Operation Zaki, to tackle insecurity. Borno had been at the mercy of cross-boundary banditry. Chadian rebels fighting President Idriss D\u00e9by \u2014 who had just overthrown Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 \u2014 started raiding Borno villages, similar to the current situation in the north. Marwa impressively contained the bandits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorno residents started sleeping well, further helped by the fact that Marwa also did quite some job in education, agriculture and infrastructure. He built roads using direct labour to save costs. The good-looking young officer, barely 38, was setting standards in public administration. His governor colleagues across the country started taking their cue from him, and in no time joint military patrols to tackle insecurity and cost-saving direct labour for road rehabilitation became a trend. In 1991, also under his stewardship, El-Kanemi Warriors FC became the first team from the far north to win the FA Cup (now Fed Cup/Aiteo Cup) since 1953. Incidentally, that was the year he was born.\n\nMarwa soon travelled abroad on military posting as defence attach\u00e9 at the Nigerian permanent mission to the UN. In 1996, he resurfaced in Nigeria when he was appointed the military administrator of Lagos state by Gen Sani Abacha, then head of state. It was tricky. At the time, the south-west was still on fire as a result of the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election by Babangida. Bashorun MKO Abiola, the winner, had been arrested and detained by Abacha for seeking to reclaim his mandate. Lagos was the epicentre of the uprising against military rule, with NADECO, Afenifere and other activist groups making life unbearable for the government.\n\nAppointing a Fulani from Adamawa state as governor of Lagos state at the height of bitter anti-north sentiments did not look like a smart move on the part of Abacha, but, amazingly, Marwa became the darling of Lagosians. The state had been gripped by insecurity, with armed robbers roaming freely, audaciously knocking on the doors of residents and seizing their belongings without let or hinderance. Marwa introduced Operation Sweep, a joint military patrol, and the pervasive insecurity was quickly brought under control. Although the soldiers were also widely accused of extra-judicial execution of suspects, the consensus was that Lagos was a much safer place under Marwa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot to forget how he tackled the \u201carea boys\u201d menace: taking them off the streets, rehabilitating them and making them undergo entrepreneurial training. Many of them became artisans and factory hands. Some went into small-scale businesses and I recall once eating what we called \u201carea boys\u2019 bread\u201d. Many were engaged by the state\u2019s direct labour agency and deployed in the reconstruction of the Mile 2-Ikorodu road, although you wouldn\u2019t compare the quality with Julius Berger\u2019s. Unfortunately, the rehabilitation of area boys did not endure as Nigeria transited to civil rule and the street urchins came back in full force till this day, primarily for the purpose of elections.\n\nLagosians celebrated Marwa for the massive reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads, coming on the heels of years of neglect blamed on lack of bitumen by the previous administrator. Marwa not only sourced for the elusive bitumen, he set up a factory to produce the hydrocarbon. Armed with two postgraduate degrees \u2014 Master of Public and International Affairs from the University of Pittsburgh (1983-85) and Master of Public Administration from the Harvard Kennedy School (1985-86) \u2014 and demonstrating a high emotional intelligence governing what was thought to be enemy\u2019s territory, he did much in his three years to contribute a decent quota to the state\u2019s development.\n\nHaving said all these beautiful things about Marwa\u2019s impressive output as NDLEA chairman and his record of competence, I now need to throw in a word of caution: General, watch your back. Going after Kyari and his alleged cohorts may be desirable and commendable as Marwa seems determined to ensure that there are no sacred cows, but I hope the powers that be will not end up making a mincemeat of the NDLEA chairman. There has been an established pattern under the Buhari administration since 2019: many of those working extra time to fight the rot in the system end up in the trashcan. The evidence is too damning for any change enthusiast to ignore or downplay.\n\nThe latest victim is Ms Hadiza Bala Usman, who has just been officially removed as the MD of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). While on duty, she put up a spirited fight against many enemies of Nigeria\u2019s progress \u2014 the entrenched interests working round-the-clock to foist fraudulent agreements on Nigeria, to pillage the national treasury without remorse. She courageously refused to take the easiest way out; that is, play ball. She needed all the political backing she could get as she was being bullied and battered. Rather, she was mercilessly flung out of the window. That is her reward. But she should still be thankful that the trumped-up allegation of fraud was thrown out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Hadiza, there was Ms Yewande Sadiku. She also tasted the bitter pills of pushback by the forces holding Nigeria hostage. Their parish at the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) tried to wrestle her to the ground, but she gave them a bloodied nose \u2014 in the absence of political backing from a government preaching \u201cchange\u201d. The enemies of progress fought back in equal measure, adopting the usual tactics, including frivolously petitioning three agencies and taking her to court. Yewande headbutted them all. She came out untainted but her tenure was never going to be renewed. You don\u2019t fight corruption, waste and indiscipline in Nigeria and expect medals.\n\nThe biggest victim without competition is Mr Ibrahim Magu who, like orange, was squeezed, sucked and dumped by this administration in the most exhilarating manner. From 2015 to 2019, the biggest thing President Buhari counted as his achievement was the war against corruption and the recovery of looted funds. While I was a critic of Magu\u2019s EFCC for the highhandedness and lop-sidedness, the truth is that he was the poster boy of this administration locally and internationally. He must now be living in regret as he vegetates after getting the boot unceremoniously. Up till today, we have not been told why he was removed. He will retire in May 2022 a sad, broken man. That is his reward.\n\nCan you now understand why I am advising Marwa to be careful with Kyari? I love Marwa very much. He is an intelligent and result-driven public administrator with a record of service that only a few Nigerians can rival, but I am inclined to advise him to watch his back. Remember Kyari was suspended after the Hushpuppi indictment but nobody touched him thereafter. All the previous complaints against him were ignored. That says a lot about his connections. I am by no means saying Marwa should slow down or surrender, but he should know that he is now stepping on big toes. When the chips are down, he may be hung out to dry \u2014 as we just saw with Hadiza at NPA.\n\nI am not in any sense asking courageous Nigerians in public office not to do their job. Far from it. If anything, my hope is renewed in Nigeria whenever I think of what the likes of Marwa, Hadiza, Yewande, Waziri Adio and many others have done in public service. I come across patriotic and competent Nigerians home and abroad all the time and my heart is gladdened. We have more than enough ingredients to make Nigeria great. Our biggest problem is that we are a sheepfold without a shepherd. The day we manage to have the right shepherd at the helm, our development will be so accelerated it would be hard to believe that it is the same Nigeria. Yes, a new Nigeria is possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026.\n\nBURNING MONEY\n\nPresident Buhari has sent a supplementary budget of N2.55trn to the national assembly. To fund education? No. To fund public hospitals? No. To build more roads? No. To pay for consumption of petrol? Yes. You get it. We want to \u201cprotect the poor\u201d. The entire bill is estimated at N3trn, so the states and councils will pick the rest. This is a country that is borrowing to do virtually everything. At this rate, we will soon start borrowing to pay our debts. Ironically, the bleeding obvious is that we are subsidising the consumption of petrol in other countries as well as feeding the potbellies of those exaggerating the smuggling figures. But we say that we are protecting the poor. Damned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFLYING SHAME\n\nOn Thursday evening, I was at the Benin Airport. Mosquitoes treated me with so much disrespect. The ACs did not work. The toilets had no tissue. At the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, the conveyor belts are simultaneously undergoing repairs, and I suppose this is unique to Nigeria. MMIA\u2019s ACs often struggle to work. One sign that you are approaching security checks on arrival is the stench from the nearby toilets. The state of many Nigerian airports is a crying shame. We do certain things in this country that make it look like we are deliberately trying to advertise our mediocrity and incompetence to the whole world as if there is a trophy to be won. Shameful!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPAID VACATION\n\nAnd so, university teachers are set to embark on what the peerless Dr Chidi Amuta calls \u201cpaid vacation\u201d. The routine strikes are usually framed as a struggle to \u201csave\u201d university education in Nigeria. Yeah, right. Certainly, there are structural and funding issues that need to be tackled creatively and decisively, but why strike is always a popular line of action is obvious: you teach, you get paid; you don\u2019t teach, you get paid. It\u2019s a perverse incentive. We need to study the irreparable damage strikes do to the intellectual and social progress of our youths. While government should take most of the blame, ASUU members also need to look at themselves in the mirror. Regressive.\n\nPASSPORT TO SENSE\n\nSolutions to some problems don\u2019t require rocket science. Just common sense. The Nigerian embassy in Germany has visited Cologne to issue passports to Nigerian nationals, who typically had to travel to either Berlin or Munich for the service. This is not only time-consuming but could be very uncomfortable. Kudos to Hon Yusuf Tuggar, Nigeria\u2019s ambassador to Germany, for this initiative. He said more German cities are on the cards. Nigerians in the US can testify to the pains they often endure to travel for hours or days and lodge in hotels just to process their passports. I hope our other embassies will learn from this. Application of common sense can solve big problems. Fact.",

We do certain things in this country that make it look like we are deliberately trying to advertise our mediocrity and incompetence to the whole world as if there is a trophy to be won. Shameful!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPAID VACATION\n\nAnd so, university teachers are set to embark on what the peerless Dr Chidi Amuta calls \u201cpaid vacation\u201d. The routine strikes are usually framed as a struggle to \u201csave\u201d university education in Nigeria. Yeah, right. Certainly, there are structural and funding issues that need to be tackled creatively and decisively, but why strike is always a popular line of action is obvious: you teach, you get paid; you don\u2019t teach, you get paid. It\u2019s a perverse incentive. We need to study the irreparable damage strikes do to the intellectual and social progress of our youths. While government should take most of the blame, ASUU members also need to look at themselves in the mirror. Regressive.\n\nPASSPORT TO SENSE\n\nSolutions to some problems don\u2019t require rocket science. Just common sense. The Nigerian embassy in Germany has visited Cologne to issue passports to Nigerian nationals, who typically had to travel to either Berlin or Munich for the service. This is not only time-consuming but could be very uncomfortable. Kudos to Hon Yusuf Tuggar, Nigeria\u2019s ambassador to Germany, for this initiative. He said more German cities are on the cards. Nigerians in the US can testify to the pains they often endure to travel for hours or days and lodge in hotels just to process their passports. I hope our other embassies will learn from this. Application of common sense can solve big problems. Fact.",

          "text": "Pan-African fintech firm Flutterwave on Friday announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard as well as the addition of small business lending, fintech-as-a-service (FaaS), and more to its suite of offerings.\n\nThe announcement comes 2 days after Flutterwave confirmed it had raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion. Led by founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, the company facilitates cross-border payments transactions of small-to-large businesses in Africa via one API.\n\nIn a virtual event themed \u201cFlutterwave 3.0\u201d, Africa\u2019s most valuable startup and payments giant rolled out a series of products and services including FaaS services for embedded finance, SME loans for its users, card issuance for a wide array of clients while announcing the addition of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlutterwave Capital, the new SME loans product, is offered in partnership with the company\u2019s lending partners\u2014CashConnect Microfinance Bank, MoneyWise Microfinance Bank, Wema Bank, Zenith Bank, Stanbic IBTC Bank, and Sterling Bank.\n\nThe new product will enable businesses \u201ceasily access loans without collateral, cumbersome documentation, and other stringent terms and conditions,\u201d a blog post on Flutterwave\u2019s website reads, adding that eligible applicants can access the funds they need in less than 2 business days.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave Capital, we\u2019re making it easier for business owners to access the funds they require to grow their businesses. Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases",
          "text": "In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.\n\nThe growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021\u2014its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.\n\nScams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called \u201crug pull\u201d. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.\n\nCryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.\n\nDeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.\n\nDeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth\u20141,964%\u2014for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens\u2014all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.\n\nWhile Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent \u201ctokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges\u201d.\n\nApart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.\n\nIn a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won\u2019t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales\u2014private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized \u00a3180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple\u2019s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Ckrowd\u2019s plan to help African creators monetise their content",
          "text": "The term \u201ccreator economy\u201d became popular throughout 2021 when venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and independent creators not only threw the phrase around but also invested heavily in the content industry\u2014an industry that would leapfrog into becoming a $100 billion industry.\n\nContent creators\u2014writers, artists, social media influencers, videographers, gamers, podcasters\u2014are raking in millions of dollars annually by monetising their craft. But only a tiny fraction of these creators are Africans. This means African creators are still struggling to earn much from their craft, compared to their global counterparts.\n\nTwo things may have caused this: one is, global payment networks like Paypal that should connect African creators with the rest of the world have shut Africans out of their network; secondly, lack or shortage of efficient local creator platforms that connect the rest of the world directly to African creators.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile there are some companies already building to solve the first problem, Ckrowd, a content streaming platform and marketplace, is solving the second problem at scale.\n\nCkrowd is positioning itself as the platform that bridges the gap between African content creators or suppliers and their global content consumers by providing creators with the opportunity to earn income while giving \u201cunique, exclusive, and engaging content experiences to their consumers\u201d.\n\nCkrowd was founded out of a will to do more\n\nCkrowd was founded by Olukayode Adebayo in November 2020. But before then, Adebayo, who was freshly back to Nigeria after a stint with the Nigerian embassy in China, had founded a real estate company that morphed into a hospitality business. He then started a media outfit in September 2016, called KAM Africa.\n\nAt KAM Africa, Adebayo started an initiative that would help creative professionals like musicians and actors understand the business part of their craft. But as he continued with the initiative, he realised that there was a need to bring all these promising enterprises together. Nobody builds in isolation, especially in the entertainment scene. So KAM Africa started Amfest, a festival-like event that brings together African creative businesses.\n\nAdebayo\u2019s cross-continental experience helped Amfest to quickly scale out of its founding country Nigeria into Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and even Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe started building business partnerships with other platforms and scaled very fast. It was in the process of supporting the sector that we found out that many of these talents that are now enterprises had a problem with anything that doesn\u2019t involve physical human interaction,\u201d Adebayo told TechCabal. \u201cAt the point of this discovery, COVID-19 happened and it became even clearer as most of them were left without income. So, there was a need to bring them online.\u201d\n\nThe next thing to build became apparent; Ckrowd\u2014the solution to these persistent problems. After doing a lot of research and consultations throughout 2020, Adebayo launched the beta version of Ckrowd early last year and then launched publicly in August.\n\nHow Ckrowd works\n\nThe platform is a direct-to-consumer platform where original and exclusive African content in education, information, and entertainment is distributed directly to local and global consumers in short videos and live stream format. Think of a marriage between OnlyFans, Patreon, and YouTube\u2014in fact, a combination of all the streaming platforms out there\u2014but now for African content.\n\nLast year in December, uduX, a Nigerian streaming platform, partnered with telecoms giant MTN to live stream Wizkid\u2019s \u201cMade in Lagos\u201d concert from London\u2019s 02 Arena to over 238,000 Africans. But the event was quickly moved to YouTube after the day one of the three-days concert. Regardless of what might have caused the relocation, it\u2019s, however, an indication that Africa needs more efficient indigenous platforms that can aggregate content and put more money in the pocket of local creators while providing a seamless experience for local and global consumers.\n\nFor Adebayo, Ckrowd is taking an all-encompassing approach to building for the African creator economy, one that\u2019s a win-win for all the stakeholders.\n\nTo better understand CKrowd\u2019s advantage, let\u2019s look at how existing streaming platforms work: On YouTube, for instance, creators make money according to their view numbers and sometimes from ads. This means, if YouTube pays $0.0001 per view, you\u2019ll need 10,000 views to make $10. In the case of Netflix, let\u2019s say you subscribe at $10 per month, what happens if you are too busy for Netflix that month? Will you be refunded? No!\n\nFrom the creator\u2019s end, 10,000 views for $10 is not sustainable. How many African creators hit hundreds of thousands of views or millions? A small number. For consumers, the subscription model is not good if you can\u2019t flip unused subscriptions.\n\nOn Ckrowd, creators can livestream their content like uduX live and upload on-demand contents like on Netflix. Creators also control their spaces and how they want to be paid\u2014per view or by subscription. Unlike on social media platforms where creators, after creating content and amassing views and followers, would have to go outside the platform to market their views and followers to brands, Ckrowd lets creators set their prices and make their money as they go. It also allows viewers to select how they wish to pay for content\u2014all inside the platform.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to deliver economic value to African creators. The platform pays 70% of total income on content to creators, which we believe is the highest pay-out on digital content to African creators,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nCkrowd is not only for music and film content; educational, culinary, sports, and other forms of content are allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe Ckrowd platform is similar to a large arena in the cloud where you can broadcast live & short on-demand video content and charge access fees on behalf of the creators of that content. This allows the platform to uniquely function as an edtech, mediatech and adtech hybrid,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nCkrowd, from 4 users at its beta launch, has grown to have over 2,000 users on its platform. Last year in October, it raised $160,000 in pre-seed funding; $60,000 of equity funding, and $100,000 export grant investment from an international angel investor group, as well as backing from the Export Expansion Facility Programme from Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nCkrowd plans to use the new capital to expand with new innovative technologies and strategies to get more customers, accelerate growth and promote intra-African creative industries. In addition to that, the company plans to hire more talent, especially in product, Research and Development (R&D) and engineering.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, the startup has already made headway in some of these plans. It acquired a marketing agency last year to power the ads sector of its business. The company said the agency\u2019s channels had access to about 50 million people across Africa, which means Ckrowd can now reach these people through email, SMS, and other channels available. This sounds like a transfer of data without the consent of the owners; however, if these people opted in with the marketing agency, which has now been acquired, then, by extension, they have opted in with Ckrowd.\n\nThe startup also recently announced the appointment of the founder and director of Music Works International Katherine McVicker and co-founder of Cultural Connections of Africa (CCA) Adeleye Fabusoro as executive members to its advisory board. Adebayo also said the company has built its own production studio and is currently partnering with other media houses across the continent, He hinted that they [Ckrowd] will soon start rolling out the results of the partnerships.\n\nCkrowd is taking on big players like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, ShowMax, uduX and even cable television channel who\u2019ve got their claws deep in the streaming market.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nSolving critical bankend freight industry challenges\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\nSolving critical backend freight industry challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.\n\nFor most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.\n\nOne of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.\n\nPartech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.\n\nHe also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company\u2019s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.\n\nThe round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.\n\nNonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.\n\nEarnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMost people with EUPD/BPD aren\u2019t manipulative \u2013 but often those around us can be.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game.

The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network. It plans to grow its 7,000 agent network by three times a year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nScientists Created a Cyborg Fish Powered by Beating Human Heart Cells.

          "title": "Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game \u2014 Sarah Dusek",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

You have comported yourselves as Omoluabi in the true essence.\n\nWe have received and continue to receive the reports of the shenanigans of the officials who conducted the sham of an election.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s contribution to global trade could significantly increase if the new non-oil receipt programme of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is successfully implemented, according to FBNQuest.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, the CBN governor, announced the introduction of the RT200 Foreign Exchange (FX) programme, targeted at raising $200 billion from non-oil exports over the next three to five years.\n\nIf the programme, which one of its anchors has similarity with the Naira4dollar scheme, is successful, it will also raise Africa\u2019s largest economy\u2019s average income and its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a measurement of the monetary value of final goods and services of a country.\n\nThe \u201cRT200 FX Programme\u201d stands for \u201cRace to $200 billion in FX repatriation.\u201d With oil receipts \u2013 the major source of Nigeria\u2019s FX earnings under pressure due to evacuation challenges in Nigeria\u2019s oil sector, Emefiele sees the RT200 as a major route to raising non-oil FX earnings.\n\nThe African continent accounts for only 3 percent of global trade. With non-oil exports accounting for less than 15 percent of Nigeria\u2019s FX earnings, government-backed policies to raise the value of trade is a welcome development.\n\nSome of Nigeria\u2019s products with significant export earning potentials include Cotton ($2.6bn annually), Leather ($750m annually), Soya ($5bn), and Sugar ($2.5bn annually), among others.\n\nNigeria currently produces about 770,000 metric tons of Sesame, Cashew and Cocoa of which about 12,000 metric tons are consumed locally and 758,000 metric tons are exported, 16.8 percent of the 758,000 metric tons exported annually is processed.\n\nThe global chocolate industry is valued at about $130 billion, but Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria produce 72 percent of the global cocoa exports only earn 5 percent (CDI-$3.6bn; Ghana-$1.9bn and Nigeria-$804m).\n\nKen Ife, development consultant and lead consultant, Industry & Private Sector Development, ECOWAS Commission, noted this on Friday during a virtual Zoom conference on \u2018Nigeria Economic Recovery and CBN RT200 FX Programme: Role of Banks and Export Promotion Institutions\u2019, organised by Finance Correspondent Association of Nigeria (FICAN).\n\nThe RT200 programme has five key anchors, which include value-adding exports facility, non-oil commodities expansion facility, non-oil FX rebate scheme, dedicated non-oil export terminal and bi-annual non-oil export summit.\n\nMuda Yusuf, CEO, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), commended the new focus of the CBN on supply side strategy, saying supply-side policies were even more critical and impactful than demand management interventions in the foreign exchange market.\n\nOver the last couple of years, the CBN has been fixated on managing the demand side of the foreign exchange market and the outcomes have been suboptimal, he said.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the first anchor aims to provide concessionary and long-term funding for firms interested in expanding existing plants or building new ones to increase non-oil commodities value before they are exported. With the majority of current non-oil commodity exports being unprocessed, processing should increase Nigeria\u2019s FX earnings.\n\nThe second anchor, a non-oil commodities expansion facility, will provide financing to business projects that will significantly boost the local production of exportable commodities. This is to ensure there are raw commodities as feedstock to value-adding facilities i.e., the first anchor. This anchor will also ensure that local prices of commodities do not get inflated.\n\nRead also: Is inflation too big for the CBN to handle? (I)\n\nThe third anchor, the non-oil FX rebate scheme, aims to reward non-oil exporters that repatriate FX earnings back into the I&E window to boost liquidity in the market. It has similarities with the Naira4Dollar Scheme, which has increased remittances to $100m/week from only $6m, according to the CBN.\n\nThe fourth anchor, which will involve the building of dedicated non-oil export terminals, seeks to hasten the export process. To achieve its realisation, the CBN has called on state governments with existing ports to establish a dedicated export terminal and infrastructure network. States with current seaports in Nigeria include Lagos, Rivers, Cross River and Delta.\n\nThe final anchor is a biannual non-oil export summit with its inaugural event scheduled for the first week of April 22. The summit will aim to discuss the issues, challenges, and opportunities in the non-oil segment of the economy. Participants will include bankers, customs officials, the Nigerian Ports Authority, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council, clearing agents, cargo airlines, shipping lines, logistics companies, insurance practitioners, among others.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Chief Executive Officer, 9PSB, Branka Mracajac, has emphasized the need to pay close attention to content creation as an important factor in driving and accelerating financial inclusion in the country, stating that it is capable of enhancing the future of digital banking in the long-term.\n\nMracajac made this assertion, while presenting a keynote address, themed \u201cContent Creation and Financial Inclusion; The Future of Digital Banking\u201d at the Tech Summit Ogun 2022, which held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Abeokuta, Ogun State on Thursday February 17, 2022.\n\nAccording to her, while there are ongoing efforts to support the country\u2019s financial inclusion drive, a lot more rest on formulating tailored strategies that address specific needs. \u201cProviding access to the banking agents and touch points, across the country is happening as we speak; payment service banks,\n\nmicrofinance banks, and FinTech companies are all working on this. But will this be enough? Will the access to digital banks change the mindset of Nigerians in rural areas of the country and be enough to drive the transition from cash to cashless society?\u201d she questioned.\n\nProffering the way forward, Mracajac stressed the need to provide financial literacy through content that speaks to an average Nigerian in unserved rural areas of the country, stating that financial inclusion is a process, not just a point in time and space that we want to reach.\n\nShe added that, developing content that speaks only to the already banked and mirroring the digital financial habits of those who are fully included and heavily banked, will not help to keep the newly on-boarded in the system long-term.\n\nShe stated: \u201cWhile creating and delivering the content for financial inclusion, we need to have in mind the needs of its beneficiaries, the targeted end-users of the financial services who are currently underserved and the only sustainable way is that we join our forces and create the content \u2013 apps and services that will address the specific needs of a farmer in Benue, market women in Onitsha, trader in Kano, fisherman in Delta, and the woman selling ofada rice in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, she noted that, to drive the offline individuals and MSMEs from cash to cashless, from analog to digital and from informal to formal, content creators need to focus on two major goals; one, to deliver relevant and on-point digital financial literacy content, educating people about the principles, ways, modules, and benefits of banking. The second one, she stated, is needed for sustainable Financial inclusion: delivery of digital banking services that are a reflection of the lifestyle of the currently unbanked and underserved population.\n\nShe called on all stakeholders within the financial ecosystem, including content creators to work collectively to develop and implement a digital content strategy for the unbanked to move the financial inclusion needle and ultimately advance the economy, society and improve life of every Nigerian.\n\nIn his own keynote address, titled \u201cDisruptive Innovation: Production and Distribution of Creative Content, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), Dr. Abimbola Alale remarked that the quality of creatives and start-ups that Nigeria has produced is a testament to the potential of the ecosystem, and as such the ministry will continue to support the tech and creative entrepreneurs to play their part in developing Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\nThe Tech Summit Ogun is an annual convergence of Tech disruptors, innovators, startups, organizations and technology enthusiast in Ogun State, aimed at spurring technological innovation towards the digital transformation and technological advancement of Ogun State. This year, the summit attracted over 2000 participants, mainly the youths and start-ups.",

We have discovered too that our Northern brothers in Enugu are protected each time there were threats of breach of peace in the east,\u201d they said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe group also stressed that, \u201cWe will not forget how Governor Ugwuanyi immediately used his powers as the Chief Security Officer of the State to deploy security agencies to restore peace after a religious crisis broke out in Nssuka area last year.\n\n\u201cThough two mosques were destroyed following the protest , didn\u2019t waste to give order for immediate rebuilding of the two affected mosques ,which were handed over to the Nsukka Muslim community.\u201d\n\nWhile reiterating the call for Nigerians across other geo-political zones to join the cry for Igbo Presidency come 2023, the Muslim group added, \u201cPart of our reasons for rooting for Governor Ugwuanyi are his high level of compassion, tolerance, resilience, dedication, commitment, bridge-building spirit.\n\n\u201cWe also strongly believe that Governor Ifeanyi Ugwunayi if elected will replicate the steps taken in Enugu State to promoting peace, security, national unity and good governance.\u201d",

          "text": "It is sometimes the tiniest things that cause the countries to fight tooth and nail for. That is the case of Isla de Mba\u00f1e, a minuscule island in the waters of Gulf of Guinea. It has been a bone of contention for Gabon and Equatorial Guinea for decades.\n\nThe small island, only about 20ha, lies in a sea shelf potentially rich in oil and gas. Exploitation of oil and gas deposits, beginning in the 1990s, has driven economic growth in Equatorial Guinea, however the imperfect management and natural exhaustibility have led to the natural resources decrement, that if not addressed will result in a severe economic crisis in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nGabon as well heavily relies on the oil and gas income. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, it borders Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo. Gabon is the fifth largest oil producer in Africa: the oil sector has accounted for 80% of exports, 45% of GDP, and 60% of fiscal revenue on average. However, as the country is facing a decline in its oil reserves, which urges the Gabonese government to look for solutions.\n\nSeveral years ago, a critical decision has been made by both states to take up the issue with the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The arbitration process is incredibly slow and almost no progress has been made in years, however now the wheels start to move faster. On Tuesday, February 08, 2022, the President of Gabon Ali Bongo Ondimba received a delegation of the National Monitoring Commission of the Gabon-Equatorial Guinea Territorial Dispute led by its president Marie Madeleine Mborantsuo. Appointed last year, the agents authorized to bring the State before the International Court of Justice in the framework of the border dispute between the Gabonese Republic and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe situation looks less and less positive for Equatorial Guinea, as Gabon is backed a powerful global player, the former colonial power. Paris has interests in the region mostly because of the presence of the French business there. While the main partner of Equatorial Guinea in oil production is the USA, France tries to have a well-established presence in the region through hydrocarbon juggernaut Total, who is lobbying Gabon\u2019s interests in Mba\u00f1e dispute.\n\nThe lack of global back-up for Equatorial Guinea is quite vivid. The reputation of the Obiang regime is one of the reasons why Equatorial Guinea is internationally ostracized. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has been in power for almost half a century and is always portrayed in the Western media a classic case of an African dictator. His son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, is even more obnoxious: \u043freedy, power-thirsty and delusional. More than once the possible heir to the Equatoguinean throne has been found guilty of budget allocation and misappropriation of state funds.\n\nThe resource curse that affects both countries makes the small island of Mba\u00f1e a tasty morsel for Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. But Gabon seems to be very serious about taking the Mba\u00f1e area into its official borders. President Ali Bongo gave the exceptionally professional and ruthless team of lawyers all the directives necessary to be represented in the court of law. The case seems lost on the part of Equatorial Guinea and the loss of another oil-rich area will definitely hit hard on the undiversified economy of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nMasie is a political scientist specialising in West and Central Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "It is sometimes the tiniest things that cause the countries to fight tooth and nail for. That is the case of Isla de Mba\u00f1e, a minuscule island in the waters of Gulf of Guinea. It has been a bone of contention for Gabon and Equatorial Guinea for decades.\n\nThe small island, only about 20ha, lies in a sea shelf potentially rich in oil and gas. Exploitation of oil and gas deposits, beginning in the 1990s, has driven economic growth in Equatorial Guinea, however the imperfect management and natural exhaustibility have led to the natural resources decrement, that if not addressed will result in a severe economic crisis in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nGabon as well heavily relies on the oil and gas income. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, it borders Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo. Gabon is the fifth largest oil producer in Africa: the oil sector has accounted for 80% of exports, 45% of GDP, and 60% of fiscal revenue on average. However, as the country is facing a decline in its oil reserves, which urges the Gabonese government to look for solutions.\n\nSeveral years ago, a critical decision has been made by both states to take up the issue with the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The arbitration process is incredibly slow and almost no progress has been made in years, however now the wheels start to move faster. On Tuesday, February 08, 2022, the President of Gabon Ali Bongo Ondimba received a delegation of the National Monitoring Commission of the Gabon-Equatorial Guinea Territorial Dispute led by its president Marie Madeleine Mborantsuo. Appointed last year, the agents authorized to bring the State before the International Court of Justice in the framework of the border dispute between the Gabonese Republic and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe situation looks less and less positive for Equatorial Guinea, as Gabon is backed a powerful global player, the former colonial power. Paris has interests in the region mostly because of the presence of the French business there. While the main partner of Equatorial Guinea in oil production is the USA, France tries to have a well-established presence in the region through hydrocarbon juggernaut Total, who is lobbying Gabon\u2019s interests in Mba\u00f1e dispute.\n\nThe lack of global back-up for Equatorial Guinea is quite vivid. The reputation of the Obiang regime is one of the reasons why Equatorial Guinea is internationally ostracized. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has been in power for almost half a century and is always portrayed in the Western media a classic case of an African dictator. His son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, is even more obnoxious: \u043freedy, power-thirsty and delusional. More than once the possible heir to the Equatoguinean throne has been found guilty of budget allocation and misappropriation of state funds.\n\nThe resource curse that affects both countries makes the small island of Mba\u00f1e a tasty morsel for Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. But Gabon seems to be very serious about taking the Mba\u00f1e area into its official borders. President Ali Bongo gave the exceptionally professional and ruthless team of lawyers all the directives necessary to be represented in the court of law. The case seems lost on the part of Equatorial Guinea and the loss of another oil-rich area will definitely hit hard on the undiversified economy of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nMasie is a political scientist specialising in West and Central Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "Challenges affecting the administration of justice in Nigeria are being addressed with much hope for positive reform as more result-oriented work is in progress with expected changes, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said.\n\nHe said addressing delays in the administration of justice should involve imposing sanctions by a more intentional regime for the award of adverse and wasted costs.\n\nProf. Osinbajo spoke at the 20th memorial anniversary symposium in honour of a legal practitioner, Mr. Bankole Olumide Aluko, (SAN) themed, \u201cAdministration of Justice: the Ideal Standard, the Nigeria Reality and Our Potential\u201d on Friday.\n\nA statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, said the vice president who spoke on the issues of judicial appointments, delays in the dispensation of justice, democracy and digitisation in the judiciary among others, noted that the administration of justice system was the foundation of law and order, commerce and democracy.\n\n\u201cThe court is a taxpayer-funded public resource. The wasting or abuse of its finite time and resources without strict consequence will eventually discredit the system.\n\n\u201cAdverse costs are paid to the successful party in a civil case and wasted costs are directed against legal practitioners for poor professional standards in the conduct of a case.\n\n\u201cSevere costs should attend adjournments, there is no greater waste of taxpayer\u2019s funds than for a scheduled case to have to be adjourned. It is only heavy costs that will discourage this malfeasance.\u201d\n\nHe noted that certainty or predictability of judicial outcomes is one of the major strengths of the common law.\n\nRegarding the impact of the law on democracy, Osinbajo noted that the democratic rights of the people and their confidence in the notion of a government of the people, by the people, for the people, suffers when the system of electoral justice fails to see itself as a handmaid of the democratic process.\n\nCiting the decision of the Supreme Court in the 2019 elections in Zamfara State to buttress his point, he noted that to make sense, judicial decisions and reasoning must in most cases meet the common notions of fairness and justice.\n\n\u201cThe system of justice must recognise the larger principles that it serves. In judicial interpretation, the spirit is as important as the letter of the law. Otherwise, judicial decisions become technistic applications far removed from common sense.\n\n\u201cThe notions of justice that would meet public expectations of fairness and equity are those that promote substance over form. The observance of technicality over merit will always alienate the system of justice from the people it is meant to serve,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the expectations from judicial officers, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cwhile we ask for the best from our judicial officers, we must equally ensure that the conditions under which they operate are not only befitting but are good enough to attract the best of minds in our profession.\u201d",

Douye Diri, thanked Sasime for his kind welcome and reception.\n\nHe said that he was in the state to identify with developmental projects of the governor in collaboration with the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cAs you have heard, I am here at the invitation of my brother, the Governor of Bayelsa, to celebrate the second year anniversary of his government and also to look at some of the works that are going as well as perform the groundbreaking of a very important project.\n\n\u201cWe will be driving in a few minutes on the Yenagoa-Oporoma-Ukubie road; and thereafter, we will be performing the groundbreaking of the Angiama-Oporoma Bridge\u2013which are very crucial projects.\n\n\u201cI am sure you all know how important that road project is; and how several governments have worked on it including the immediate past governor of the state.\n\n\u201cThey have done their own bit up to a point and in the true tradition of continuum of the government, the current governor is set to complete the project and to ensure that he made available to the good people of Bayelsa, especially many of these communities that will benefit significantly from this.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to the vice president, the project is an evidence of the collaboration between the federal and state governments.\n\nHe said that President Muhammadu Buhari had shown by his openness, by his desire to ensure that despite political differences, every state in Nigeria benefits fairly and justly.\n\n\u201cBy making sure that as this road has been built, the Federal Government refunded the cost of the project so far and will continue to refund.\n\n\u201cSo, essentially, what we are seeing here is collaboration between the state and the Federal Governments for the benefit of the good people of Bayelsa.\n\n\u201cI think that this is the way it must be; at the end of the day, political differences do not matter to our people; what our people want is the same thing everywhere across the country.\n\n\u201cThey want good roads; they want good infrastructure; they want an enabling environment to be able to do their businesses; they want good health facilities; good social facilities; and that\u2019s what really the Federal Government is determined to do.\u2019\u2019\n\nOsinbajo said he was happy that the Federal Government had a partner in the government of Bayelsa, led by Diri.\n\nHe said sure desires could only be achieved if everyone works together, the federal, state, local governments working together.\n\n\u201cThe politicians and technocrats are working together to ensure that we achieve the same objective.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the governor for the warm welcome and for the nice Ijaw outfit that he (Osinbajo) wore.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at this outfit, you would imagine that this is what I wear everyday; it is well made but it is courtesy of my dear brother, Diri.\n\n\u201cHe is the one that made sure that I am appropriately attired.\n\n\u201cAll, I can say to him is that he has to make me a few more because after people have seen this, they expect me to show up more often in this outfit.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to thank you very much your Royal Majesties and thank the good people of Bayelsa for the warm welcome,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOsinbajo was earlier presented with a traditional gift \u2014 a walking stick \u2014 to match the Ijaw traditional attire he adorned.

We are duty-bound to ensure that the party avoids, by all means, necessary actions that would reduce its chances of electoral success in the forthcoming general elections.\n\nIn case you might not be aware, a lot would be at stake should the party go ahead with the planned national convention. The issues you have strived to resolve are still looking at us in the face, and it is common knowledge that all is not entirely well in the party.\n\nWe know that issues such as this are commonplace. However, it is our opinion that it would spell doom for the party should the party go ahead with the national convention now. We are concerned about the party\u2019s future, and it would be detrimental if we do not bring to your notice the dangers of going ahead with the national convention.\n\nIn case you might be aware, the Abdullahi Adamu led Reconciliatory Committee did not help matters in the task assigned to it. Instead, it further complicated the issues at stake by refusing to look at issues holistically but instead relied on rumours and hearsays in coming to a conclusion in its report.\n\nThe implication of the above statement is that those that were meant to be reconciled ended up infuriated by the actions of the reconciliatory committee. The signs in this regard are evident for every well-meaning member of the APC to see. But they have elected in their wisdom to downplay these contentious issues in the report submitted.\n\nThis, in our opinion, is a great disservice to your efforts at positioning the APC for electoral success. As you may be aware, the public space has been flooded with narratives that paint the APC as a party of strange bedfellows whose interests are propelled primarily for self-aggrandizement.\n\nMr Chairman may wish to critically examine the various agitations in the different states in the country. The feelers are not pleasant, and with the benefit of hindsight, it would indeed spell doom if the party goes ahead with the national convention under such circumstances.\n\nAs a party, we must be mindful of the burden of expectation placed on our shoulders in providing credible leadership to the country. Suppose we can\u2019t put our house in order. In that case, we do not have any moral justification for promising the country credible leadership because charity must begin from home.\n\nWe must also be mindful of the embarrassing litigations that have bedevilled the party at the state and federal levels. As embarrassing it is already, we would be doing ourselves a great disservice if the party leadership under your watch goes ahead with the planned convention.\n\nIt is common sense that the party is not in the proper position to hold a national convention any time soon. The security reports within our disposal confirm this worrisome circumstance that would make discerning minds circumspect.\n\nMr Chairman, you must be conscious that a lot is at stake in the party on the heels that party leaders from the North East and the North Central have rejected the chairmanship position of the party. This is indeed a red flag that the party must take seriously at the risk of making a charade of the national convention and its unpleasant consequences on the party\u2019s electoral chances in the 2023 general elections.\n\nWe are of the firm opinion that as a party, our emphasis should be on the stability of the party before the elections and not the interest of a select few who are blinded by their selfish ambitions without recourse to the sensibilities of the party members that have sacrificed greatly for the growth of the party over the years.\n\nIt would be unfair if the expectations of loyal party members were not met. The implication of this is that it would rattle the foundation of the party and, if care is not taken, might see to the final disintegration of the party to the advantage of the opposition party that has been strategizing to capitalize on our shortcomings to attain electoral success.\n\nMr Chairman, this advisory is in the party\u2019s best interest as we cannot afford to entertain any form of rancour in this critical point of our drive towards positioning the party for electoral success in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe truth remains that the February 26 date for the party\u2019s national convention is not realistic. Mr Chairman may wish to be reminded that should the party disintegrate, all fingers would point in his direction. The tendency for unsavoury remarks on his personality would not be in shortfall.\n\nMr Chairman, we are buoyed by the fact that your antecedent speaks volumes about the penchant for carrying all along in decision-making processes. And the issue of the national convention of the party should not be an exception.\n\nThe rational thing to do with the issues on the ground is to call off the planned national convention of the party, for now, to allow for complete healing to take place to put the party in a prime position to attain electoral success in the 2023 general elections.\n\nWe wish to inform you for free that should the party go ahead with the planned national convention, we should be prepared for an onslaught of unimaginable proportion that would rattle the very foundation of the party.\n\nWe strongly advise Mr Chairman to, without further delay, stop all preparations toward the national convention slated for 26th February 2022. We must first resolve the issues at hand as a matter of urgency. The urgency of now is staring at us in the face.\n\nWhile we anticipate a favourable response, please accept the assurances of our highest regard.\n\nSigned:\n\nHon. Maxwell Yakubu Gowon\n\nAspirant for National Youth Leader\n\nChairman, All Aspirants Forum.\n\nHon. Mohammed Bala Mohammed\n\nAspirant for National Secretary\n\nSecretary All Aspirants Forum\u201d.",

Verified information from the agents of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, has it that there are no record and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.\u201d\n\nThe APC conducted the primary election across the 332 wards in the state using the direct mode which allows party members to choose the candidate of their choice.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, who is seeking re-election for a second term, fell out recently with his predecessor and Minister of Interior, Aregbesola who now supports a former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Moshood Adeoti.\n\nA former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yussuff, is also a contender in Saturday\u2019s exercise.\n\nRigging Plan?\n\nAccording to the Aregbesola faction, there was no proper accreditation in a majority of the ward collation centres where voting took place and the accreditation done in some places were skewed in favour of Governor Oyetola as his supporters were allowed to pass through the process without much ado.\n\nIt claimed that the names of many members of the APC who wanted to vote for Adeoti were missing in the register of the party, adding that they had envisaged such by calling for the display of the party register before the conduct of the primary.\n\nThe faction also alleged that appointees of the governor were used as collation officers, which made the purported rigging plan of Oyetola an easy task.\n\n\u201cLoyalists and supporters of Adeoti are being chased and some were brutally attacked in wards where they have a strong presence,\u201d it said. \u201cOriade, Olorunda, Osogbo, Odo-Otin, Boripe, and Ile-Ife are the worst of this act of intimidation and disenfranchisement.\n\n\u201cWhere results of the election were announced (not recorded), the figure declared for Oyetola was highly inflated in the affected wards. INEC officials were noticeably absent in most of the wards to monitor the election.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable. It is a shame that a sitting governor could resort to malpractices in his desperate bid to secure a second term ticket.\u201d",

We need to keep calm and be adults,\u201d he said.\n\nNATO Jens Stoltenberg, speaking to German broadcaster ARD, stuck more closely to the US line when he described the risk of an attack as \u201cvery high\u201d.\n\n\u201cEvery indication indicates that Russia is planning a full-fledged attack against Ukraine,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\n\nNord Stream 2 spat\n\nBaerbock reiterated in Munich that Russia would face \u201cunprecedented\u201d sanctions should it invade Ukraine, some of which would bring economic pain to the countries imposing them.\n\nThat includes potentially halting the not-yet-certified Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany, she said, an issue that had previously driven a wedge in transatlantic relations.\n\nThe project, backed by Germany\u2019s previous chancellor Angela Merkel, has long irked the US and Germany\u2019s European partners, who believe it will be used as a geopolitical weapon by Putin.\n\nGermany\u2019s early reluctance to explicitly put Nord Stream 2 on the list of possible sanctions exasperated allies, particularly Washington, and raised doubts about Berlin\u2019s resolve in the Ukraine crisis.\n\nNew Chancellor Olaf Scholz travelled to Washington earlier this month to reassure President Biden that Germany could be counted on, and made clear that the pipeline would be stopped in case of a Russian attack.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Biden Now \u2018Convinced\u2019 Russia Will Launch Invasion of Ukraine",
          "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden says he is now \u201cconvinced\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital, an ominous assessment that emerged as the country\u2019s war-torn east saw more attacks that the West said could be designed to establish a pretext for an attack.\n\nAfter weeks of saying the U.S. was not sure if Putin had made the final decision, Biden said Friday that his judgment had changed, citing American intelligence.\n\n\u201cAs of this moment, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s made the decision,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have reason to believe that.\u201d He reiterated that the assault could occur in the \u201ccoming days.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments at the White House followed a day of rising violence that included a humanitarian convoy hit by shelling and a car bombing in the eastern city of Donetsk. Pro-Russian rebels began evacuating civilians from the conflict zone with an announcement that appeared to be part of Moscow\u2019s efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor instead.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin announced massive nuclear drills to flex its military muscle, and Putin pledged to protect Russia\u2019s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats.\n\nBiden reiterated his threat of crushing economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia if it does invade, and pressed Putin to reconsider. He said the U.S. and its Western allies were more united than ever to ensure Russia pays a steep price for any invasion.\n\nAs further indication that the Russians are preparing for a major military push, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border. That shift has been under way for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.\n\nThe official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.\n\nLines of communication remain open: The U.S. and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.\n\nImmediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops now posted around Ukraine\u2019s borders, the long-simmering separatist conflict could provide the spark for a broader attack.\n\nFears of such escalation intensified amid Friday\u2019s violence. A bombing struck a car outside the main government building in the rebel-held city of Donetsk, according to an Associated Press journalist there. The head of the separatist forces, Denis Sinenkov, said the car was his, the Interfax news agency reported.\n\nThere were no reports of casualties and no independent confirmation of the circumstances of the blast. Shelling and shooting are common along the line that separates Ukrainian forces and the rebels, but targeted violence is unusual in rebel-held cities.\n\nAdding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. The Luhansk Information Center said one of the blasts was in a natural gas main and cited witnesses as saying the other was at a vehicle service station. There was no immediate word on injuries or a cause. Luhansk officials blamed a gas main explosion earlier in the week on sabotage.\n\nOverall, monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported more than 600 explosions in the war-torn east of Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSeparatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that form Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland known as the Donbas announced they were evacuating civilians to Russia.\n\nDenis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk rebel government, said women, children and the elderly would go first, and that Russia has prepared facilities for them. Pushilin alleged in a video statement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.\n\nMetadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, The Associated Press confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin\u2019s disinformation campaign could include staged, prerecorded videos.\n\nAuthorities began moving children from an orphanage in Donetsk, and other residents boarded buses for Russia. Long lines formed at gas stations as more people prepared to leave on their own.\n\nPutin ordered the government to offer a payment of 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in the war-ravaged Donbas region.\n\nBy early Saturday, more than 1,100 residents of the rebel-controlled areas arrived in the neighboring Russian region of Rostov, according to the region\u2019s authorities, and thousands more were expected. Separatist officials have said they plan to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe explosions and the announced evacuations were in line with U.S. warnings of so-called false-flag attacks that Russia could use to justify an invasion.\n\nAround the volatile line of contact, a United Nations humanitarian convoy came under rebel shelling in the Luhansk region, Ukraine\u2019s military chief said. No casualties were reported. Rebels denied involvement and accused Ukraine of staging a provocation.\n\nUkraine denied planning any offensive.\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to diplomatic conflict resolution only,\u201d Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the threat to global security is \u201cmore complex and probably higher\u201d than during the Cold War. He told a security conference in Munich that a small mistake or miscommunication between major powers could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nRussia announced this week that it was pulling back forces from vast military exercises, but U.S. officials said they saw no sign of a pullback and instead observed more troops moving toward the border with Ukraine.\n\nIn other developments, the White House and the U.K. formally blamed Russia for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry and major banks. The announcement was the most pointed attribution of responsibility for the intrusions, which barraged websites with junk data to make them unreachable.\n\nThe Kremlin sent a reminder to the world of its nuclear might, announcing drills of its nuclear forces for the weekend. Putin will monitor the exercise Saturday that will involve multiple practice missile launches.\n\nAsked about Western warnings of a possible Russian invasion on Wednesday that did not materialize, Putin said: \u201cThere are so many false claims, and constantly reacting to them is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are doing what we consider necessary and will keep doing so,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have clear and precise goals conforming to national interests.\u201d\n\n___",

          "title": "Canada: Police Arrest 100 in Ottawa after 3-week Protest",
          "text": "Police arrested scores of demonstrators and towed away vehicles Friday in Canada\u2019s besieged capital, and a stream of trucks started leaving under the pressure, raising authorities\u2019 hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nBy evening, at least 100 people had been arrested, mostly on mischief charges, and nearly two dozen vehicles had been towed, including all of those blocking one of the city\u2019s major streets, authorities said. One officer had a minor injury, but no protesters were hurt, interim Ottawa Police Chief Steve Bell said.\n\nPolice \u201ccontinue to push forward to take control of our streets,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will work day and night until this is completed.\u201d\n\nThose arrested included four protest leaders. One received bail while the others remained jailed.\n\nThe crackdown on the self-styled Freedom Convoy began in the morning, when hundreds of police, some in riot gear and some carrying automatic weapons, descended into the protest zone and began leading demonstrators away in handcuffs through the snowy streets as holdout truckers blared their horns.\n\nTow truck operators \u2014 wearing neon-green ski masks, with their companies\u2019 decals taped over on their trucks to conceal their identities \u2014 arrived under police escort and started removing the hundreds of big rigs, campers and other vehicles parked shoulder-to-shoulder near Parliament. Police smashed through the door of at least one RV camper before hauling it away.\n\nScuffles broke out in places, and police repeatedly went nose-to-nose with the protesters and pushed the crowd back amid cries of \u201cFreedom!\u201d and the singing of the national anthem, \u201cO Canada.\u201d Later police on horses were used to push back the crowd for a time.\n\nPolice said late in the afternoon that protesters had assaulted officers and tried to take their weapons. Some began dismantling equipment at a stage where they had played music for weeks, saying they didn\u2019t want it to get destroyed.\n\nMany protesters stood their ground in the face of one of the biggest police enforcement actions in Canada\u2019s history, with officers drawn from around the country.\n\n\u201cFreedom was never free,\u201d said trucker Kevin Homaund, of Montreal. \u201cSo what if they put the handcuffs on us and they put us in jail?\u201d\n\nBut a steady procession of trucks began leaving Parliament Hill in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cThere are indications we are now starting to see progress,\u201d Ontario Premier Doug Ford said.\n\nPolice would not disclose how many protesters or vehicles remained downtown. All indications were that police would be working into the weekend to clear the area.\n\nThe capital and its paralyzed streets represented the movement\u2019s last stronghold after weeks of demonstrations and blockades that shut down border crossings into the U.S. and created one of the most serious tests yet for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They also shook Canada\u2019s reputation for civility, with some blaming America\u2019s influence.\n\nAuthorities had hesitated to move against the protests, in part because of fears of violence. The demonstrations have drawn right-wing extremists and veterans, some of them armed.\n\nWith police and the government facing accusations that they let the protests get out of hand, Trudeau on Monday invoked Canada\u2019s Emergencies Act. That gave law enforcement extraordinary authority to declare the blockades illegal, tow away trucks, arrest the drivers, suspend their licenses and freeze their bank accounts.\n\nOttawa police made their first move to end the occupation late Thursday with the arrest of two key protest leaders. They also sealed off much of the downtown area to outsiders to prevent them from coming to the aid of the protesters.\n\nThe emergency act enabled law enforcement authorities to compel tow truck companies to assist. Ottawa police said earlier that they couldn\u2019t find tow truck drivers willing to help because they either sympathized with the movement or feared retaliation.\n\nAs police worked to dismantle the siege, Pat King, one of the protest leaders, told truckers, \u201cPlease stay peaceful,\u201d while also threatening the livelihoods of the tow truck operators.\n\n\u201cYou are committing career suicide,\u201d King warned on Facebook. \u201cWe know where the trucks came from.\u201d\n\nKing himself was later arrested by officers who surrounded him in his car.\n\nOttawa police had made it clear for days that they were preparing to retake the streets. On Friday, even as the operation was underway, police issued another round of warnings via social media and loudspeaker, offering protesters one more chance to leave and avoid arrest.\n\nSome locked arms instead as officers formed a line to push them back.\n\nDan Holland, a protester from London Ontario, packed up his car as police closed in. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get beat up by this police,\u201d he said.\n\nChildren bundled up in coats and hats stood amid the crowd. Police said the protesters had put the youngsters in the middle in the confrontation.\n\nThe Freedom Convoy demonstrations initially focused on Canada\u2019s vaccine requirement for truckers entering the country but soon morphed into a broad attack on COVID-19 precautions and Trudeau\u2019s government.\n\nOttawa residents complained of being harassed and intimidated by the truckers and obtained a court injunction to stop their incessant honking.\n\nTrudeau portrayed the protesters as members of a \u201cfringe\u201d element. Canadians have largely embraced the country\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions, with the vast majority vaccinated, including an estimated 90% of the nation\u2019s truckers. Some of the vaccine and mask mandates imposed by the provinces are already falling away rapidly.\n\nThe biggest border blockade, at the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, disrupted the flow of auto parts between the two countries and forced the industry to curtail production. Authorities lifted the siege last weekend after arresting dozens of protesters.\n\nThe final border blockade, in Manitoba, across from North Dakota, ended peacefully on Wednesday.\n\nThe protests have been cheered on and received donations from conservatives in the U.S",
