          "title": "Kidnapped military officer remains in bandits\u2019 den one week after NDA attack",
          "text": "\u2026Search and rescue operations ongoing, says DHQ\n\nMajor Christopher Datong, who was kidnapped by daring bandits around 1 am on July 24 has spent one full week in his captors\u2019 den, raising concerns about the safety of ordinary, vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nDatong was kidnapped when the marauders, last Tuesday, invaded the country\u2019s foremost military institution, the Nigerian Defence Academy, Afaka, Kaduna, killing two officers \u2013 identified as Lieutenant Wulah and Flight Lieutenant Okoronkwo.\n\nThe nation was shocked to wake up to a new level of effrontery by gunmen, who wore army uniforms and attacked the NDA campus in the Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nThe bandits, who broke the fence of the institution, had headed in different parts of the premises and caught the officers on duty off guard.\n\nTwo officers lost their lives in the attack while the fate of the kidnapped officer delicately hangs in the balance.\n\nOnline reports have it that the bandits have contacted the family of Datong and have demanded some millions of naira as ransom but The PUNCH could not confirm the development as of the time of filing this report.\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH on Tuesday, Director, Defence Information, Major General Benjamin Sawyerr, said search and rescue operations are being conducted to rescue the kidnapped officer.\n\n\u201cOperations are being conducted to search and rescue him. The operation is still ongoing. Search and rescue operations does not have a timeline and there is no point discussing how far the operations have gone because it will jeopardise secrecy and the efforts of those conducting the operations,\u201d Sawyerr told our correspondent.\n\nAlso, a retired Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Austin Iwar, told The PUNCH that he believed the military would rescue the kidnapped officer.\n\nHe, however, said the NDA invasion showed that the whole country is exposed.\n\n\u201cIt reveals the level of vulnerability that the entire country is exposed to, not only barracks or security formations but including our private homes and residential areas that the bandits have decided to attack because nobody in his wildest imagination will ever expect that bandits will have the temerity to attack military formations.\n\n\u201cThe bandits have seen that there are soft spots that could exploit in NDA. And anybody that stood on the way was shot. It is very unfortunate that we are losing officers. But I believe that the military is up to the task, they have proved several times they can handle it even though sometimes it looks overwhelming but I believe they will rescue the kidnapped military officer.\n\n\u201cOne of the lessons here is that we should not assume that because we are military personnel, we should not assume that we are not vulnerable. A criminal always exploits opportunities,\u201d Iwar told our correspondent.\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s attack, many Nigerians had taken to social media to expressed deep anger at the affront by bandits, who have become emboldened in their attacks against the military after shooting down a Nigerian Air Force jet earlier in July.\n\nThe military authorities had started compiling the names of errant personnel to be court-martialed and had constituted a board of enquiry on the embarrassing incident.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor had also visited the NDA last Wednesday, saying \u201cthis madness must stop\u201d.\n\nThe military has a heavy presence in Kaduna with no fewer than six military formations in the city. The military formations include Jaji Military Cantonment; 1 Mech. Division Headquarters, Nigerian Army, Kaduna; New Barracks, otherwise known as \u2018Kotoko\u2019 Barracks; Old Site of the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna; Kalanpazi Barracks (Artillery Regiment) and the Nigerian Air Force Base.\n\nWith all military formations and institutions present in the state, Kaduna has perhaps been the worst hit by the nefarious activities of bandits and kidnappers in recent times.\n\nAccording to the official statistics by Governor Nasir El-Rufai administration, the vicious marauders killed at least 525 innocent lives, kidnapped 1,723 between January and June 2021.\n\nThe NDA campus is opposite the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka where bandits abducted 39 students on March 11, 2021. The bandits had demanded N500m to free the captives.\n\nOn April 20, 2021, bandits had also kidnapped at least 23 students of Greenfield University and a member of staff.\n\nOn July 5, 2021, around 2am, bandits stormed Bethel Baptist School, Damishi, Kaduna, and abducted 121 pupils, according to the Proprietor of the school, Rev. Ishaya Jangado.\n\nIn some cases, bandits released some of the students after their parents parted with millions of naira as ransom but a few students haven\u2019t been lucky to make it out alive.\n\nBeyond Kaduna, kidnapping has become a sordid menace and a lucrative \u2018enterprise\u2019 in Nigeria as the West African nation\u2019s security situation worsens.\n\nMany Nigerians are disappointed in the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who rode to power on the heels of combating the security challenges plaguing the country in 2015 but the situation seems to have been aggravated in the last six years.\n\nAside from the kidnapping of students from schools, hundreds of Nigerians have also fallen victims to kidnappers in recent times. Their families have had to part with millions of naira to secure their release after days or even weeks of excruciating pains and agony. However, some families have not been so lucky as the daredevil kidnappers rape and kill their victims even after receiving millions of naira as ransom.\n\nThe Senate had proposed a bill seeking to prohibit the payment and receipt of ransom for the release of any person kidnapped, imprisoned or wrongfully confined.\n\nAccording to the bill, Nigerians who pay ransom to kidnappers and kidnappers who receive ransom risk 15 years imprisonment.\n\nBut many Nigerians had flayed the upper chamber and described the bill as stupid. They noted that the National Assembly should instead focus on ensuring they make laws that guarantee adequate security for every Nigerian.",

          "title": "EFCC\u2019s \u201cEagle Eye\u2019\u2019 app as instrument for anti-graft war",
          "text": "Eagle Eye\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recently inaugurated a data-collection mobile application (app) to enhance its intelligence gathering efforts at fighting corruption.\n\nThe technology, codenamed \u201cEagle Eye\u2019\u2019, seeks to boost public participation in the fight against corruption by easing the process of reporting economic and financial crimes to the commission.\n\nA major complaint by anti-graft agencies in the country has been that Nigerians are generally reluctant when it comes to assisting with vital information on criminals and their activities.\n\nSecurity experts have long identified this as a major setback in the federal government\u2019s fight against corruption in the land.\n\nThey blame the public apathy on certain realities, including lack of confidence in security agents based on experiences, and bottlenecks in the conventional financial crime reporting process, which is based on submission of written petitions by informants.\n\nAccording to the EFCC, \u201cEagle Eye\u2019\u2019 is designed to address these and several other shortcomings that have long alienated the public in the government\u2019s anti-corruption crusade.\n\n\u201cEagle Eye does not replace the conventional way of submitting petitions. It is, however, a means of reporting financial crimes as they happen\u2019\u2019 is a message on the app.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration in Abuja, the Chairman of EFCC, Mr Abdulrasheed Bawa, shed light on two key features of the app and how it would make a difference in the financial crime reporting process.\n\nBawa explained that the technology was designed to guarantee the anonymity or security of anyone reporting cases of corruption to the EFCC.\n\nHe said a unique advantage of the application was the elimination of a direct person-to-person interface in the reporting process, thereby guaranteeing confidentiality and \u201can added incentive for effective whistleblowing\u2019\u2019.\n\nAccording to him, it is a significant departure from the conventional reporting channel that requires disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity to the commission.\n\nHe said that whistleblowers would no longer have to worry about being sold out by corrupt agents to affected criminals.\n\nThe app, which is available on Apple or Google Playstore, does not require registration by a user.\n\nUsers have an option to reveal their identities by providing personal information such as name, phone number, e-mail address and contact address.\n\n\u201cWith the app, those who hitherto were afraid of report corruption cases to the commission either for fear of being identified by the culprits or having their identities revealed, can now do so with the assurance of full anonymity,\u2019\u2019 Bawa said.\n\nHe also explained that the \u201cEagle Eye\u2019\u2019 app does not only make it easy for the public to share information with the EFCC, it also brings the commission closer to the people, especially those at the grassroots.\n\nIt eliminates the burden of paperwork, long-distant travel to an EFCC\u2019s office to submit a petition, and the cost and delays associated with mailing of documents to the commission. The technology also came with a photo upload link.\n\nThe EFCC boss said: \u201cEagle Eye represents a new experience in information sharing and crime reporting between the public and the EFCC.\n\n\u201cWith this app, Nigerians and non-Nigerians can easily take a picture of a property suspected to have been fraudulently or corruptly acquired and send to us seamlessly\u2019\u2019.\n\nHowever, Bawa explained that the app was not a replacement of the traditional way of lodging complaints through lawyers or in-person, adding that the commission would continue to receive information or petitions from individuals the old way.\n\n\u201cWe are not going digital completely\u2019\u2019, Bawa said.\n\nAnthony Uzor (not real name), who works in the Federal Ministry of Finance, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that he had always wanted to submit petitions to the EFCC but did not know how to go about it.\n\nBesides, Uzor said the fear of his identity being revealed to those exposed had also been a major drawback for him.\n\n\u201cIf this app is what they say it is, then the two major obstacles holding me back from reaching out to the EFCC have been removed; I think it will also encourage many other Nigerians in my shoe,\u2019\u2019 Uzor said.\n\nAccording to the EFCC chairman, the initiative is a clear demonstration of his pledge, on assumption of office, to run a technology-driven agency.\n\n\u201cThe Eagle Eye will go a long way in aiding the reportage of fraudulent activities of individuals, especially cases of money laundering through the real estate sector,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe information sharing links on the app are divided into four sections \u2014 A to D.\n\nSection A, which is labelled \u201cSelect pictures/camera\u2019\u2019, instructs users to \u201ccapture or select from your gallery picture(s) of suspect/assert/property you wish to report\u2019\u2019.\n\nSection B states location details, that is, the location of suspects or assets or property that users wish to report.\n\nSection C, labeled \u201cReport description\u2019\u2019, asks users to provide detailed description of pictures attached.\n\nUnder Section D, labelled \u201cInformant details (optional\u2019\u2019), informants who wish to reveal their identities can do so by providing their full names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and residential addresses.\n\nBawa, therefore, appealed to the public to take advantage of the app in bringing cases of corruption and economic crimes to the knowledge of the EFCC.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nMr Kehinde Ibiteye, said he risked his life to deliver N2.5 million ransom to kidnappers of his brother-in-law, Mr Kayode Ajayi, and his son, Olawale, in a forest in Bwari area of the FCT.\n\nIbiteye made this known while giving a special thanksgiving to God for his safe return, on Sunday during a service at the Word of Life Area of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in Kubwa, Abuja.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), however, scheduled an interview session with him after the service.\n\nThe RCCG member, while narrating his experience, said his aunt\u2019s husband, together with his son, were kidnapped at Ungwan-Fulani, a suburb in Bwari where they live at the wee hour of Aug. 23.\n\n\u201cI got a phone call from a member of my family that my aunt\u2019s husband and his 19-year-old son have been kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThey were kidnapped, not on the road, but right in their house. The gunmen, numbering about 25, broke into the house and took them away.\n\n\u201cThey first broke into a neighbour\u2019s residence but nobody was seen in the house.\n\n\u201cWhen they couldn\u2019t find anyone, they went to my aunt\u2019s house, forcefully made their way into the house, collected monies to the tune of N20,000, two android phones, took along with them food items and abducted the father and son.\n\n\u201cI immediately called his wife who cried as she confirmed the ugly experience.\n\n\u201cThey were kidnapped last week Monday between the hours of 12am and 1am,\u201d he narrated.\n\nIbiteye said her aunt informed that the police in the area came few minutes after the abduction but to no avail.\n\n\u201cAnd since I speak Hausa fluently and no other person could communicate in the language, I engaged their abductors in telephone conversations through my aunt\u2019s mobile phone which they called with.\n\n\u201cAt first, they placed N15 million bounty on their heads if we want them released,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said after he negotiated further, they lowered the ransom to N2.5 million.\n\nAccording to him, the police did little or nothing to get the victims rescued.\n\n\u201cThe police only called to warn that we shouldn\u2019t take money to the terrorists; we shouldn\u2019t be the one to be in charge.\n\n\u201cGenerally, they have lackadaisical approach to the whole thing; they weren\u2019t forthcoming. I didn\u2019t even take them seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said after the money was raised, their abductors instructed that the money should be taken to a hilly forest after a village called Kuchikwo in Bwari.\n\nIbiteye lamented that the biggest challenge for the family was, however, who to take the money to the kidnappers\n\n\u201cI finally resolved to take the N2.5 million to them in the forest. I took a risk giving that my blood relatives were involved.\n\n\u201cI decided not to inform my wife and children about my resolution.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I did was to pray to God. I told God to protect me, guide me and see me through the adventure.\n\n\u201cI also told God that as I go to the forest, I would come back with my aunt\u2019s husband and his son unhurt.\n\n\u201cI developed a strong faith, believing that God would not disappoint me\n\n\u201cAnd when I was conversing with the abductors, I tried to build their confidence on the fact that the money we agreed on finally would definitely get to them so long they could guarantee the safety of the captives,.\n\n\u201cAt times if I talked with them, I would be hearing how my in-law and his son were being tortured.\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the kidnappers warned us against inviting the police.\n\n\u201cThey warned that if we informed the police, they would know and we would pay dearly for it,\u201d Ibiteye said.\n\nHe said the captors gave him instructions at intervals.\n\n\u201cI was told to get an Okada rider (a commercial motorcyclist) who is well familiar with the environment to convey me to their enclave.\n\n\u201cI picked an okada randomly at about 3p.m. on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAlthough he initially declined to go on the journey, after so much pressure from people who know him, he agreed to convey me to the forest.\n\n\u201cHe said he would collect N10, 000 as transport fare.\n\n\u201cWhen I spoke with the captors, they ordered me to give the phone to the bike man and they directed us to leave for the forest around 5pm.\n\n\u201cWe travelled for about one and half hours before getting to a marketplace where we were directed to pull up.\n\n\u201cAt this time, it was getting dark and cloudy. They did this to allow the night fall before getting to their area.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, they directed us to continue the journey.\n\n\u201cAt about 8pm that day, we got to the hinterland of the forest, surrounded by hills and mountains.\n\n\u201cThe forest is two villages after Kuchikwo, and throughout our journey from there, it was raining heavily,\u201d he said.\n\nIbiteye said a man, hanging AK-47 on his shoulder, came out from their camp, flashed light at them and ordered him to place the money on the rocky ground.\n\n\u201cHe asked if the money was complete and I responded in affirmation.\n\n\u201cWe were then told to go back to the marketplace at the village where we had a stopover on our way going to the forest.\n\n\u201cThey said there, my in-law would reunite with us,\u201d he said.\n\nIbiteye, who said it was at the market area the abductees came out from a bush, said the four of them rode on the motorcycle back home.\n\n\u201cThough the market was not operating at the time, I became curious if anybody passes by, until I saw my in-law and his son coming out from a nearby bush,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said immediately they got to Bwari, his in-law and his son were taken to hospital because of the wounds sustained from the torture and various inhuman treatments subjected to while in captivity.\n\nIbiteye said based on the victims\u2019 account, the kidnappers had various sophisticated weapons in their camp.\n\n\u201cThey also observed that those guys (abductors) were working as syndicate because they conversed with some other people either within or outside Abuja on the phone.\n\n\u201cBesides, my in-law told me that when the police team came around the day they were kidnapped shooting sporadically in the air, all of them together with their captors were still within the surroundings.\n\n\u201cIt was after the police team left that they began to embark on the journey to the forest,\u201d he said.\n\nIbiteye described his experience as \u201chorrible and risky.\u201d\n\nThe RCCG member, who hinted that the incident was the third kidnap case in the area, called on the Federal Government to intervene.\n\n\u201cI believe the government is aware about the operations of these criminals and they should be sincere in fulfilling their mandate of ensuring safety of lives and property of citizenry,\u201d he urged.\n\nHowever, when NAN sought the confirmation of the incident in a phone call put across to the Police Public Relations Officer, FCT Command, Mariam Yusuf on Monday, she requested for a text message after listening to the subject matter.\n\nHowever, she neither responded to the text message sent to her phone nor answered subsequent calls put across to her as at the time of filing the report.(NAN)(",

          "text": "By Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South\n\nWARRI- DEPUTY Governor of Delta State, Deacon Kingsley Otuaro, has revealed that his \u201cinnate potential as problem solver\u201d was what catapulted him, once a jobless boy in the creeks of Niger-Delta, to his present status in life, charging youths to positively develop their inborn abilities.\n\n\u201cTo the glory of God, it was the problem -solving potential that gave me the opportunity to become the deputy governor of Delta state today. It also earned me opportunity from then Acting President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, to contribute towards resolving Niger Delta challenge\u201d, he said at an inspirational conference by Aspire Global Group, led by Mr. Wisdom Oghoghovia, at Warri, weekend.\n\n\u201cI just landed in London when I got an invitation from the Presidency then led by Prof. Yemi Osibanjo as Acting President. I called my principal, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa who asked me to rejig my schedule to attend to the call. I eventually flew in to Abuja and sat face to face with decision makers who said they had intelligence I could do something about resolving then raging oil crisis in the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency\u2019s subsequent backing did a lot to calm down the upheaval\u201d, he added.\n\nNarrating his role in the rescue of six abducted students of a Lagos High School during Governor Ambode\u2019s tenure, Otuaro urged youths to \u201cdiscover and give positive commercial value to your innate potentials\u201d, stressing that \u201cinnate potential was a key to entrepreneurial success\u201d.\n\nAdvising the youths to take advantage of the state government\u2019s programmes tagged YAGEP, STEP, RYSA, among others to express their potentials, he categorized earlier cases where problem- solving ability led him to his convinction that \u201cthe Lord respects your discovery and understanding of your potential and provides opportunities in your path\u201d.\n\n\u201cI grew up in the creeks of the Niger Delta, which we know to be challenging environment with poor infrastructure. Going from Secondary School to the University was a challenging experience. Let me inform that you are a product of a socialization process that involves all the people you meet, the books you read, the company \u2013 good, bad and ugly that you keep and who wrongly or nicely influence you. All of these cumulatively make you.\n\nALSO READ: NDDC: inaugurating board won\u2019t stop forensic audit \u2013 Otuaro\n\n\u201cEven before graduation from the Edo State (now Ambrose Alli) University, Ekpoma , where I studied Law, I discovered that I had an inborn potential as problem- solver, just as all of you have different potentials that need to be discovered\n\n\u201cDue to my problem-solving potential, I got the confidence of my community\u2019s Governing Council which invited me on several occasions, shortly before I left university, to their meetings while not being a member, to resolve problems. I was given easy ride to becoming subsequent Chairman of the community\u2019s Governing Council for six straight years\u201d, Otuaro narrated.\n\nHe informed that his search for job rather threw him up as an employer of labour due to his problem -solving potential.\n\n\u201cI preferred works not tied to timelines of 8.00 am to 4.00 pm or 5.00 pm, so I looked to solve a problem my people suffered in hands of Chevron Nigeria Limited , a multinational oil giant, whose deep sea wells and operations, we constructively insisted, destroyed our parents\u2019 capacity for fishing livelihood and means to properly train us, their children.\n\n\u201cWe demanded compensation through constructive agitations, approaching the National Assembly\u2019s Oil and Gas Committee then led by Senator David Briggidi. We succeeded with job slots and contract opportunities, which made us become employers of labour\u201d, Otuaro said amidst applause by the stimulated audience.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Insecurity: Do not be evil accessory in Benue \u2013 Southeast youth leaders blast Akume",
          "text": "A coalition of South-East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, the apex socio-political group in the South-East geo-political zone has advised the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume to reverse his stance on the security situation in Benue state.\n\nRecall that Akume, former governor of Benue State, alongside other members of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC had on Monday called for a state of emergency in Benue following Governor Samuel Ortom\u2019s consistent outcry of killings in the state.\n\nAlso, during the press conference in Abuja Senator Akume urged Governor Ortom to apologize to President Muhammadu Buhari for criticising him over his alleged inability to tackle the security crisis in Benue and other parts of the nation.\n\nReacting, COSEYL in a statement issued on Tuesday by its President General, Hon. Goodluck Egwu Ibem and the Secretary-General, Comrade Kanice Igwe said \u201cAkume is now living in an alternate universe\u201d, describing him as \u201can unfortunate spent man, a willing comprador in Benue politics\u201d.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cThe latest attention of Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, the apex socio-political group in the South-East geo-political zone has been drawn to a rather impolitic politics of Senator George Akume, former governor of Benue State, whose plan chiefly is to orchestrate and cause a political tsunami in Benue just to take over the instrumentality and reigns of power evidently through his latest call for emergency rule in the state.\n\n\u201cThe antics of politically run-down men like Akume is nothing new to the Nigerian space where \u201cstomach infrastructure\u201d, beyond a mere neologizing, is a survival quest for men like Akume. Having obtained, seen and studied a copy of the statement where Akume called for unreserved apology from His Excellency Governor Samuel Ortom to the president, one gets clearer the picture and message that when it comes to issue of Benue politics, Akume is now living in an alternate universe. He is an unfortunate spent man, a willing comprador in Benue politics. A willing tool for distablization in the state that gave him mandate to preside over her affairs. This call for emergency is Akume\u2019s thank-you message to Benue. Sad.\n\nEx-Benue Gov, Akume defending Fulani herdsmen to protect his job \u2013 Tiv youths\n\n\u201cThe realities of the day in Nigeria does not even require the best social or political commentator to tell away the fact that with the current APC-led federal government, unity is far yet from the goal of the Nigerian state. This, COSEYL says, is not about Ortom but about the current state of the nation and the reality of lack inclusiveness the Buhari administration has served Nigeria and Nigerians since 2015. Those records speak for themselves and so it makes no sense delving into them. But the question is, \u201cWhat does Akume have concerning what have been said by men like retired Commodore Kunle Alawunmi who alleged recently that Buhari\u2019s government knows the sponsors of Boko Haram? What does Akume have in defence of the federal government against the homily of Bishop Matthew Kukah and other voices of reason, including those outside political players? How does he see Gumi, and what has he done differently to show he knows the way he now points? Do lives of Benue people still matter for him?\n\n\u201cGeorge Akume, former two-term governor of Benue and now minister of special duties and inter-givernmental relations does not understand a thing about his position and designation. He, as a minister of inter-governmental relations, dived emtovely headlong into a matter he should have mediated constructively than resort to anarchy \u2013 call for emergency rule. With this, as a coalition, we are convinced that Akume has no scintilla of integrity left in him, in fact, the last few drops have been guzzled by brinkmanship and partisanship!\n\n\u201cFor the sake of truth, powers of emergency does not lie with the president alone as our constitution is both contemplative and express about the subject. Such powers must be derived through two-thirds majority vote of the National Assembly, then gazetted, before it becomes operational. Sadly, it was the Balewa-style of emergency (1962/3 in the Western region) sustained by Obasanjo (in Plateau state against Joshua Dariye), both which have no legal and constitutional basis that Akume proposed as a panacea to a problem the inactions of the federal government magnified and heightened. This anomaly \u2013 as with emergency rule in Nigeria \u2013 was corrected when President Goodluck Jonathan, acting in accordance with the National Assembly majority votes, declared an emergency in Borno, Yobe and Bauchi States. Sadly, Akume wants to see the termination and uproot of a democratically elected authority just like the one in which cabinet he serves. He, by this act, is trying to take the nation\u2019s little progress back to the stone age characterised by Hobbesian life!\n\n\u201cWhen he served as governor, Akume too had issues with the federal government led by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, why does he now think anarchy is the solution to herders killing and sacking of humans in Benue State?\n\n\u201cAs a Coalition of youth, we have followed for long now the events unfolding in the nation, especially those concerning her security matters. Such issues are not one to play politics with or to indulge in power tussle over than they require a pragmatic and national approach. This is what we are not seeing happen under the government of the day in which Akume serves!\n\n\u201cInter-governmental relations is not one new in Nigeria, and whether it has been healthy or sick is not new too. It bears repeating that throughout the 1960s such an unhealthy one played out between the federal government and regional governments of the West (1962/3) and later between the same (military) federal government and Eastern region (1967-70). We had such issues during the return to democracy shortly after 1999 between President Olusegun Obasanjo and Governor Bola Tinubu of Lagos State and between the same Obasanjo and virtually all the oil-producing states over resource control and offshore/onshore dichotomy. We saw Plateau state too. What matters is how such relations are managed, not necessarily aggravated by the ministry that ought to have controlled them. Akume does not deserve to occupy that position one minute longer than and from now.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that in defence of lies and pecuniary interest, many Nigerian supporters of the establishment and status quo would not only mortgage their right for a mess of porridge but will betray their own brothers and home state as the machinery of anarchy and blackmail. Akume falls within this class, he does not go beyond.\n\n\u201cWe wish to see peace in Benue and any other parts of the country, part of the peace we want is constitutional order, not any plot to unseat Ortom, the voice of the voiceless and the constant star in the Northern firmament. Ortom is the voice of reason, of hope and dignity, his statesmen know better and follow his lead. No wonder the master said, \u201cI know my sheep, my sheep know me\u201d, in any case, who knows Akume?\u201d\n\nBenue govt tasks EFCC to Probe Akume over alleged N2 billion misappropriation",

          "text": "Kaduna residents, on Tuesday, kicked against the ban of weekly markets in five local government areas of the State.\n\nThey described it as a death penalty imposed on them for voting the APC-led Governnent in the state\n\nRecall that the state government on Monday said it had banned the weekly markets in Birnin Gwari, Kajuru, Chikun, Igabi and Giwa local governments.\n\nThe Goverment said the decision was taken after it reviewed security situation in the state.\n\nBut many residents who spoke to DAILY POST in Kaduna on Tuesday kicked against the ban.\n\nSome said the Government banned the market in order to starve people to death since many relied on weekly markets to survive.\n\nOthers who were amazed over the ban said if bandits could move from house to house, room to rooms in the night, killing and kidnapping people, banning weekly markets would not stop security threat in the state.\n\nA resident of Birnin Gwari LGA, Alhaji Ibrahim Danladi, who was not comfortable with the decision, narrated how the weekly markets helped him to train his children and provided an opportunity for him to interact with numerous businessmen.\n\n\u201cBanning weekly markets will not stop kidnappers from attacking us.\n\n\u201cKidnappers move from one point to another, kill, kidnap and destroy houses unchallenged. What effect does banning weekly markets have on them? Nothing.\n\n\u201cI am a businessman, buying and selling all kind of foodstuffs. I move from one weekly market to another within the 23 LGA every week. I interact with different people, exchange business ideas.\n\n\u201cMost times, I made brisky profit. From what I earned as profit, I have trained my five children. Although they are yet to be employed, I still use the money I earn from the market business to feed them. I have built two bedrooms, bought car, and presently, I planned to carry out another building project before the ban,\u201d he said.\n\nA farmer who stays in Igabi Local Government area of the state, Murtala Dansokoto told DAILY POST that the ban had dealt a wicked blow on his family.\n\n\u201cI take my farm produce to sell in Kajuru market. From the sales, I buy food and ingridients for my family. I plant cassava, but, I cannot eat cassava alone,\u201d he lamented.\n\nIn Kajuru LGA, Mrs. Jummai Nasir said, \u201cas a widow who has no other means of livelihood, it\u2019s going to be tough for me. I feed my children through buying from one market, and I take it to another market following week, and sell. The profit I make is used to pay my children\u2019s school fees, cloth them, and buy text books. Now, it\u2019s going to be difficult\u201d\n\nMr. Usman Ademu who resides in Igabi said, \u201cIn Kaduna State, no factory is working.

          "title": "Digital Currency Gains Traction as CBN Appoints Technical Partner",
          "text": "\u2022IMF urges caution on adoption of cryptocurrency as national currency\n\nNdubuisi Francis and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday announced the formal engagement of global fintech company, Bitt Inc., as technical partner for its proposed digital currency, also known as e-Naira. CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, disclosed this in Abuja.\n\nBut the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cautioned that countries seeking to adopt the digital currency should be wary of its disadvantages.\n\nEmefiele said the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would bring about increased cross-border trade, accelerate financial inclusion, and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow. He said the digital money, also known as cryptocurrency, would lead to easier targeted social interventions, as well as improvement in monetary policy effectiveness, payment systems efficiency, and tax collection.\n\nCBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, explained, in a statement, that the e-Naira project had been a long and thorough process for the apex bank following its resolve in 2017 to digitise the local currency after extensive research and exploration.\n\nNwanisobi said CBN\u2019s decision was in line with an unmistakable global trend in which over 85 per cent of central banks were considering adopting digital currencies in their countries.\n\nThe CBN pointed out that the selection of Bitt Inc. from among highly competitive bidders was based on the company\u2019s technical competence, efficiency, platform security, interoperability, and implementation experience.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn choosing Bitt Inc. the CBN will rely on the company\u2019s tested and proven digital currency experience, which is already in circulation in several Eastern Caribbean countries.\n\n\u201cBitt Inc. was key to the development and successful launch of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) in April 2021.\u201d\n\nEmefiele had recently hinted that a national digital currency would be launched in October. The apex bank had also said the digital currency would be treated as a critical national infrastructure to protect it from operational and cyber-security risks.\n\nFurther clarifying the e-Naira project, the CBN governor had said, \u201cYou have some naira in your account and you chose to convert part of your naira into a digital wallet by way of a digital currency. We will support that.\n\n\u201cIf, for instance, you have N10 million in your account. Of course, when this starts, the CBN will move some of the balances of banks with CBN to those banks in digital currency.\n\n\u201cSo you go to your bank, you have N10 million and you want to move N2 million out of your N10 million into a digital currency.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll debit your account and move it to your wallet of N2 million digital currency, which you can spend across countries.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cSo we think that this is a noble idea and we are not the first\u2026many other central banks are at advanced stages of revealing their own digital currency.\n\n\u201cOur own digital currency, which is tagged e-Naira, will certainly come into operation, by the special grace of God, by October and we are working very hard for this.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cWe believe that transactions will be cheaper and more efficient, as there will be less to complete.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy, just like the rest of the world, is going digital and cash cannot play in that space. Therefore, e-Naira, which will represent the digital equivalent of cash, will be used as the fiat currency to effect transactions.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of financial inclusion, we believe that with over 30 per cent of bankable adults still outside the financial system, the ability to have offline payment through our e-Naira initiative will bring most of them into the formal financial sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to him,\u201d The use of cash is declining everywhere in the world, just as in Nigeria and with the advent of digital commerce, which is booming in the country, more and more people are adopting the use of electronic money to facilitate digital commerce.\n\n\u201cSo our e-Naira is a digital representation of cash, which means as a fiat currency, it is a fiat currency that will be just as acceptable as the physical or analogue naira.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the need for wide stakeholder engagement and education to be able to create awareness for the use of e-Naira as alternative to cash to further drive towards a cashless society.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, just like the CBN had warned previously, IMF sued for caution by countries seeking to use crypto-assets as their national currency. The multilateral institution reiterated that the demerits of adopting crypto-assets as national currency outweighed its merits.\n\nThe Washington-based institution gave the advice in a blog post, titled: \u201cCrypto-assets as National Currency? A Step Too Far.\u201d It acknowledged that the new digital forms of money had the potential to provide cheaper and faster payments, enhance financial inclusion, improve resilience and competition among payment providers, and facilitate cross-border transfers.\n\nHowever, IMF stated that the potential benefits were not a straightforward process, as it required significant investment as well as difficult policy choices, such as clarifying the role of the public and private sectors in providing and regulating digital forms of money.\n\nIt observed that some countries might be tempted by a shortcut -adopting crypto-assets as national currencies, adding, \u201cmany are indeed secure, easy to access, and cheap to transact.\u201d\n\nThe IMF stated, \u201cWe believe, however, that in most cases, risks and costs outweigh potential benefits. Crypto-assets are privately issued tokens based on cryptographic techniques and denominated in their own unit of account.\n\n\u201cTheir value can be extremely volatile. Bitcoin, for instance, reached a peak of $65,000 in April and crashed to less than half that value two months later.\n\n\u201cAnd yet, Bitcoin lives on.

          "text": "\u00aaSays NJC has always warned judicial officers to be circumspect in granting Exparte\n\n\u2022 NBA threatens to sanction erring senior members\n\n\u2022SANs welcome Muhammad\u2019s intervention\n\nTobi Soniyi and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nIn obvious reaction to THISDAY lead report yesterday, the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Justice Tanko Ibrahim Muhammad immediately swung into action by summoning six Chief Judges of State High Court in the country in a bid to halt the apparent decay in the judiciary, often occasioned by indiscriminate granting of court orders and injunctions by some pliable judges who have by their dishonourable conduct brought the Bench to disrepute.\n\nSome of the states Chief Justices invited before the NJC include that of Rivers, Anambra, Jigawa, Kebbi, Imo and Cross River.\n\nA copy of the letter of invitation seen by THISDAY indicated that the affected Chief Judges are to appear before the Chief Justice of Nigeria, as a prelude to the larger one by the NJC to explain what warranted issuance of conflicting orders by courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\nWhile the High Courts of Imo, Jigawa and Anambra need to explain their roles in the Anambra governorship election, the High Courts of Rivers, Kebbi and Cross River on the other hand are involved in the case of the PDP Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the CJN complained bitterly on the huge embarrassment caused the Nigerian judiciary by the actions of those who issued the conflicting orders upon ex-parte applications by some politicians.\n\nThe summons dated August 30, 2021, read in part: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to media reports to the effect that some Courts of coordinate jurisdiction were granting conflicting Exparte Orders on the same subject matter.\n\n\u201cIt has become expedient for me to invite you for a detailed briefing on the development.\n\n\u201cThis is even more compelling having regard to earlier NJC Warning to judicial officers on the need to be circumspect in granting Exparte applications\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), which shared same position as the CJN, has also condemned the now rife development, saying it would be willing to sanction any member found wanting.\n\nTHISDAY, yesterday, had observed and exclusively reported the menace of indiscriminate issuance of injunctions and orders, which it reckoned if not checked could derail the country\u2019s hard-earned democracy as the 2023 general election began to gather momentum.\n\nIn the last two months, several orders and counter orders had been issued against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), particularly, as it related to the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State.\n\nOn one occasion, the court had ordered the electoral umpire to recognise a particular aspirant as the candidate of a political party and within a short while, another order of court equal jurisdiction had directed INEC to drop that person and, in his stead, fill in another person.\n\nAs at today, it\u2019s hard to say between a former Central Bank Governor, Chukwuma Soludo and Chukwuma Umeoji, who would finally be on the ballot for the All Progressives Grand Alliance or who would finally be governor assuming APGA won the election as both parties will certainly fight to the finish, up to the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, worried by the development, the CJN summoned the heads of those courts involved in what is becoming a real threat to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nUnlike other times that the National Judicial Council (NJC) would wait for a petition from the public before investigating and disciplining any erring judge, the CJN has on his own taken the decision to look into the issue and might wield the big stick on the erring justices.\n\nAlthough this is not the first time the intervention of the courts have threatened the nation\u2019s democracy, this instance has generated real worries about the future of the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nJustice Bassey Ikpeme of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court was the first to attempt to truncate Nigeria\u2019s democracy, when on June 10, 1993, he issued a restraining order on the then electoral umpire from going ahead with the scheduled June 12, 1993 presidential election.\n\nThe judge had granted the order despite clear provisions of Decree number 13, which stated that no court of law could interfere with conduct of the election.\n\nThe restraining order was sequel to an exparte application by a shadow organisation, the Association of Better Nigeria (ABN), led by a disqualified presidential aspirant in the person of Arthur Nzeribe, now late.\n\nThe National Election Commission (NEC) had though defied the order and went ahead to conduct the presidential election as scheduled on June 12, 1993, the commission was however restrained from going ahead to release the results of the election.\n\nBut, while the candidate of the defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Moshood Abiola, was already on the cusp of victory after leading in 15 states where election results were announced, Justice Saleh had in a ruling on an ex-parte application on June 15, 1993 stopped NEC from further announcement of the election results.\n\nAnd due to the actions of the court, Abiola till his death never became president as the former Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida, annulled the election, adjudged the freest and fairest at the time in Africa.\n\nIn this fourth democracy, the intervention of the court also made somebody, Rotimi Amaechi, who did not contest an election in 2007 to be governor of Rivers State.\n\nThe court had hinged its decision on the grounds that it was a political party that contested election and not an individual. Although the court has found a way of correcting itself after it later held in another case that for a candidate to be declared winner, he must participate in all the processes of an election.\n\nThirty years after the first attempt, some judges are still in the habit of doing the biddings of money bags against the interest of the country, legal profession and even the oath of office they swore to.\n\nAccording to some public analysts, the development has since put the nation\u2019s judiciary in a big mess.\n\nBefore the suspension and return to office orders on the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, by three High Courts in Rivers, Kebbi and Cross River States, former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, was also last year before his sack by the APC National Working Committee (NWC) restrained and later ordered back to office by High Courts in FCT, Abuja, Benin and Kano. Court order are now so cheap that they now worth less than the paper they are written on.\n\nAnalysts, however, stressed that the judges are not alone in this trade, because according to them, some very senior lawyers share in the blame, by the way and manner they file frivolous applications. \u201cIt is the willingness of the judges to entertain these applications and issue consequential orders that has baffled many.\u201d\n\nThese senior lawyers allegedly go from court to court shopping for interim injunctions. Only last year, the apex court, while delivering ruling in an application for the court to review and vacate its own judgment, slammed a whopping N30 million each on two very senior lawyers.\n\nJustice Amina Augie, who had read the ruling of the Supreme Court with tears in her eyes lamented that, \u201cvery senior\u201d lawyers were responsible for filing the suit.\n\nRegrettably however, nothing till date has been done to deter such apart from small fines that make no dent in the pockets of such lawyers.\n\nThis development is fast making people to lose faith in the judicial system and if not checked, lawyers and judges might put the country in bigger problem, because according to the analysts, the situation in Nigeria, \u201cis unbelievably very bad. Black market injunctions are dished out on a daily basis to the highest bidder. The courts no longer dispense justice. They merely dish out orders to whoever can afford them.\u201d\n\nSharing the same position as the CJN, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) also yesterday waded into the development, saying it would punish any member found wanting.\n\nThe NBA said it \u201chas observed with dismay the unfortunate and recurring trend of contradictory court decisions and orders, especially, among courts of coordinate jurisdiction, typically arising from exparte applications and almost always in political matters.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by its President, Mr. Olumide Akpata, the NBA chided especially, senior lawyers for the malaise, saying, \u201cAstonishingly, that commitment (to the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners 2007) is now being threatened by the conduct of some of our own members, the majority of whom are senior members of the Bar, who continue to yield themselves to be used as willing tools by politicians to wantonly abuse the judicial process.\u201d\n\nIndicating that it might sanction erring members going forward, the NBA said, \u201cBy the issuance of this statement, the NBA confirms unequivocally that it will not stand by and watch a ridiculing of the profession and the justice administration system by a handful of its members and will be considering its deterrence options in this regard.\u201d\n\nWhile not sparing the judiciary in the debacle, the NBA said, \u201cThe Bench, respectfully, is also not blameless. We certainly concur with the Honourable Justice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of the Court of Appeal in her condemnation of the indulgence by some judicial officers of politicians, who go round the country shopping for judgments, and who thereby bring the Judiciary to public ridicule.\u201d\n\nAkpata said the NBA would \u201curgently seek audience with the Honourable Chief Justice of Nigeria to address this issue holistically,\u201d adding that he would \u201cenlist the support of the Chairman of the NBA Judiciary Committee, Dr. Babatunde Ajibade, SAN as well as the Chairpersons of the NBA Section of Legal Practice (NBA-SLP) and NBA Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), Mr. Oluwaseun Abimbola, SAN and Dr. Monday Ubani for this proposed engagement.\u201d\n\nTwo Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN), Dayo Akinlaja and Abdul Mohammed, while reacting to the CJN moves, welcomed the invitation extended to the chief judges by Muhammad\n\nAkinlaja said the decision by the CJN to stop judges wading into political issues was \u2018a pleasant and heartwarming development.\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the spate of conflicting orders from the courts of late has been extremely troubling and disquieting.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor any discerning mind, the idea of giving conflicting orders of injunction does not bode well at all for our justice sector. It is axiomatic that justice is rooted in confidence. A situation, where conflicting orders of injunction is the order of the day, doubtless, fundamentally erodes the confidence the public might otherwise have in the judiciary.\u201d\n\nHe stated that as the chairman of NJC, it was not out of place for the CJN to issue the letters of invitation to the various heads of the courts.\n\n\u201cIt is my personal wish and desire that all that is needful is done to nip in the bud the new wave of abuse of ex parte injunctions. Our nation is at crossroads at the moment on all fronts. The judiciary is highly critical if we must make a headway out of the disturbing state of affairs in the country. In light of this, all hands must be on deck to prevent the judiciary from losing the trust and confidence of the public.\n\n\u201cTo me, the CJN deserves the felicitations of us all for rising, as it were, to the occasion. It is a case of a stitch in time saves nine,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso reacting, a former President of Lagos State Court of Arbitration, Mr. Yemi Candide-Johnson (SAN) said the recent wave of conflicting court judgement showed the recklessness of the judiciary.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, Candide-Johnson said the federal system of governance which the country operates is founded on separation of powers and rule of law.\n\nHe added that the rule of law is the most important aspect of any constitutional and legal arrangement and therefore identifies how important the judiciary is.\n\nCandide-Johnson was of the opinion that the Judiciary could only maintain its status as the guarantor of rights of individuals and of rights of government if the judiciary is competent, independent and impartial.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAnd decisions like these\u2026which indicates the lack of consistency and very often the recklessness of consequences of decisions to be taken. It seems to me that they have so severely damaged the reputation and credibility of the judiciary that it has become ineffective for the purpose of which it was been established \u2013 which is to maintain the stability of our government, our democracy and the safety and conduct of our people.\n\n\u201cIf people can\u2019t have confidence in the independence and impartiality, the competence being assumed of judges, then the entire system will come into a grounding halt and there would be disorder.\u201d\n\nOn the summon of the judges, Candide-Johnson noted that the CJN does not have the power to sanction the judges, saying the Chief Judge of respective states should be directly held responsible.\n\nCandide-Johnson stressed that he has no doubt that one of the judges was guilty of judicial misconduct.\n\nHe added: \u201cLet me start by correctly characterizing what appears to have gone wrong with these decisions. There is no doubt in my mind that one or more of those judges is guilty of judicial misconduct. And if in a series of high profile cases, inconsistent decisions were given by Judges across States and judges of coordinate jurisdiction, I myself will consider that there was warrant for a corruption enquiry.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s being said, the CJN, although he has no direct supervisory authority over individual judges, he has the responsibility as the leader of Nigerian Judiciary\u2026in that regard, he has the very least the powers, not coercive power, but we must recognised the fact that judicial discipline is going to come before a committee that he chairs.\n\n\u201cNow, for a judge in a state to give a decision which may well prove to be unfounded and potentially corrupt, the Chief Judge of the state is the person to be held directly responsible. Because the assignment of cases in the state, is a part that belongs to the Chief Judge and if the Chief Judge cannot guarantee that the judges he assigns the cases to or he allows to have cases assigned to them and to conduct themselves in a way that is responsible, that is lawful and that is credible. One needs to wonder about the confidence and the capacity of the Chief judge.\u201d\n\nCandide-Johnson noted that there is a mechanism for disciplining judges through the National Judicial Council (NJC) but added that it has a cumbersome procedure.\n\nHe explained that the NJC was primarily concerned with the integrity and the dignity of judges rather than the effectiveness of their functions to the people and accountability to the people who they serve\n\nCandide-Johnson said if the people have no confidence in the judges, they have already failed in their function, stressing that the system of accountability needs to be improved to a great degree\n\nMohammed, on his part, said the invitation was a right step in the right direction, wondering why the judges would issue the orders they granted without hearing the other parties.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Supreme Court in the case of Onuoha v Okafor (1983) 2 SCNLR has since settled the question of jurisdiction of court to determine issues of membership of political parties.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court in the recent case of of PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. SENATOR ALI MODU SHERRIF & ORS (2017) LPELR-42736(SC) reiterated the point that issues of leadership of political parties are political questions, which the courts do not exercise jurisdiction over.\n\n\u201cThough facts have their peculiarities, trials courts must be weary of politicians, who use the courts to play political theatrics.\u201d\n\nAlso, a legal commentator stated, \u201cNigerian judge could restrain God Almighty Himself from the very thing that gave us life: creation. You read lawyers asking the court to restraint the president from traveling or restrain the National Assembly from making laws or mandate the National Assembly to support Biafra. The jurisprudence is all over the place. You can literally choose what results you want and find the line of case to get whatever.\u201d\n\nWhile likening Nigerian law to Nigeria, he said, \u201cNo sensible foreign company including those operating in Nigeria today ever agrees to use Nigerian law as applicable law in their contracts with Nigerian entities or Nigeria courts as forum convenience. Even local companies doing business in Nigeria are resorting to foreign laws and foreign jurisdictions for dispute resolution.\n\n\u201cOur legal jurisprudence suffers and local lawyers continue to suffer in terms of capacity development. Today, foreign law firms are beginning to encroach into practices that Nigerian law firms should ordinarily be engaged in.\n\n\u201cThe big foreign law firms like Dentons, White and Case, Skadden Apps, Ashurst, Norton Rose etc are setting up offices in Nigeria and using their vast experience garnered from practice in multiple jurisdictions to scoop out most of the juicy briefs in telecoms, oil and gas, financing, mergers and acquisitions, trademarks etc. I wonder how many of the known local law firms in Nigeria will still be in existence in the next 15 to 20 years.\u201d\n\nHe concluded that Lawyers who aid in the destruction of the nation\u2019s judicial system would one day wake up to realise that the courts have become like motor parks, where rickety injunctions could be obtained by agberos.\n\nAlthough the CJN has taken a very commendable step, Nigerians would be waiting to see what will come out of it, because \u201cdisciplinary process is slow and at times difficult to activate. In the end, no one gets punished,\u201d another lawyer said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Declares president\u2019s administration has changed the tide\n\n\u2022Lawan applauds ongoing surrender by terrorists, rallies support for initiative\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Shehu of Borno, Abubakar El-Kanemi, yesterday, said the people of Borno State were lucky to have President Muhammadu Buhari in government as his reign has changed the tide against insecurity significantly.\n\nThis is as the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has also lent his support to the Boko Haram terrorists turning themselves in to the Nigerian troops, saying the move should be seen as a welcome development and should be encouraged to end insurgency in the NorthEast.\n\nThe Shehu of Borno, who spoke when Lawan paid him a courtesy call over the loss of his elder brother, said his people had \u201cseriously suffered as a result of Boko Haram crisis,\u201d but added that they were \u201clucky\u201d to have the Buhari government, which eventually changed the tide.\n\nAccording to him, all the local government areas in the state, which were under the control of Boko Haram had been taken back by the troops, adding that normal business activities had also returned in the state.\n\nHe also rejoiced at the news that Boko Haram elements were surrendering, saying, \u201cit\u2019s a welcome development\u201d, because \u201cBorno is a home of peace and we are for peace.\u201d\n\nRecently, there had been reported cases of thousands of Boko Haram insurgents laying down their arms and surrendering to government troops in the North East zone.\n\nSpecifically, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State disclosed last week at the State House, Abuja, that 2,600 repentant Boko Haram insurgents were currently being profiled in Maiduguri by the state government in collaboration with the military and other security agencies.\n\nBut Lawan, who spoke Monday in Maiduguri, Borno State capital, at the Palace of Shehu of Borno, in company with the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, used the opportunity of the visit to reassure the Borno people that the federal government would continue to work with the state to restore peace and stability in the region.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity to mention that the federal government of Nigeria will continue to work with Borno State government to ensure that there is restoration of peace and stability in this state and in this part of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed that the recent surrender by Boko Haram elements was a good development for the security of the country.\n\nLawan emphasised that the federal government needed to work with the Borno State government and other states in the North East geo-political zone to ensure that the Boko Haram elements that have been received were appropriately processed.\n\nHe said: \u201cThose that have no issues to answer are sanitised and taking back to their communities. Those that may have issues to answer should be taken through the legal processes but we must ensure that we encourage Boko Haram elements and those they have taken by force to come out to surrender so that this unnecessary insurgency placed on us comes to an end.\n\n\u201cI believe there is no need for any controversy over what we need to do with people, who surrendered. In any war, in every war, surrender is the ultimate and if we can achieve it, we should do everything and anything possible to encourage more and more to come out so that we are able to come to the end of this unnecessary insurgency that has taken our states back for so many years in terms of development.\n\n\u201cYour Royal Highness, I want to also commend the Governor of Borno State, our brother and friend, who has shown so much commitment, dedication and leadership in ensuring that Borno State, as much as possible, is safe and the people of this state are protected from insurgency.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is devoting so much resources for our security agencies to fight and bring insecurity to an end. Recently, the National Assembly approved over 800 billion naira for our security agencies in a supplementary budget and Mr. President has assured us that he will bring more request for more resources for our security agencies in 2022 appropriation bill, which may be presented at the end of September by the Grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe pray Almighty God to continue to guide our leaders at all levels, to protect our leaders at all levels and of course, to protect the people of this country,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Rulings for sale to highest bidder\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe increasing meddlesome interventions of the judiciary in almost every stratum of the political turf is fast threatening the nation\u2019s hard earned democracy and becoming a source of concern to stakeholders, especially, as the country moves closer to the 2023 elections.\n\nFrom Port Harcourt to Kebbi and then, Calabar as seen in the past few days in the Peoples Democratic (PDP) as well as events leading to the Anambra gubernatorial election, stakeholders are worried that the trend signposts possible dangers ahead, even as they rebuked members of the judiciary for making themselves readily available for the dirty biddings of politicians.\n\nThe courts, many well-meaning Nigerians are worried, might have become a market place for politicians to buy injunctions and exparte orders, and at the rate things are going, it may be difficult to draw the lines that Judges will not cross just to do the bidding of politicians.\n\nThe ease with which judges allow themselves to be manipulated by senior lawyers in pursuit of narrow self-interest is baffling to many, who now see the judiciary as a major threat to the nation\u2019s democracy. Some of the actions of judges defy logic and reason causing the layman on the street to ask questions and raise suspicion of underhand dealings.\n\n\u201cThe situation is now embarrassing. It is now so easy for any group to move into any court to get a judgment. All they need do is to get a pliant judge. It is unfortunate that the judges are the ones that determine, who holds political position in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are so many interventions by the judiciary across the country. They make governors, senators; they issue injunctions and they now sell injunctions. You have case in Akwa Ibom, you go to Sokoto to get a judgment and then INEC has to obey. So, it is an abuse. With the way they are going, you can even get an injunction for marriages in Jigawa,\u201d a senior lawyer, who pleaded to remain anonymous, said.\n\nFor instance, in the PDP, early last week, a High Court in Rivers State, had issued an order of interim injunction, restraining Uche Secondus from carrying on as national chairman of the party, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office.\n\nSecondus, according to the ruling, had been ordered to stop parading himself as a member of the PDP on grounds of his suspension from the party.\n\nJustice O. Gbasam of the Degema Division of a High Court of Rivers State, sitting in Port Harcourt, had issued the orders while delivering ruling in an exparte application by some chieftains of the PDP in Rivers State.\n\nBut two days after, Justice Nusirat. I. Umar, a vacation Judge of the Kebbi State High Court of coordinate jurisdiction with the one in Rivers State and who was clearly aware of the case already in Rivers State, not only entertained the case, she gave her own orders restoring the embattled National Chairman of the party to his position.\n\nThis was after the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Party, Elder Yemi Akinwomi, had assumed leadership of the PDP in acting capacity.\n\nIn a suit brought before her in Birinin Kebbi, the state capital in case KB/AC/M. 170/2021, Justice Umar said she was satisfied after reading the affidavit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\n\u201cAn order of this Honourable court granting leave to the first respondent (Uche Secondus) to continue exercising all the constitutional powers of the office of Chairman of PDP (second defendant) as enshrined in both 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as amended and the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s constitution pending the hearing and final determination of applicant\u2019s motion on notice,\u201d the order stated.\n\nRegrettably, 24-hours after the Kebbi State ruling, the crisis in the political party took a new twist as this time another court in Calabar, Cross River State, further restrained Secondus from parading himself as chairman as well as from presiding over the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party held at the weekend.\n\nAny right thinking person will know that something was surely wrong with a system that tolerates such abuse and mockery of such a critical arm of state. But Judges and many senior lawyers appear to care less about the consequential implications of their behaviour, which had brought disrepute and dishonour to the judiciary.\n\nThe interim order was issued by the court, presided over by Justice Edem Kufre, last Friday, upon an application brought by a member of the party, Enang Wani.\n\nThe situation is not different in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), which had also been engulfed with leadership squabble between the Jude Okeke and Victor Oye factions. This has seen leaders of the same party move from one court to the other shopping for injunction in their quest to control the party and ensure their candidates are recognised ahead of the November gubernatorial election, thus further polarising the party.\n\nIn the case of the APGA, former Cnetral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Chukwuma Soludo is having a running battle with Chukwuma Umeoji. The litigations are tied to who is the authentic Chairman of APGA in Anambra State amongst Chief Victor Oye, Chief Njoku and Jude Okeke.\n\nMeanwhile, judges in Anambra, Jigawa, Imo and Abuja have intervened in the matter causing INEC to at various times list and delist both the names of Soludo and Umeoji as candidate of APGA.\n\nThe electoral umpire had on July 16 published the name of Umeoji as the APGA candidate following an order by the Jigawa State High Court on June 28.\n\nOn July 18 justice Charles Okaa of Anambra State High Court directed INEC to publish Soludo\u2019s name as APGA\u2019s candidate. Meanwhile justice Iheka of the Imo State High Court again ordered INEC to publish Umeoji\u2019s name.\n\nReacting to the confusion, Justice Nwosu-Iheme berated the judges for indulging politicians, who go round the country shopping for judgments to enable them be on the ballot. According to her, the judges, who indulge these politicians are bringing the legal profession to public ridicule.\n\nThe PDP in Anambra State is in a terrible position as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) presently does not recognise either the Valentine Ozigbo or Senator Ugochukwu Uba factions, because of a plethora court injunctions.\n\nA former National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, was also removed after legal fireworks that saw the former labour leader and his then rivals from the Federal High Court in Kano, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, among others, in the battle for the soul of the party.\n\nSome three weeks ago, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) warned that except the leadership of both the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and the National Judicial Council (NJC) intervened, the seemingly endless and conflicting court orders over political parties\u2019 affairs could jeopardise preparations for the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC, which lamented the level of distraction the commission had begun to face as a result of litigations arising from the Anambra State governorship primary elections, however, restated its commitment to the use of technology in conducting elections, because it was the only way to credible and transparent polls.\n\nWhile maintaining that new and conflicting court orders from all parts of the country kept flooding its headquarters on a daily basis, the commission said it was not only frustrating but also causing it to keep recognising one candidate over the other, and changing same again in the major political parties.\n\nNational Commissioner for Voter Education, Festus Okoye, who hinted at the concerns in Awka, Anambra State, said, \u201cThis (litigations) is frustrating. What the commission does in terms of obedience to court orders is that if a judgment comes today, the commission obeys the order, because it is the latest in time.\n\n\u201cIf on the same issue, another court of coordinate jurisdiction, or from a court of another judicial division comes to us, because that one is the latest in time, the commission obeys that one.\n\n\u201cSo, what the political parties have been doing, and what they are doing is that they anticipate the commission, and the moment you\u2019re proceeding, they get court orders. This is impeding our performance and making things difficult.\n\n\u201cElections require sanctity and adherence to guidelines, the leadership of the NBA and the NJC should look at this. This is urgent and imperative, because if it persists, this can jeopardise the conduct of the 2023 general election. We are having court orders on a daily basis from courts in all parts of the country and that is not right.\u201d\n\nAlthough sections of the country\u2019s constitution and the Electoral Act allow the judiciary, (courts and election tribunals) to intervene particularly, when issues of non-compliance, manipulation, violence etc are alleged to mar the process of electing a particular representative, however, recent developments seems to portray the fact that these days, the judges rather than the people choose the leaders.\n\nA peculiar case in recent times is that of a South Eastern State where the governor was referred to as the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d governor, simply because he was declared winner of the 2019 governorship election, after coming a distant fourth in the poll.\n\nThe intervention of the courts whether at pre-election cases or election petitions are taking a worrisome dimension as their judgments to most aggrieved parties and even the people seem to be far from justice, particularly, when such courts or judges lacked the necessary jurisdiction in the first place to hear the case brought before them.\n\nThe situation, was so bad that sometime last year, former Chief Judge of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Justice Ishaq Bello had to issue a practice directive warning justice against delving into cases outside their jurisdiction as well as issuing all sorts of retraining orders in election matters.\n\nBut it seems the warning may have fallen on deaf ears as the situation rather than abating is getting worse. Only recently, a Justice of the Court of Appeal, Chioma Nwosu-Iheme, while delivering judgment called for the punishment of a Jigawa State High Court judge, Justice Ubale and his Imo State counterpart, Justice B. C. Iheka over what she described as professional misconduct by dabbling into the Anambra State gubernatorial election controversy and gave consequential judgments on it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria's Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, is currently sponsoring a bill before the National Assembly to take over prosecuting and investigative powers of all the law enforcement agencies in the country.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the move by Malami is to stall the prosecution of high-profile corruption and criminal cases in order to protect his allies from facing justice.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nThe bill tagged \u201cThe Prosecution Of Offences in Nigeria Act, 2017\u201d if passed into law by the National Assembly will allow the office of the AGF to take over the conduct or discontinue criminal proceedings.\n\n\u201cResponsibilities to institute or take over the conduct of proceedings. Procedural requirements for taking over of criminal proceedings,\u201d Part V of the bill seen by SaharaReporters read.\n\n\u201cProcedural requirements for discontinuance of proceedings. Discontinuance of proceedings after accused has been sent for trial.\n\n\u201cAssuming Conduct of prosecution by the Attorney-General. Review of prosecution powers of law enforcement agencies etc. Review of investigations conducted by law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cPower to conduct investigation. Power under the Extradition Act. Conduct of criminal proceedings by persons other than a Prosecuting Officer.\u201d\n\nPart V Section 20(1)(a)(b) further stated in part, \u201cSubject to the exercise of the powers of the Attorney\u2013General for public prosecutions under the Constitution and the provisions of other applicable laws, rules or regulations and notwithstanding the provisions of Part II of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 on the control of criminal proceedings, the Prosecution Authority, under the directions of the Director shall, with effect from the date of commencement of this Act, be responsible for \u2013 conducting criminal proceeding against any accused person before any court in Nigeria in respect of any offence created by or under any Act of the National Assembly; taking over the conduct of criminal proceedings, instituted by any law enforcement agency, including the Police.\u201d\n\nPart V Section 20\n\nPart V Section 24 is titled \u2018Assuming conduct of prosecution by the Attorney-General\u2019.\n\nThe section says, \u201cNotwithstanding the provision of this Act, or any other power conferred on the Director under this Act or any other Act, the Attorney-General may after notifying the Director, intervene in the first instance or on appeal where, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, the proceedings raise questions of public interest.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General may only assume conduct of a prosecution after consulting the Director on the matter and giving notice to the Director of his intention to assume conduct of the prosecution.\n\n\u201cOn the receipt of the notice referred to in subsection (2) of this section, the Director shall turn the prosecution file over to the Attorney-General and provide any information that the Attorney-General may require on the matter within the time specified.\u201d\n\nPart V Section 24\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the bill is expected to be presented to heads of law enforcement agencies tomorrow (Tuesday, August 31, 2021) at a meeting convened by the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) Monitoring Committee Secretary, Sulayman Dawudu.\n\nThey are to be blackmailed, intimidated and forced to endorse the \u2018satanic\u2019 bill secretly sponsored by the AGF, a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cMalami to re-enact the surreptitious takeover of the prosecution of corruption cases in the country and return it to ground zero,\u201d the source added.\n\n\u201cThe publicly criticised bill on creation of public prosecution authority, prepared in 2017 has resurfaced within the government by the Ministry of Justice through its ACJA monitoring Committee, Secretary, Sulayman Dawudu.\n\n\u201cThis bill purporting to take over all prosecuting and investigative powers of all the law enforcement agencies in the country is to be presented to the law enforcement agencies tomorrow Tuesday, August 31, 2021 at a meeting convened by the ACJA monitoring committee to blackmail and intimidate leaderships of the law enforcement into endorsement.\n\n\u201cThe bill is in all intent, purposes and activities in contravention of international standards in the fight against corruption; it leaves the fight against corruption in the control and manipulation of a political appointee in the person of Attorney General; it creates another agencies with investigation and prosecution over and above trained law enforcement agencies; it conflicts with the laws establishing all the law enforcement agencies; and will frustrate and demoralise the law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General who had bared his fangs recently with the withdrawal of his political associates like Danjuma Goge and others will have the express power to kill cases where he has interests.\u201d\n\nDOCUMENT: Prosecution of Offences in Nigeria Gom[2] by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nImplications Of Having The \u2018Satanic\u2019 Bill Passed\n\nIdentifying some of the implications of having the bill passed into law, an expert in legal matters noted that the \u201cbill essentially kills the independence of the ACAs (Anti-Corruption Agencies), whereby they will be subservient to other authorities in the course of their investigation and or prosecution\u201d.\n\nThe expert further noted, \u201cThe track records on investigation and prosecution of the office of the HAGF (Honourable Attorney General of the Federation) are nothing to write home about in comparison to the stellar prosecutorial outcomes of the Anti-Corruption Agencies (ACAs), especially the EFCC.\n\n\u201cConsequent to the above, the incompetent cannot school or attempt to school the competent.\n\n\u201cThis is creating another bureaucracy in the face of crushing debt profile of Federal Government of Nigeria and rather insensitive at this time.\n\n\u201cThe progenitor, who is attempting to resurrect this bill, ought to face his primary responsibility of monitoring the Administration of Criminal Justice Act rather than creating unnecessary administrative chasms just as he tried to do with the botched EFCC repeal and establishment bill that the HAGF had to publicly dissociate himself from.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the DPP (Directorate of Public Prosecutions) is already there as well as that of the Solicitor General of the Federal Government of Nigeria and this bill will be superfluous in the face of these and also, the Legal Departments and Investigators within the ACAs will be certainly thrown into confusion if this bill sees the light of day.\n\n\u201cThe political backlash of this will be a major distraction for Mr. President, as this will clearly be seen as immoral when you attempt to give such sweeping powers to a card-carrying politician and political appointee.\n\n\u201cIf the office and person of the Attorney General was separated from the office and person of the Minister of Justice, then certain aspects of the proposal may be considered, but when one person is holding the two offices, this bill cannot but be used as a political tool to tie the hands of the ACAs, embark on political vendettas or even frustrate many high profile cases of perceived party faithful.\n\n\u201cIf this process or workshop or meeting tomorrow is being sponsored by any development partner such as ROLAC, etc, they should be alerted that they are indirectly meddling with the fight against corruption and the process of instituting good governance and accountability in the country.\u201d\n\nBrief History Of Malami\u2019s Fraudulent Interference With Law Processes\n\nIn 2020, Malami grabbed the headlines after taking over the case involving Bala Hamisu Wadume, a notorious kidnapper.\n\nSee Also CRIME Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami, Takes Over Prosecution Of Kidnapper, Wadume\n\nSome soldiers had killed three policemen in Taraba State while Wadume was being taken to the police headquarters in Jalingo, the state capital.\n\nWadume was later re-arrested in Kano and is facing prosecution alongside Tijjani Balarabe, an army captain; and 18 others on a 16 counts bordering on terrorism by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu.\n\nHowever, the matter took a new turn when a lawyer from the Ministry of Justice, Shuaibu Labaran, informed the court that Malami would be taking over the case.\n\nThe action attracted reactions with many saying the AGF was plotting to kill the case, going by his past record.\n\nSee Also Corruption Top Controversial Cases Taken Over By Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami, And How They Ended\n\nAlso in 2020, the AGF took over the money laundering trial of Akinola Ogunlewe being handled by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nAt the continuation of the trial on March 10, 2020, Labaran told the court that Malami had shown interest to take over the matter.\n\nIn view of the interest shown by the AGF, counsel for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth defendants, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), and the prosecution counsel, Bala Sanga, agreed to return before the court on April 7, 2020 to report on an out-of-court settlement.\n\nThat was the last heard of the matter as Ogunlewe walked away a free person.\n\nAnother case taken over by Malami was the N25 billion fraud trial of Danjuma Goje, former governor of Gombe State.\n\nThe case was stalled when in an emergency hearing before Justice Babatunde Quadiri, EFCC counsel, Wahab Shittu told the court that the agency was withdrawing from the case and handing it over to the office of the Attorney-General for continuation.\n\nThe AGF, however, stated that having thoroughly reviewed the matter, he found no prima facie case while adding that it was weak.\n\nHe, therefore, withdrew the charges against Goje from the court in exercise of his constitutional power.\n\nThe withdrawal of the cases by the AGF made Goje a free man.\n\nAnother of such corruption and controversial case taken over by the office of the AGF was the alleged debts of N242 billion and $1.3bn owed by MTN for its business malpractices in the country.\n\nMTN announced that it received through its counsel, Wole Olanipekun (SAN), a letter from the AGF formally withdrawing his demand for N242,244,452,215.97 and USD$1,283,610,357.86 alleged revenue indebtedness.\n\nAccording to MTN, while the AGF had dropped his demand, he, however, referred the matter to the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Nigeria Customs Service to resolve the controversy.\n\nThe matter has since fizzled into oblivion.\n\nAlso, in 2017, Malami ensured the withdrawal of an ongoing corruption case involving three former officials \u2013 Nasiru Ingawa (former Special Adviser on SURE-P (Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme) to former Governor Ibrahim Shema), Abdulazeez Shinkafi (former Director of Finance and Account at the Katsina State SURE-P department) and Bello Bindawa (former Chief Store Officer in the Katsina State civil service) who were prosecuted for allegedly mismanaging N5.7 billion SURE-P funds.\n\nHowever, on October 25, 2017, the Katsina State Attorney-General, Ahmed El-Marzuqat, notified the court that the state government was taking over the prosecution of the accused persons from the ICPC (Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission) following a fiat from the office of the AGF to take over the prosecution of the case.\n\nAfter a slow prosecution by the state government, the Katsina State High Court terminated the corruption trial of the three persons.\n\nThe AGF was also accused of stopping the prosecution of former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, for allegedly forging the Senate rules to conduct the election of principal officers of the upper legislative chamber.\n\nIn 2019, the Concerned Football Patriots accused Malami of making frantic efforts to shield the President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, and other accused officials from being prosecuted for the alleged mismanagement of $9.5 million FIFA grant.\n\nWhile the case was going on, Malami reportedly sent Abubakar Musa, a lawyer in his office, to pray the court for an adjournment to allow the AGF harmonise all the cases in the various courts.\n\nAfter a month, the Nigerian government withdrew the case against Pinnick, NFF Secretary-General, Sanusi Mohammed; 1st Vice President, Seyi Akinwumi; 2nd Vice President, Shehu Dikko and an executive member, Yusuff Fresh.",

taking over the conduct of criminal proceedings, instituted by any law enforcement agency, including the Police.\u201d\n\nPart V Section 20\n\nPart V Section 24 is titled \u2018Assuming conduct of prosecution by the Attorney-General\u2019.\n\nThe section says, \u201cNotwithstanding the provision of this Act, or any other power conferred on the Director under this Act or any other Act, the Attorney-General may after notifying the Director, intervene in the first instance or on appeal where, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, the proceedings raise questions of public interest.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General may only assume conduct of a prosecution after consulting the Director on the matter and giving notice to the Director of his intention to assume conduct of the prosecution.\n\n\u201cOn the receipt of the notice referred to in subsection (2) of this section, the Director shall turn the prosecution file over to the Attorney-General and provide any information that the Attorney-General may require on the matter within the time specified.\u201d\n\nPart V Section 24\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the bill is expected to be presented to heads of law enforcement agencies tomorrow (Tuesday, August 31, 2021) at a meeting convened by the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) Monitoring Committee Secretary, Sulayman Dawudu.\n\nThey are to be blackmailed, intimidated and forced to endorse the \u2018satanic\u2019 bill secretly sponsored by the AGF, a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cMalami to re-enact the surreptitious takeover of the prosecution of corruption cases in the country and return it to ground zero,\u201d the source added.\n\n\u201cThe publicly criticised bill on creation of public prosecution authority, prepared in 2017 has resurfaced within the government by the Ministry of Justice through its ACJA monitoring Committee, Secretary, Sulayman Dawudu.\n\n\u201cThis bill purporting to take over all prosecuting and investigative powers of all the law enforcement agencies in the country is to be presented to the law enforcement agencies tomorrow Tuesday, August 31, 2021 at a meeting convened by the ACJA monitoring committee to blackmail and intimidate leaderships of the law enforcement into endorsement.\n\n\u201cThe bill is in all intent, purposes and activities in contravention of international standards in the fight against corruption; it leaves the fight against corruption in the control and manipulation of a political appointee in the person of Attorney General; it creates another agencies with investigation and prosecution over and above trained law enforcement agencies; it conflicts with the laws establishing all the law enforcement agencies; and will frustrate and demoralise the law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General who had bared his fangs recently with the withdrawal of his political associates like Danjuma Goge and others will have the express power to kill cases where he has interests.\u201d\n\nDOCUMENT: Prosecution of Offences in Nigeria Gom[2] by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nImplications Of Having The \u2018Satanic\u2019 Bill Passed\n\nIdentifying some of the implications of having the bill passed into law, an expert in legal matters noted that the \u201cbill essentially kills the independence of the ACAs (Anti-Corruption Agencies), whereby they will be subservient to other authorities in the course of their investigation and or prosecution\u201d.\n\nThe expert further noted, \u201cThe track records on investigation and prosecution of the office of the HAGF (Honourable Attorney General of the Federation) are nothing to write home about in comparison to the stellar prosecutorial outcomes of the Anti-Corruption Agencies (ACAs), especially the EFCC.\n\n\u201cConsequent to the above, the incompetent cannot school or attempt to school the competent.\n\n\u201cThis is creating another bureaucracy in the face of crushing debt profile of Federal Government of Nigeria and rather insensitive at this time.\n\n\u201cThe progenitor, who is attempting to resurrect this bill, ought to face his primary responsibility of monitoring the Administration of Criminal Justice Act rather than creating unnecessary administrative chasms just as he tried to do with the botched EFCC repeal and establishment bill that the HAGF had to publicly dissociate himself from.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the DPP (Directorate of Public Prosecutions) is already there as well as that of the Solicitor General of the Federal Government of Nigeria and this bill will be superfluous in the face of these and also, the Legal Departments and Investigators within the ACAs will be certainly thrown into confusion if this bill sees the light of day.\n\n\u201cThe political backlash of this will be a major distraction for Mr. President, as this will clearly be seen as immoral when you attempt to give such sweeping powers to a card-carrying politician and political appointee.\n\n\u201cIf the office and person of the Attorney General was separated from the office and person of the Minister of Justice, then certain aspects of the proposal may be considered, but when one person is holding the two offices, this bill cannot but be used as a political tool to tie the hands of the ACAs, embark on political vendettas or even frustrate many high profile cases of perceived party faithful.\n\n\u201cIf this process or workshop or meeting tomorrow is being sponsored by any development partner such as ROLAC, etc, they should be alerted that they are indirectly meddling with the fight against corruption and the process of instituting good governance and accountability in the country.\u201d\n\nBrief History Of Malami\u2019s Fraudulent Interference With Law Processes\n\nIn 2020, Malami grabbed the headlines after taking over the case involving Bala Hamisu Wadume, a notorious kidnapper.\n\nSee Also CRIME Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami, Takes Over Prosecution Of Kidnapper, Wadume\n\nSome soldiers had killed three policemen in Taraba State while Wadume was being taken to the police headquarters in Jalingo, the state capital.\n\nWadume was later re-arrested in Kano and is facing prosecution alongside Tijjani Balarabe, an army captain; and 18 others on a 16 counts bordering on terrorism by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu.\n\nHowever, the matter took a new turn when a lawyer from the Ministry of Justice, Shuaibu Labaran, informed the court that Malami would be taking over the case.\n\nThe action attracted reactions with many saying the AGF was plotting to kill the case, going by his past record.\n\nSee Also Corruption Top Controversial Cases Taken Over By Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami, And How They Ended\n\nAlso in 2020, the AGF took over the money laundering trial of Akinola Ogunlewe being handled by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nAt the continuation of the trial on March 10, 2020, Labaran told the court that Malami had shown interest to take over the matter.\n\nIn view of the interest shown by the AGF, counsel for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth defendants, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), and the prosecution counsel, Bala Sanga, agreed to return before the court on April 7, 2020 to report on an out-of-court settlement.\n\nThat was the last heard of the matter as Ogunlewe walked away a free person.\n\nAnother case taken over by Malami was the N25 billion fraud trial of Danjuma Goje, former governor of Gombe State.\n\nThe case was stalled when in an emergency hearing before Justice Babatunde Quadiri, EFCC counsel, Wahab Shittu told the court that the agency was withdrawing from the case and handing it over to the office of the Attorney-General for continuation.\n\nThe AGF, however, stated that having thoroughly reviewed the matter, he found no prima facie case while adding that it was weak.\n\nHe, therefore, withdrew the charges against Goje from the court in exercise of his constitutional power.\n\nThe withdrawal of the cases by the AGF made Goje a free man.\n\nAnother of such corruption and controversial case taken over by the office of the AGF was the alleged debts of N242 billion and $1.3bn owed by MTN for its business malpractices in the country.\n\nMTN announced that it received through its counsel, Wole Olanipekun (SAN), a letter from the AGF formally withdrawing his demand for N242,244,452,215.97 and USD$1,283,610,357.86 alleged revenue indebtedness.\n\nAccording to MTN, while the AGF had dropped his demand, he, however, referred the matter to the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Nigeria Customs Service to resolve the controversy.\n\nThe matter has since fizzled into oblivion.\n\nAlso, in 2017, Malami ensured the withdrawal of an ongoing corruption case involving three former officials \u2013 Nasiru Ingawa (former Special Adviser on SURE-P (Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme) to former Governor Ibrahim Shema), Abdulazeez Shinkafi (former Director of Finance and Account at the Katsina State SURE-P department) and Bello Bindawa (former Chief Store Officer in the Katsina State civil service) who were prosecuted for allegedly mismanaging N5.7 billion SURE-P funds.\n\nHowever, on October 25, 2017, the Katsina State Attorney-General, Ahmed El-Marzuqat, notified the court that the state government was taking over the prosecution of the accused persons from the ICPC (Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission) following a fiat from the office of the AGF to take over the prosecution of the case.\n\nAfter a slow prosecution by the state government, the Katsina State High Court terminated the corruption trial of the three persons.\n\nThe AGF was also accused of stopping the prosecution of former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, for allegedly forging the Senate rules to conduct the election of principal officers of the upper legislative chamber.\n\nIn 2019, the Concerned Football Patriots accused Malami of making frantic efforts to shield the President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, and other accused officials from being prosecuted for the alleged mismanagement of $9.5 million FIFA grant.\n\nWhile the case was going on, Malami reportedly sent Abubakar Musa, a lawyer in his office, to pray the court for an adjournment to allow the AGF harmonise all the cases in the various courts.\n\nAfter a month, the Nigerian government withdrew the case against Pinnick, NFF Secretary-General, Sanusi Mohammed; 1st Vice President, Seyi Akinwumi; 2nd Vice President, Shehu Dikko and an executive member, Yusuff Fresh.",

          "text": "A human rights organisation, Amnesty International has called on the Nigerian government to stop the enforced disappearance of defenceless citizens across the country.\n\nThe organisation revealed that many Nigerians whose whereabouts are unknown to their families are critics of the government, making it difficult to accept such fate with its malicious clampdown on its 'so-called' enemies.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\n\nIt made the disclosure in a press release titled, \u2018NIGERIA: Authorities Must End Enforced Disappearance\u2019, obtained by SaharaReporters on Monday being the International Day of Support for Victims of Enforced Disappearance.\n\nSpeaking on the cases of some instances of the Nigerian government\u2019s critics that cannot be found, AI said, \u201cThe Nigerian government must urgently address the heinous crimes of enforced disappearances, to comply with Nigeria\u2019s international law obligations, Amnesty International said today, on the International Day of Support for Victims of Enforced Disappeared.\n\n\u201cFamilies affected by enforced disappearance live through unimaginable torment. When people vanish without a trace, with the acquiescence of the state who then denies all knowledge, it\u2019s impossible to move on.\n\n\u201cEach year, this symbolic day marks families\u2019 daily wait for the truth of the fate of their disappeared relatives. The Nigerian authorities must bring them hope for justice, stop their delaying tactics and fulfil their promise to make an end of enforced disappearance.\u201d\n\nIn the statement, it gave another instance of a sister to a 33-year-old businessman who disappeared since August 2014 after arrest by the police.\n\nThe lady whose name was not revealed for security purposes said, \u201cMy brother\u2019s disappearance affected everyone at home. We just decided to leave everything to faith, hoping he will show up one day. But we need closure, for us to know what actually happened to him.

When people vanish without a trace, with the acquiescence of the state who then denies all knowledge, it\u2019s impossible to move on.\n\n\u201cEach year, this symbolic day marks families\u2019 daily wait for the truth of the fate of their disappeared relatives. The Nigerian authorities must bring them hope for justice, stop their delaying tactics and fulfil their promise to make an end of enforced disappearance.\u201d\n\nIn the statement, it gave another instance of a sister to a 33-year-old businessman who disappeared since August 2014 after arrest by the police.\n\nThe lady whose name was not revealed for security purposes said, \u201cMy brother\u2019s disappearance affected everyone at home.

          "title": "Incremental innovation with Nigerian healthtech startups",
          "text": "Hello everyone, let\u2019s get a little personal.\n\nLast week, I spent time in Warri \u2013 a city located in South-South Nigeria, notable for being an oil hub and popularizing the incredibly complex but impressive Warri pidgin language. My trip turned out to be an unexpectedly stressful event and by Sunday, I fell sick.\n\nNow falling sick wasn\u2019t an issue; the issue was that I\u2019d fallen sick on a Sunday and my accommodation was located in a small, but populated, community that didn\u2019t have a pharmacy within walking distance. Also, the mom and pop shops that littered every street around the hotel didn\u2019t open before noon on Sundays.\n\nAs my people say: I was in hot soup.\n\nThe hotel concierge had to walk a mile to buy a pack of Panadol for me, and for the hotel\u2019s First Aid box.\n\nPartner Message\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here.\n\nFirst dibs on Mega Cities\n\nBut while I was waiting and battling aches and pains, I couldn\u2019t help but wish I had access to a healthtech or telemedicine company that could deliver the medication I need right to my hotel room. Or better still, send a healthcare professional to run some tests and properly diagnose my symptoms.\n\nMy experience revealed two things: Nigeria needs more healthtech startups. And those startups need to have foot traffic in other cities and communities, outside Lagos and Abuja.\n\nWith a population of about 14million people, Lagos is Nigeria\u2019s busiest and most populated financial and commercial hub. The mega city also has thriving tech hubs scattered across diverse communities.\n\nSo of course you\u2019re going to see a growing number of founders setting up their business headquarters in Lagos. It makes business sense to penetrate at least 1% of the most populous market in Nigeria.\n\nBut there\u2019s a tendency for these founders to grow comfortable in Lagos, or eventually expand their businesses into neighboring South-West states like Ekiti, Ogun, and Ondo.\n\nComparatively speaking, there are more Fintech startups than healthtech/telemedicine in Nigeria. And out of that small crop of healthtech startups, at least 50% of them were founded in Lagos, and are currently serving customers in the megacity.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that some of these startups serve clients in states outside their HQ location\n\nPartner Message\n\nKB4-CON EMEA is a free, highly engaging, cybersecurity-focused virtual event designed for CISOs, security awareness and cybersecurity professionals in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The event will be on Thursday, September 23rd and features keynotes from two of the most well known figures in cybersecurity. Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen will cover how our global networks are being threatened by surveillance and crime, and how we can fix our technical, and human, problems. Kevin Mitnick will reveal social engineering tradecraft and insights and wow you with a live hacking demonstration. You can register here.\n\nIncremental innovation\n\nOf those Lagos headquartered health startups, only a small number of them are focused on delivering medication and home-based tests to their users.\n\nEven with over 2,000 registered private hospitals and more than 200 public health centers in Lagos, there\u2019s still a high percentage of underserved Lagos residents who can\u2019t afford basic medical care. Those who can afford a one-time hospital visit would rather self medicate or purchase analgesics (panadol, ibuprofen, etc) from a street vendor, but they stand the risk of buying expired drugs.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to ignore the need for telemedicine businesses in Lagos. But it\u2019s also crucial to remind prospective founders who want to break into Nigeria\u2019s health ecosystem that communities outside Lagos also need attention.\n\nFor Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson, founder and CEO of Healthtracka, launching in Lagos was deliberate, but her team is also keen to expand into more Nigerian cities and marginalized communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of people reach out to us from Abeokuta and Ibadan \u2013 they have a need for our services. They need tests done, but the nearest hospital is too far from them.\u201d Ifeoluwa said over our Zoom call.\n\nHealthtracka is a digital health platform that offers convenient at-home lab tests and provides their users with easy-to-read results.\n\n\u201cOne of the things about innovation in healthcare is that it has to be incremental. We have to first build confidence and trust in our prospective users. And building that trust will look different for people who live in Lagos and people who live outside Lagos.\u201d\n\nInnovating incrementally requires healthtech founders to spend time immersing themselves in unfamiliar markets and listening to the needs of their future customers.\n\n\u201cOver the next one year, I hope Healthtracka can expand into other cities outside Lagos. I\u2019m thinking Abeokuta, Ibadan, and even Warri. Lagos is an innovation centre, so it\u2019s good to start building here. Test your product in Lagos, and then expand into other communities using the lessons you\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n\nSo my challenge to emerging and prospective healthtech founders is this: can you spread health and digital innovation outside the commercial walls of Lagos?\n\nIt could be argued that larger commercial cities have higher purchasing power \u2013 and this argument is valid \u2013 but if innovation does not spread into the corridors of smaller emerging cities, their purchasing power will not be strong enough to partake in the digital economy.\n\nPartner Message\n\nDid you know that the US Stock markets have returned on average 10% annually for nearly a 100 years?

          "title": "How customer loyalty is helping Nigerian fintech apps through regulatory crackdown",
          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "MaxAB, an Egyptian eCommerce platform that serves food and grocery retailers, has raised an additional $15M from existing investors bringing its total Series A funding to $55M, the largest ever by an Egyptian startup.\n\nIn addition, it announced its acquisition of WaystoCap, a Morocco-based e-commerce and distribution platform that connects retailers with suppliers across Africa.\n\nFounded in 2015 by Niama El Bassunie, Mehdi Daoui, Anis Abdeddine and Aziz Jaouhari Tissafi, WaystoCap was originally a cross-border trade platform for transacting business goods in Africa. Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. It subsequently raised a $3 million seed round.\n\nWaystoCap expanded its cross-border services to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Lagos state has vowed to go ahead with collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) in the country\u2019s commercial capital even after the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) insists that it remains its sole responsibility to collect the taxes across the country.\n\nLagos has the backing of law to collect VAT in the state following a landmark court ruling in Rivers state which paved way for state governments to begin collection of VAT and Personal Income Tax (PIT) in their respective states.\n\nThe FIRS has appealed the court ruling and advised the public to maintain a status-quo on the payment of the taxes.\n\nUnder the Court of Appeal Act, an appeal does not operate as a stay of execution, which means states have the right to act on the court ruling to collect the specified taxes.\n\nGbenga Omotosho, commissioner for information and strategy, however, told BusinessDay on Monday that since the FIRS\u2019 appeal on the case to the Appeal Court does not translate to stay of execution on the judgment of the Federal High Court, Lagos will push ahead in VAT collection.\n\nRead also: Lagos DMO to secure fresh N185bn bond to fund projects\n\n\u201cAn appeal is not stay of execution.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said the Benin River Port project is critical and strategic to Nigeria\u2019s economy, noting that the state government is willing to partner with the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, (NIMASA) to bring the project to reality.\n\nObaseki disclosed this when he hosted the Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Jamoh, who led other members of the agency\u2019s management team on a courtesy visit to the Government House in Benin City.\n\nHe said Edo State is very unique in its ecology, which spans swamp, rain forest, and savanna planes, noting, \u201cThere is nothing we cannot grow here. With a port here, it is going to be a unique opportunity because it is not going to be moving traffic one way.\n\n\u201cFor us, agricultural activities will be further enhanced with the access this port will provide. The blue economy has always been critical to our growth as a people. I am very glad to inform you that over the last four years, a lot of work has gone on with the project.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhy is this important to us? The economy of Nigeria must be diversified.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a choice or an option. The global economy is going to be driven by other factors outside the traditional crude oil or the fuel economy that we are used to.\n\n\u201cWe are locating this port in a place that is perhaps Nigeria\u2019s largest and richest onshore gas reserve. You can imagine that this energy exists to drive whatever amount of industrialization that needs to be.\u201d\n\nEarlier, NIMASA DG, Jamoh had stressed that with the rise of alternative energy, countries are seeking green options to fossil fuel, noting that the maritime sector has the potential to grow Nigeria\u2019s revenue base.\n\nJamoh acknowledged that the Benin River Port project is a testament that Edo understands the benefits of shipping and expressed readiness to ensure the state explores the opportunities of the blue economy.\n\nHe noted that the NIMASA was ready to sponsor indigenes of the state to Greece on fully-funded scholarship to study Maritime Science.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nWarri \u2013 After the the unrest that trailed the Coronation of the 21st Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwase Ill, palpable calm indeed has returned to the ancient kingdom.\n\nHowever, expectations from sons and daughters of the kingdom and even neighbors are indeed very high as His Majesty , makes history as the youngest monarch to have ascended the throne of his forebearers.\n\nIn this interview, BETTY IDIALU speaks with Chief Brown Mene, the Ogwaolusan of Warri kingdom, who was also a member of the Olu Advisory Council . Despite his bold profession of his christian faith, he is an encyclopaedia of Itsekiri history, culture and tradition.\n\nHe bares his mind on the build-up of events leading to the Coronation of the 21st Olu.\n\nExcerpts.\n\nChief, much ado about the imbroglio that dogged the pre-olu Coronation era. How did it go and how did you win the battle?\n\nI\u2019ll give some background to enable you understand better. Our system of transition or succession is very simple and straight-forward which is why we have only one ruling house.\n\nThe transition is also from father to son; even though that is not automatic because a father may not have a son; or may have a son who is considered not suitable.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a room to have a pool to draw from aside the immediate children of the immediate past ruler.\n\nTherefore, we have the second-next and the third-next. By the time you get to that, you should be able to have enough to draw from. The responsibilities of the transition to getting to the conclusion is handled by two broad groups. The family, on one hand, and the chiefs, on the other.\n\nThe family has a responsibility to present a candidate, but following the due guidelines and when the candidate is agreed on among themselves, they will present him to the chiefs, this time, represented by seven chiefs: The Ojoye Ojisan, the same as we call The Olu Advisory Council.\n\nThey have a duty to screen the individual including taking him through the Oracle. And this is done not privately, but publicly.\n\nPublicly in the sense that all the seven chiefs will be there, members representing the family that presented him will also be there; and some other observers could be invited to be there. In the event of anyone being rejected, it will be in the full view of everyone. When such person is rejected, the chiefs will tell the family to bring somebody else. The chiefs have no responsibility, duty and privilege to have to jump into the family and pick anybody.\n\nWhat brought about the problem was that we know how long the process should take. For instance in 2015, the demise happened in September 2015, but by December 12, 2015, we had another Olu because it has been followed that way. So, the general people know how long it should take; even though they know what is happening, they would not dare say the king has joined his ancestors because they want it to be proclaimed the proper way. But if you unduly delay it, the people will now start to get restive. And what has prolonged it was that, though the family had played their role in presenting a candidate, the then Ologbotsere and chairman of the group of chiefs to handle this was then acting contrarily. When the date was set for that screening to happen, he would just wake up and leave town. He would leave and nobody knew when he\u2019d come back. This is something that happened in December. By February, March, someone had already been presented to the chiefs, but he refused to take it forward; so people were now becoming restless. And some of us chiefs, who felt whatever they were doing they were doing it on behalf of us the chiefs, so we met at the Council of Chiefs meeting, drew their attention to it, because when we heard a report from them, it dawned that it was only because Ayiri was acting unilaterally all the time and we had to say to them to go back, bearing in mind and recognizing the Ojoye Ojisan is not just one man, but seven of you. We told them to go and work together collectively.\n\nSecondly, we told them \u201cwhere you had reached, carry on from there and give to us chiefs, the timetable on the various steps that had been taken for us to get to the end of the transition.\n\nThat was necessary because there had been too much foot dragging; unfortunately this was not done. Because we met on March 19 and as we were getting to the end of March, this was still not being done. And then, again, Ayiri summoned the family together and unilaterally decided to disqualify the person who was presented. On what ground if you ask him, he will keep saying \u2018edict, edict edict.\u2019 And when you ask him, what in the \u2018edict\u2019 must be met that is not being met, he cannot tell you other than the fact that Ologbotsere has played one role or the other. But forgetting the Ologbotsere is not a unilateral figure. He is only first among equals; he is only chairman of the group and in all our 541 years of monarchy, we have had 20 Olus who had come and gone; and we are in the process of getting the 21st Olu. In all of our history, Ayiri is only \u2018number four\u2019 Ologbotsere; that is to say a lot of the time, we have been carrying on without Ologbotsere; so without him, we can carry on. We, therefore, had to take that position as the Council of Chiefs, passed a \u2018vote of no confidence\u2019 in that group and reconstituted it. And from then, things started moving forward up till the glorious conclusion you saw on Saturday.\n\nGauging the mood of the Itsekiri Nation six days after the event, what are the feedback that you\u2019ve been receiving?\n\nLet me put it this way, because there\u2019s a sense of euphoria that you can derive from the coronation event itself. But you should step backwards to the time when the rest of us chiefs had to take charge and started moving things forward. Excitement has filled everywhere among our people; they were happy and relieved that finally, we are on course. This has been a continuous build-up. By the time we were taking the next step like confirming and concluding the screening process till determining the candidate, there were jubilations. An then, when the announcement was made for the gathering of National Congregation of Itsekiri People where the news would be made, the whole place was jammed and that was on the 15th of April this year. And by the time the Omoba then had to also go to Ijala for another rite, the place was also jammed. This has been the build-up and climax of which you saw on Saturday, 21st of August during the coronation. The ripples of this has reverberated everywhere; we\u2019ve had people calling from USA, UK Germany and other places. Some Itsekiris and those who are not Itsekiris but friends of Itsekiri have called congratulating us. The excitement has been very electric, but we do not want to be carried away with that because we know that expectations are high; when people rejoice this way, it is because of what they know will be coming ahead of us. The meeting we held today was at the instance of His Majesty to look at what\u2019s on ground, where are we going, and what do we need to do.\n\nIt is not just to perpetuate ourselves in pageantry, but it is in terms of our people and our land; their needs, how do we meet them, what do we do to help them? We cannot depend on government to do everything; there are things we can do for ourselves. After all, we were a kingdom long before there ever was Nigeria and we used to look after ourselves. And we also know that in these days, if you cannot help yourself, you don\u2019t expect government to help you. Unfortunately, we also don\u2019t rely on politicians because when they get there, their songs are different from the time when they were campaigning for votes. When they get there after getting their votes, nothing tangible touches people on the ground.\n\nThose are the things we are engaging our attention right now and we are praying we will remain on course; we will not be dissuaded, lose our steam, lose our focus; we will not be diverted and like the king described it this afternoon, this is not a dash, it is a marathon. You don\u2019t expect the full result tomorrow or next week, but we want to be doing the right thing and moving at the right pace.\n\nWas the suspended Ologbotsere matter discuss at the meeting whether to bring him back or has he made any effort so far to reconcile and what is also going on about the missing crowns?\n\nThere are some things that ordinarily if they were well-handled, we wouldn\u2019t have needed to come to the public domain. This is really strictly our own internal business. However, it is unfortunate that he who is wrong, when he fails to be penitent, it becomes difficult even for you to take remedial reconciliating footsteps. That\u2019s what we have in our hands at the moment. Before the coronation, some people led him (Ologbotsere) and a few others to the then Omooba (Olu-designate) and the advice he gave to him personally was \u201cyou have offended the generality of the Itsekiri people. Because you can see the mood of anger, frustration and then the relief had come when remedial steps started to be taken. And people have been saying they don\u2019t want to see you anymore, you need to apologise to the nation. Write and publish an apology to say \u2018you\u2019re sorry,\u2019 the way you acted, you didn\u2019t know this was going to be the result. It has come out of your hands, out of your control and you need to be forgiven. When you do that, tension will come down.\u201d Next, just before the crown and the accessories were stolen, the Olu told him he\u2019s not accusing him of stealing the artifacts, but that he has a network of people he could talk to, to ensure that they were returned. \u201cDo these two things and people\u2019s tension will come down and they will be able to take another look at you.\u201d\n\nHe left the place, thankful at first, but later denied ever being told that. He said he was never told to do that. Even if you were never told to do that and if you have your own senses, should anybody teach you to do that? And if somebody has told you that, should you think about it twice? Worst still to deny ever being told and that was his position. What next did he do? He then went to court to challenge the process because he kept saying that unless he would say with his own mouth that the transition has happened, it has not happened. How can you say that to a people? A generality of whom do not joke with their Olu as an institution; if you touch their Olu, you touch their own core; they will fight you to the end. You know this, how dare you take this kind of stand? He went to court to try and stop the process and, of course, we know that going to court on a matter such as this, the court will also listen to facts and we were very confident that when the facts are laid down, there\u2019s no way he would get his way. And as we expected, the court could not stop the process.\n\nBut they had continued. The other prince, whom he was instigating, and who instigated and is suspected to be involved in the stealing of the crown, because he was here in the palace, when he got missing, the crown also got missing. You now dressed him up like Olu-designate and there was no way he was proclaimed to the nation as the Olu-designate, yet you dressed him up and put him on social media as the Olu-designate saying that you were going to use the missing crown to crown him on the 19th of August. How does this leave room for somebody to be easily forgiven and reconciled? It doesn\u2019t leave room at all. And the generality of people are even saying \u201cdon\u2019t ever bring him near,\u201d and that can be understandable. But if he were penitent, it would have been a different thing, altogether. But unfortunately, up till today, he doesn\u2019t sound penitent; he doesn\u2019t appear penitent; he is not taking any penitent move. Even God will not forgive one who refused to repent, you must repent before you\u2019re forgiven. He who fails to repent can never find forgiveness. I\u2019m praying for him that somehow, God will help him to have a penitent heart to see where he has gone wrong so that he will take the steps that will make people to forgive him.\n\nIsn\u2019t that act of stealing the crown and dressing up the wrong Olu-designate itself sacreligious and could attract penalties?\n\nDressing the prince as Olu-designate is sacrilegious; that\u2019s why we are praying for them. Because when you do this, the way that I put it, you offend Heaven, the Earth and the Nation. You see, That crown was made 1611 A.D, 410 years ago; and it has been in use since then. It was made with the cross of Jesus Christ on top of it. Those things that they have taken, they\u2019re all part of the order of Christ that is associated with the monarchy since then. That someone would have the effrontery to carry it away and intend to use it, we don\u2019t know how or where they\u2019ll handle the burden they are carrying and God will ask them. I know God will ask them that\u2019s why I pray for them that they should repent before it is too late.\n\nHas such sacrilege ever happened before in the history of the kingdom?\n\nNo! Such incident has never been recorded in history. The crown has never gone missing since it was made 410 years ago. In fact, nobody dared touch it except the king himself or the one who is crowning him and that is the only time he can touch it after that, he can\u2019t touch it, again. It\u2019s only the king that can touch it because it is sacred. And for someone to think that this is something he could toy with, what kind of a person is he? What sense of traditional value does he have?\n\nQUESTION: If the missing crowns and other artifacts were to be found and brought back to the palace, will it take some ritual sacrifice to get them restored in their prestine state spiritually?\n\nANSWER: It\u2019s value is not lost so it is not a question of doing something to restore the value. But those who are not supposed to have access to it and to handle it, have a burden; the burden is on them. How they will divest themselves off that, only God knows. And then something that the king said at his first speech on the throne on Saturday; he said what some people had done sacrilegiously, somehow there\u2019s some good from it. Because the first six Olus were crowned with Coral Beads, but from the 17th to the 20th Olu, 16 of them \u2013 were crowned with silver crown. However, this opportunity has made the 21st Olu to be crowned with a golden crown.\n\nQUESTIONS: What\u2019s the symbolic significance attached to this golden crown?\n\nANSWER: The symbolism of it is continue progression. They had thought that they would withhold the progression of the advancement of the Warri Kingdom, but the way things have turned out, it is a progression. In my lifetime, this is the first coronation I have watched; there\u2019s none as glorious as this one!\n\nI have witnessed three, there\u2019s none to be compared to this. CNN has expressed positive opinion about it; even Clarence House, which is the official abode of Prince Charles, in America, the President, they\u2019ve all turned and looked because of the Olu\u2019s address. We didn\u2019t ask for it to be so, but it was so.\n\nQUESTION: Given the king\u2019s young age, do you think he will be able to walk, talk?\n\nI don\u2019t know why you said given his age, because to some extent, his age is an added advantage. So, it shouldn\u2019t be seen as a minus but as a plus. You know, good managers don\u2019t do everything, but they get things done through people. When you recognize the talents that are there to be harnessed, you drive it , encourage it, , and things get done. He doesn\u2019t see himself as a lone ranger; he sees himself as being in the midst of talents that are available and he also sees the opportunity which are down and are around us, he sees the capacity that can be harnessed to bring together so that good can come out of it. That\u2019s what it takes.\n\nThere are criticisms against the maiden speech of the Olu, particularly his Christian worship songs intro which he rendered on an African traditional religious stool; what\u2019s your take on this?\n\nI think that whoever takes that position needs a lot, lot, lot more to learn about life and living and therefore tradition and customs practices. This is why I said so:\n\nThere\u2019s someone who has said years ago that because God created man in His image, there\u2019s something of God that is in everybody; and of course I recognize that from the the Bible as well. That is why some of his practices, you can see semblance of God and Godliness in it. It is also in his culture. But because since from Adam and Eve man has fallen into sin, disobedience against God, there are also other things that come into man in the sense of value that are ungodly. So, you have a mixture of this. Take any human group anywhere and this is what you will find. But for those who are touched by God, and who the before know Him more than the ordinary, they would also identify certain things in cultures that are Godly and promote them. Then, you will also find certain things that are not Godly and you know that it will be better for you to drop those things.\n\nDid you know, for instance, that where I come from they (the Itsekiri people) practised female circumcision? It used to be so. Do you know how long ago it was stopped? Over 400 years ago by an Olu who was a Christian; who said that was out of tune with God\u2019s creation. That it was violence against women and he stopped it. So, many people didn\u2019t know, but all those nationalities who are around us are still struggling to stop it today; but we stopped it long ago.\n\nThere are many things in our culture and tradition that are Christian based; because we were exposed to Christianity long ago. And by the way, Christianity is not a Western religion. It is a worldwide, global religion; because the whole world is for Christ. So, any tradition that will, as it were, see itself as against God is against itself. But a tradition that recognizes the Lord God Almighty and gives due honour to Him is on the way to redemption. Tradition by our own recognition and definition is not put against Godliness; tradition is bringing God to bare upon your tradition, uphold by your tradition the things that God will approve of. So God is therefore in every tradition.\n\nThe first five Olus were not Christians and, of course, they brought in practices which included certain things that are not Christian. But there are also some things that are Christian. In fact, since from the 6th Olu, the 6th Olu was a Christian and it was his son, when he was a crown Prince, who made the crown with the cross in 1611 and he became crowned in 1625. That was the first time they used that crown; his father was not crowned with that crown though he was a Christian.\n\nThere are practices that people will import and do whatever they like and also, as we understand Christainity, God does not force anybody to yield to Him. He will show you his ways and tell you this is the better way to go; if you go, the blessings that are in there, you inherit, but if you refuse to, even though God has warned and you chose another way, He won\u2019t strike down with a hammer; he will leave you to do what you want to. So, there are individuals who have brought different kinds of things into the system. In all of the period we had Christian Olus, there were also some that were mixing it up with all kinds of things that were not really pure. Whatever method that we use to praise God today is not alien to our tradition.\n\nSir, I recall that about a year before the demise of Atuwatse II in 2015, there were protests around the palace over the title \u2018Ogiame.\u2019 We were told the Olu wanted to drop the title \u2018Ogiame\u2019 because of it\u2019s perceived occultic connotations\u2026 What was the true account?\n\nI would not want to comment in details because I was also there. My understanding and which the king actually told everybody based on which those who were tensed up, was that what he was trying to do they did not understand. When God created man, He gave man dominion over all His creation. And Jesus having come, died and resurrected and seated on the right hand of God in heaven and all believers are seated there with Him and that all principalities and powers are under His feet. And by our traditional beliefs and custom, no juju can overtake the Olu. All jujus are under the feet of the Olu and every Itsekiri man and woman knows this. All jujus bow to the Olu. And if for some reason one juju arrests an individual, the Olu can declare such a person loosed and he\u2019ll be loosed and the juju will give way. What he was trying to say then was the misunderstanding, the misinterpretation as if he\u2019s the one to serve the god of the sea, No! But this is what they did not understand. To Ogiame, it means he\u2019s king over the waters, yes God has made us kings over things under the waters whether physical or spiritual. The context in which you accept things matters a lot because that\u2019s the meaning it conveys to you and that\u2019s the meaning that determines your response.\n\nWas that what probably informed his son using his authority as it were to reverse the curse his late grandfather, Olu Erejuwa II placed on the land?\n\nExactly. He has the authority to do so. So, when you call Ogiame, you\u2019re not implying that there\u2019s a bigger juju than him, somewhere.\n\nYou spoke about an Olu that halted the tradition of female circumcision. Are there remaining practices among the Itsekiris that this present Olu may also need to abolish in due time?\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet, but even the way we dress, our full regalia as chiefs, we look like Catholic Cardinals is because of how it derived from Christian culture. Even the way we conduct ancestral worship, which we call \u2018Ebora,\u2019 it is a corruption of the Holy Communion. So, there are many such things that we\u2019ve taken from our Christian background some centuries ago some of which have been distorted, taken out of contest, given a different meaning, but when you get to the Scriptures, you\u2019ll get the proper meaning and align yourself with them.\n\nPhoto of former President Olusegun Obasanjo kneeling before the Olu is still doing the round across the globe. What reactions have the palace got from the gesture?\n\nThe reaction was positive. We\u2019re deeply touched because for one thing he\u2019s not an Itsekiri man but he knows the tradition, he knows the level of that throne. He did that to the institution of the Olu of Warri. And we deeply appreciate him for that.\n\nWhat effect will that have on the entire Itsekiri Nation, I mean what\u2019s the significance?\n\nLike I said, the people were touched deeply. Because for some to do such, even though he didn\u2019t have to, someone who was an ex-president but he did it voluntarily. It\u2019s a positive for him, too as more people will respect him.\n\nWhat\u2019s the role of divine predestination in the enthronement of the current Olu?\n\nYes there are many things which confirmed that to us. There were prophecies that had come before now. And in the course of the process, you could see the hand of God in it for any discerning person.\n\nSuspended Ologbotsere, Ayirimi Emami, once said the current Olu was rejected by the Oracle in 2015, giving that as one of his grouses?\n\nYou see Ayirimi was not telling you what he knew because he was in no position to know what actually transpired. I was in the Olu Advisory Council as of then and he wasn\u2019t. The new Olu was never presented to us as a candidate at all let alone rejecting him. How would you reject somebody who has not been rejected? It is the final candidate the ruling house brings to the chiefs that we work on. And if the chiefs have a reason to reject any candidate, it will objectively done in the clear view of everyone. He was never brought to the fore in 2015 neither was he rejected. We don\u2019t interfere how the family brings up its candidate. The family never brought him then and as chiefs we have no right to ask for any particular candidate to be brought forward.\n\nThis so-called edict aspect of an Olu-designate\u2019s mother must be Itsekiri nor Edo, has it not been distorted and may boomerang in the future by the coming of the present Olu?\n\nDo you know who wrote that? Do you know if it was an edict or a declaration? What\u2019s is written there black and white is \u201cwhose mother is Itsekiri or Edo (not Benin) origin. Do you know any Itsekiri person who knows the story of Itsekiri and will tell you that no iota or trace of Yoruba in Itsekiri origin? None! Those who formed the Itsekiri nationalities include Yoruba groups, Nupe groups, Igala groups, former Dahomey groups, they all came at different times. But when they came, the base they met was first, Yoruba group and they started developing the language which is why you have the difference between Yoruba language and Itsekiri language. Of all the languages in the whole world, the nearest to us is Yoruba. It\u2019s because Yoruba is at the base of the Itsekiri language and nationality. By the time Benin came, the language had already been developed fully which is why in the main body of the Itsekiri language you don\u2019t find Benin in it. It\u2019s only in chieftaincy affairs and royal where you have Edo language and terminologies because the institution was brought from there. And when they came they didn\u2019t come to replicate Edo, the Yoruba group that came didn\u2019t come to replicate Yoruba, just like others. They all came and were assimilated into Itsekiri. And when you talk of Edo origin, you cannot also shove away Yoruba from it.\n\nSo those who wrote it could be considered a superflous since Yoruba is inherent in Itsekiri and also Edo. Why should that be a problem? This thing was first written in 1931 when we were in the process of having the 17th Olu ahead of 1936 and the colonial government needed to have something written down in their name. Every Itsekiri person who knows his worth knows that you cannot isolate Itsekiri from Yoruba and therefore should never be a problem. Why wasn\u2019t it a problem in 1936, 1952, 1987, so why now? It is because people who are mischievous in content and intent wanted to nit-pick that. That\u2019s what happened. It\u2019s a non-issue.\n\nSir, would then say that, from every indication, Ogiame Atuwase III ascension to the throne was God-ordained?\n\nYes! You know, there were many things which confirmed that to us. There were propheies that have come before now. Then, in the course of the process, you could also clearly see the hand of God. Fir any discerning person, you could see clearly that the hand of God is in this!\n\nSir, Chief Ayiri Emami has been hammering on the fact that the present Olu was rejected by the Oracle in 2015. What is then your take on that?\n\nYou see, Ayiri was not telling you what he knew. Because, he was not positioned to know that. I was a member of the Olu Advisory Council as at then, he(Ayiri) was not . And he (Olu) was never presented to us by his family at all. If somebody has not been presented,how would you have rejected the person? He was never! You see, look, can I say this to you? The family had a duty to go through their own internal process. It is the person that the family projects and brings to the chiefs ,that the chiefs will now process. It is only if the chiefs have reason(s) yo disqualify that individual that it would to us not be subjective.\n\nIt would be in the full view of others, including the view of those who bright him. It would be clear to all that the person has been rejected. All the chiefs need do is, you see now , it is not taken . So, go bring somebody else. That never happened in 2015. So, him saying that ; he manufactured that from his head because it never happened that way. Now within the family, they may have whatever way they went about it. We didn\u2019t want to interfere. Whether some of us liked it or not, we had to abide by it. That was what happened. They never brought him(Olu) the first time . As chiefs , we had no duty , no privilege, we have no responsibility to demand that they bring a particular person or particular person be presented. So, we couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n...",

          "text": "Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom has berated a former governor of the state and Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume for asking him to apologise to President Muhammadu Buhari over his recent comment that the President was involved in an alleged plan to \u2018Fulanise\u2019 Nigeria.\n\nAkume had also while attacking Ortom over his criticism of President Buhari, called on anti-graft agencies to \u201cthoroughly investigate\u201d him for using foul language against the president.\n\nBut responding to the former governor in a statement on Tuesday, Ortom in turn asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe Akume\u2019s administration in Benue from 1999 when he became governor, alleging that N2 billion that went missing at the twilight of his administration had yet to be accounted for.\n\nIn a statement signed by his media aide, Terver Akase on Monday, Ortom mocked Akume, saying he was only interested in what he would gain from the President.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cAs expected, Senator Akume and his group avoided responding to the issues of insecurity in the country which the Governor has repeatedly and rightly accused the Presidency of complicity.\n\n\u201cThe outing of George Akume and others in Abuja was nothing more than a massage on the ego of the Presidency to curry personal favours. As long as he and his group secure their meal tickets, Benue can go to hell. A media attack on Governor Ortom instantly attracts a package from the Villa.\n\n\u201cAkume and his group must have been under immense pressure to hold the press conference and hurl vituperation against the Governor. This, they had to do to keep their jobs.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue, having lost grip of the party membership in the state with hundreds defecting to PDP (Peoples Democratic Party) every week, now see a window of opportunity to relaunch themselves into relevance. As a two-term former Governor of Benue State, it is shocking that Akume is now calling for the declaration of state of emergency in the state to dismantle democratic structures.\n\n\u201cIs it not contradictory that Akume faults Governor Ortom over his statements on the President\u2019s handling of the security situation in the country but goes ahead to brand the Governor as a criminal and sponsor of militia? We challenge the Minister to provide evidence to back his claim that the Governor is involved in corruption and sponsors militia.\n\n\u201cWe recall that when he was Governor, Akume challenged the then President Chief Olusegun Obasanjo for not doing enough to end the Jukun/Tiv crisis on the border of Benue and Taraba State. He is on record to have confronted President Obasanjo and said uncomplimentary things to the President. Now he finds it convenient to give lectures on respect for hierarchy in government and age.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn his call for a probe, we have no objection to that. Governor Ortom is running a transparent administration and has nothing to hide. We however invite Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to begin their probe from 1999 when Akume became Governor. The N2 billion that went missing at the twilight of his administration is yet to be accounted for.\n\n\u201cAkume\u2019s utterances in 2019 are still fresh in the minds of Benue people. After the state came under herdsmen attacks and hundreds were killed, he accused Benue people of killing themselves. That the people responded to him by voting him out of the Senate confirmed their anger towards him.\n\n\u201cLastly, we expected APC to hold the press conference in Benue to test their popularity among the people of the state.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria has recorded one additional death from Covid-19, even as 460 people tasted positive for the virus across 12 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Monday.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), in an update shared on its Facebook page late Monday night, said the country\u2019s fatality toll from the disease now stands at 2,455.\n\nIt further noted that the latest figure of confirmed cases has increased Nigeria\u2019s infection toll to 191,805 among which the active cases are 10,858.\n\nThe NCDC data showed that Rivers State reported the highest figure of 164 cases while Lagos State came second on the log with 139 infections. Edo State recorded 61 to rank third.\n\nThe FCT ranks fourth with 37 cases, while Bayelsa State recorded 20 cases to take the fifth slot, followed by Oyo State with 14 cases, Plateau State, seven while Ogun State recorded six cases.\n\nAnambra and Benue states reported four cases each, followed by Enugu State with two cases, while Cross River and Kaduna states recorded one case each.\n\nVaccination Crisis in Edo\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of civil societies in Edo State on Monday, staged a protest over the state\u2019s policy on mandatory vaccination for residents.\n\nThe state governor, Governor Godwin Obaseki had said residents without proof of COVID-19 vaccination would be barred from public facilities and large gatherings.\n\nHe made this known during the flag-off of the second phase of COVID-19 vaccination in Benin, the state capital, where he lamented the increasing cases of infections in the state.\n\nMr Obaseki had said from September 15, anyone who had yet to take the vaccine would not be allowed into public places, such as banks and worship centres.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen so far, COVID-19 pandemic is here to stay. This is the third wave and there is nothing that points to the fact that other waves will not come. What we are likely to see is intermittent waves of this pandemic. We are not going to shut down Edo State but we will make sure we protect all Edo citizens.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I have come out with the following regulations, beginning from the second week of September 2021, large gatherings as well as high traffic public and private places will only be accessed by persons who have proof of taking at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d the governor had said.\n\nSimilarly, in a memo dated August 30, with reference number HA.429/1/16, the permanent secretary of the state\u2019s health ministry, Frederick Irabor, said officials of the ministry were given a seven-day ultimatum to get vaccinated against the pandemic.",

And some Catholics are still attacking the worship of Blessed Sacrament through adoration; what are they going there to do? The country is sinking just as I told them last time. The arrest of Nnamdi Kanu; will it solve any problem? Will it stop any agitation? Now, the attack on the NDA; is it Nnamdi Kanu now?\n\n\u201cIs it not better he is released. Since he is still under their custody and NDA could be perforated, violated and mesmerised, what is the hope of this country if it can happen in Nigeria Defence Academy? Where else is safe?\n\n\u201cAs I told you people last two months that what you are seeing is just the beginning of the trouble and that the main trouble is coming. This one that they did (NDA attack) is just the elementary part of it. The secondary part of it is still coming.\n\n\u201cI am only asking God to intervene because what is happening in Afghanistan right now; if God is not ready to help us, Nigeria\u2019s situation will be worse in the future. You are free to attack Father Mbaka and criticize me, that one is your problem.\n\n\u201cI am doing my prophetic work, and I don\u2019t need apology or affirmation or support or approval from anybody apart from the Holy Spirit who sent me on this risky assignment.

          "text": "By Taiye Agbaje\n\nMr Kehinde Ibiteye said he risked his life to deliver N2.5 million ransom to kidnappers of his brother-in-law, Mr. Kayode Ajayi, and his son, Olawale, in a forest in the Bwari area of the FCT.\n\nIbiteye made this known while giving a special thanksgiving to God for his safe return during a service at the Word of Life Area of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in Kubwa, Abuja.\n\nThe RCCG member said his aunt\u2019s husband, together with his son, was kidnapped at Ungwan-Fulani, a suburb in Bwari where they live at the wee hour of Aug. 23.\n\n\u201cI got a phone call from a member of my family that my aunt\u2019s husband and his 19-year-old son have been kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThey were kidnapped, not on the road, but right in their house. The gunmen, numbering about 25, broke into the house and took them away.\n\n\u201cThey first broke into a neighbour\u2019s residence but nobody was seen in the house.\n\n\u201cWhen they couldn\u2019t find anyone, they went to my aunt\u2019s house, forcefully made their way into the house, collected monies to the tune of N20,000, two android phones, took along with the food items and abducted the father and son.\n\n\u201cI immediately called his wife who cried as she confirmed the ugly experience.\n\n\u201cThey were kidnapped last week Monday between the hours of 12 am and 1am,\u201d he narrated.\n\nIbiteye said her aunt informed that the police in the area came few minutes after the abduction but to no avail.\n\n\u201cAnd since I speak Hausa fluently and no other person could communicate in the language, I engaged their abductors in telephone conversations through my aunt\u2019s mobile phone which they called with.\n\n\u201cAt first, they placed N15 million bounty on their heads if we want them released,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said after he negotiated further, they lowered the ransom to N2.5 million.\n\nAccording to him, the police did little or nothing to get the victims rescued.\n\n\u201cThe police only called to warn that we shouldn\u2019t take money to the terrorists; we shouldn\u2019t be the one to be in charge.\n\n\u201cGenerally, they have a lackadaisical approach to the whole thing; they weren\u2019t forthcoming. I didn\u2019t even take them seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said after the money was raised, their abductors instructed that the money should be taken to a hilly forest after a village called Kuchikwo in Bwari.\n\nIbiteye lamented that the biggest challenge for the family was, however, who to take the money to the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cI finally resolved to take the N2.5 million to them in the forest. I took a risk giving that my blood relatives were involved.\n\n\u201cI decided not to inform my wife and children about my resolution.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I did was to pray to God. I told God to protect me, guide me and see me through the adventure.\n\n\u201cI also told God that as I go to the forest, I would come back with my aunt\u2019s husband and his son unhurt.\n\n\u201cI developed a strong faith, believing that God would not disappoint me\n\n\u201cAnd when I was conversing with the abductors, I tried to build their confidence on the fact that the money we agreed on finally would definitely get to them so long they could guarantee the safety of the captives.\n\n\u201cAt times if I talked with them, I would be hearing how my in-law and his son were being tortured,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the kidnappers warned us against inviting the police.\n\n\u201cThey warned that if we informed the police, they would know and we would pay dearly for it,\u201d Ibiteye said.\n\nHe said the captors gave him instructions at intervals.\n\n\u201cI was told to get an Okada rider (a commercial motorcyclist) who is well familiar with the environment to convey me to their enclave.\n\n\u201cI picked an okada randomly at about 3p.m. on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAlthough he initially declined to go on the journey, after so much pressure from people who know him, he agreed to convey me to the forest.\n\n\u201cHe said he would collect N10, 000 as transport fare.\n\n\u201cWhen I spoke with the captors, they ordered me to give the phone to the bike man and they directed us to leave for the forest around 5 pm.\n\n\u201cWe traveled for about one and half hours before getting to a marketplace where we were directed to pull up.\n\n\u201cAt this time, it was getting dark and cloudy. They did this to allow the nightfall before getting to their area.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, they directed us to continue the journey.\n\n\u201cAt about 8pm that day, we got to the hinterland of the forest, surrounded by hills and mountains.\n\n\u201cThe forest is two villages after Kuchikwo, and throughout our journey from there, it was raining heavily,\u201d he said.\n\nIbiteye said a man, hanging AK-47 on his shoulder, came out from their camp, flashed light at them and ordered him to place the money on the rocky ground.\n\n\u201cHe asked if the money was complete and I responded in affirmation.\n\n\u201cWe were then told to go back to the marketplace at the village where we had a stopover on our way going to the forest.\n\n\u201cThey said there, my in-law would reunite with us,\u201d he said.\n\nIbiteye, who said it was at the market area the abductees came out from a bush, said the four of them rode on the motorcycle back home.\n\n\u201cThough the market was not operating at the time, I became curious if anybody passes by until I saw my in-law and his son coming out from a nearby bush,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said immediately they got to Bwari, his in-law and his son were taken to hospital because of the wounds sustained from the torture and various inhuman treatments subjected to while in captivity.\n\nIbiteye said based on the victims\u2019 account, the kidnappers had various sophisticated weapons in their camp.\n\n\u201cThey also observed that those guys (abductors) were working as syndicate because they conversed with some other people either within or outside Abuja on the phone.\n\n\u201cBesides, my in-law told me that when the police team came around the day they were kidnapped shooting sporadically in the air, all of them together with their captors were still within the surroundings.\n\n\u201cIt was after the police team left that they began to embark on the journey to the forest,\u201d he said.\n\nIbiteye described his experience as \u201chorrible and risky.\u201d\n\nThe RCCG member, who hinted that the incident was the third kidnap case in the area, called on the Federal Government to intervene.\n\n\u201cI believe the government is aware of the operations of these criminals and they should be sincere in fulfilling their mandate of ensuring the safety of lives and property of the citizenry,\u201d he urged.\n\nHowever, when NAN sought the confirmation of the incident in a phone call put across to the Police Public Relations Officer, FCT Command, Mariam Yusuf on Monday, she requested a text message after listening to the subject matter.\n\nHowever, she neither responded to the text message sent to her phone nor answered subsequent calls put across to her as at the time of filing the report.",

          "text": "Residents of Sapele, Sapele Local Government Area, Delta State, are tense after a brutal battle between Hausa traders and Fulani herders in the area on Monday at the famed Hausa Market along the Benin-Warri road, Amukpe, in the city.\n\nAccording to witnesses, ten people were injured in the ensuing chaos and were brought to several hospitals in the region with various degrees of injuries.\n\nThe clash also wrecked some wooden businesses at the market, causing a large traffic jam, with many motorists hurriedly parking their vehicles along the wayside and fleeing for safety.\n\nAccording to reports, the two warring factions began a supremacy struggle on Sunday night after a Hausa kid from one of the Northern states was allegedly stabbed in the bush by a Fulani herder and rushed home with injuries.\n\nThe Hausas in the market, particularly those of Nasarawa descent, were claimed to have rushed to mobilize and assault the Fulani herdsmen communities in the woods, enraged by the stabbing.\n\nThe Fulanis, on the other hand, are said to have fought back, apparently with lethal weapons, resulting in a conflict that sent even civilians fleeing for their lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Sapele Police Station operatives, commanded by CSP Harrison Nwaboisi, have entered the fray by deploying security to crucial places in order to defuse tensions and avert more damage.\n\nIbrahim Umoru, a vendor at the market, told media that the conflict erupted after a Hausa youngster was stabbed by a Fulani man because he was supposedly located near their tent.\n\n\u201cMaybe he (Fulani man) thought the boy came to steal from them. He did not ask why he (the boy) was there. The matter came to us this morning and we can\u2019t just sit there and watch them attack us every time. We want to tell them that we are not fools,\u201d the Hausa trader stated.\n\nOn the condition of anonymity, a Fulani herdsman blamed the Hausas for the brawl, but offered no other details.\n\nAs of the time of reporting this story, DSP Edafe Bright, the acting Police Public Relations Officer, could not be reached for comment on the event.",

People who have not yet been vaccinated at all will depend on remote access to these gatherings.\n\n\u201cFrom the second week of September people may not be allowed to worship in churches and mosques without showing proof of their vaccination cards at the gates,\u201d the governor had said.\n\nSpeaking on the deaths occasioned by non-vaccination, the team leader, Dr Osagie said there was need for the people to ensure compliance with all COVID-19 protocols.\n\nHe decried community transmission of the virus and urged the people to adhere to the COVID-19 protocols of wearing face mask, washing of hands and use of sanitizer amongst others.\n\n\u201cThe deaths recorded so far are unvaccinated persons. If they had been vaccinated they may have survived.\n\n\u201cWe have collected 1,624 samples in this third wave, out of which 228 are positive cases, 19 recoveries and seven deaths representing 15. 9 percent.\n\n\u201cWe have Modenna and Astrazenecca vaccines for residents. The measure taken by government was to ensure safety of the people,\u201d he stated.\n\nJournalist dies in C/River\n\nIn a related development, the first Cross River state journalist to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, Edem Edem of Daily Post, has died.\n\nHis wife, Mammy Edem, confirmed that her husband died, Wednesday, August 18, 2021.\n\nThe 60-year-old Edem hailed from Eto-Mkpe (Inameti Yellow Duke House) in Akpabuyo local government area of the state.\n\nHe had gone for the COVID-19 AstraZenneca vaccine March this year shortly after being discharged from the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH) where he spent few weeks for an undisclosed ailment.\n\nSpeaking while taking the jab, Edem had said \u201cI became the first frontline journalist to take the vaccine in Calabar and there is nothing to be afraid of \u2013 people should come out and take the vaccine to become immunized.\n\n\u201cAs a journalist, I am a frontline worker. I pursue stories about people infected with COVID-19 who are in quarantine centres, hospitals and other areas of confinement \u2013 hoping and praying that I don\u2019t contract it myself.\u201d\n\nHowever, the journalist, who had put in more than 25 years in the profession became very ill again two months ago and was rushed to the UCTH for the second time over what was, this time, suspected to be kidney-related.\n\nBut this time around, his condition could not be managed even as the immediate cause of his death could not be ascertained as at press time.\n\nA cross section of those who spoke to Blueprint bemoaned Edem\u2019s departure.\n\nWhile many believed he may have died of kidney problem, others feared the vaccines may have contributed in worsening his existing health challenges.\n\nEdem was the Financial Secretary of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Cross River state Council.\n\nKano\n\nMeanwhile, the Kano state Ministry of Education has extended the resumption date for all public/private primary and secondary schools in the state by one week.\n\nCommissioner for Education Malam Muhammad Sanusi Sa\u2019id Kiru said the one-week extension was aimed at normalising the state\u2019s academic calendar after series of disruptions resulting from the effect of the COVID- 19 pandemic.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued Monday by the ministry\u2019s spokesperson, Malam Aliyu Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAll students of boarding schools are to resume on Sunday, the 12th of September, 2021 as against 5th September, while the Day Schools students are to resume on Monday, 13th of September, 2021 as against 6th September earlier announced,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe commissioner expressed appreciation to parents/guardians for the support accorded the ministry, hoping that the tempo would be sustained.\n\nThe statement urged parents and guardians to ensure their wards resume school at the stipulated dates.",

          "text": "\u2026Says they\u2019re dismayed in Ortoms crass incompetence\n\n\u200b\u200bStakeholders of the Benue State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC , have urged the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency in the state, adding that they are dismayed by this crass incompetence exhibited by the governor and his lonesome bitter and sustained campaign of calumny on the person and office of President, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nLeader of the Benue APC and Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Sen. George Akume made these calls at a press conference in Abuja on Monday, noting that the call was hinged on the fact that Governor Samuel Ortom had lost control of the security situation in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are dismayed by this crass incompetence exhibited by the governor. Governor Ortom is clueless, his gangsterist and foul language to disparage decent people could further deteriorate the security situation in Benue State. We urge security agencies to immediately arrest all criminal elements Governor Ortom is using to perpetuate insecurity and bring normalcy to the troubled state.\n\nHowever, the party leaders condemned what it described as the governor\u2019s \u201cpenchant for verbally attacking\u201d President Muhammadu Buhari without regard for his age and office.\n\nThe Minister lamented that there is a high level of proliferation of small arms and light weapons in Benue State, praying the federal government to thoroughly comb the State to recover those arms. \u201cSince Governor Ortom has consistently alleged that the security situation in Benue State has deteriorated in such a manner that lives of Benue people are not secured, we call on Mr. President as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces to declare a state of emergency in Benue State to bring the security situation in the state under control. \u201cLet me use this opportunity to commend President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for his resilience and steadfastness in driving the development agenda of his administration nationally and especially in Benue State. \u201cThe men and women of good conscience in Benue State are in full support of his administration and stand to condemn the ethnic profiling propagated by Governor Samuel Ortom. We are better than that as a people. We, the APC elders/stakeholders in Benue State pledge our total and unflinching support to Mr. President and his administration. \u201cFinally, we hereby roundly condemn the senseless killings that have been going on in Benue State perpetrated by criminal groups, be they the Fulani herdsmen, militia groups and political mercenaries acting the scripts of so-called political leaders. Benue State should not be allowed to degenerate into a primitive and mindless killing field at a time other states are reaping bountiful dividends of democracy. \u201cOur hearts go out to all the families that have lost loved ones, some of whom are presently mourning their unburied dead relatives. We pray that the Almighty God should grant them the fortitude to pass through this trying times without losing hope in a one united and indivisible nation. Akume demanded that the Governor should render account of the arbitrary N800 million monthly allocations he appropriates to himself as security votes as well as the over N200 million monthly deductions he makes from the Local Government Joint Account in the pretext of catering for the IDP camps, and yet he funds no solution to the insecurity and IDP camps situation. The Minister also demanded true accountability for the billions of Naira released to Benue broad funds and invited the EFCC to step into the matter and help the Benue people in the evil extortion.\n\nAccording to the former Benue State Governor, \u201cthe President has delivered all his obligations to the Governor and people of Benue State by ensuring regular and prompt releases of state\u2019s and local government\u2019s monthly federal allocations, all which amount to about Five Hundred Billion Naira (N500 billion) since Ortom\u2019s assumption of office as Governor in 2015.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, President Buhari had released Forty Billion (N40 billion) Naira to the Ortom administration as bail out funds to enable him pay outstanding salaries, pensions and allowances, as well as another Twenty-Eight Billion Naira (N28 billion) released to Governor Ortom as refunds from the Paris Club refund, just as also, the President graciously sent an extra Ten Billion (N10 billion) to the Benue State Governor to enable him provide infrastructures for the people of Benue State.\n\nThe Federal Government should as a matter of urgency direct the disbandment of the Livestock Guards in Benue State for their involvement in nefarious and criminal activities leading to the breach of peace and massacre of innocent citizens of Benue State,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Stakeholders in Borno State have called for stringent profiling of repentant insurgents as many Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters surrender to troops in the North East.\n\nThe call was part of the 16 resolutions reached during a security multi-stakeholder town-hall meeting convened by Governor Babagana Zulum in Maiduguri, the state capital.\n\nGovernor Zulum\u2019s spokesman, Isa Gusau, in a statement on Monday explained that the meeting extensively discussed the pros, cons and implications of the ongoing surrender by repentant insurgents.\n\nAccording to him, all groups made frank presentations during the meeting held on Sunday afternoon before the resolutions were reached.\n\nThey stressed the need to properly profile the repentant insurgents to avoid the hasty release of hardened elements to the larger society.\n\nThe stakeholders also demanded that firearms be retrieved from all repentant insurgents, and urged the military to intensify the battle against ISWAP.\n\nThey want the Federal Government to quickly establish a world-class centre with facilities for de-radicalisation and rehabilitation of repentant insurgents to where they can be cautiously reintegrated after satisfactory rehabilitation.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Governor Zulum called on all participants to be very open and analytical in their submissions looking at potential advantages, problems and implications of having repentant insurgents in the society.\n\nHe stated that while it was difficult accepting the killers of their loved ones, it was equally important to find ways of ending the 12-year insurgency.\n\nThe governor described the surrendering of the insurgents as dealing with \u201ctwo extreme conditions\u201d.\n\nHe explained that accepting insurgents has its implications on one hand while rejecting them could swell the ranks of rival ISWAP faction that was still armed and waging war.\n\nGovernor Zulum referred to the case of Afghanistan where 20 years of the military fight ended with the Taliban now in control of the government.\n\nIn his submission, the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai Elkanemi, urged residents to consider genuine reconciliation in the interest of peace while leaders should preach forgiveness and tolerance in their respective domains as one of the ways forward.\n\nOthers who attended the meeting were federal lawmaker, Senator Ali Ndume; Theatre Commander of Operation Hadin Kai, Major General, Christopher Musa; Chief Imam of Borno, Zannah Laisu, a representative of the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Borno, and a victim of Boko Haram insurgency, Babagana Malum, among others.\n\nRead the communique released at the end of the meeting and signed by the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Borno, Kaka Lawan, below:\n\nThe stakeholders appreciated the untiring efforts and support of His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria towards ending Boko Haram insurgency and other criminalities in Borno State and the country at large.\n\nThe stakeholders commended the zeal and determination of His Excellency, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum, FNSE, mni, Executive Governor of Borno State towards the restoration of lasting peace in the State. The meeting further noted the unparalleled support rendered to the IDPs and vulnerable by His Excellency, the Executive Governor.\n\nThe stakeholders welcomed the effort of the Federal and State Governments in the provision of state-of-the-art equipment and other logistics to the security operatives that led to the renewed vigour in the fight against insurgents which resulted in the recent surrender.\n\nThe meeting urged the Federal and State Governments to handle the issues of repentant Boko Haram insurgents with utmost care and within the instrumentality of the law.\n\nThe meeting stressed the need for proper profiling of repentant Boko Haram insurgents to avoid hasty release of hardened elements to larger society.\n\nThe meeting welcomed the recent massive surrender by the Boko Haram insurgents and urged those still in the bush to follow suit.\n\nThe meeting called for all firearms and offensive weapons used by the repentant insurgents to be retrieved from them.\n\nThe meeting strongly advocated for the strengthening of the deradicalisation mechanism of Operation Safe Corridor so as to involve parents of the surrendered Boko Haram members, Ulamas, traditional/community leaders and the media.\n\nThe meeting urged citizens to key into the educational opportunities created by the state government, especially by enrolling their children and wards in schools as a counter-measure for indoctrination.\n\nThe stakeholders reiterated the need for further support to all victims of insurgency especially women and children.\n\nThe meeting called on the Federal Government to establish a world-class deradicalisation/rehabilitation centre in Borno State being the epicentre of insurgency.\n\nThe meeting called for a true reconciliation amongst the affected people.\n\nThe meeting appreciates the support of the Federal Government to the State, but solicited for more funding from the Federal Government to the State especially in areas of reconstruction, resettlement, reintegration, education and health as the meagre resources at the disposal of the state is not sufficient in view of the magnitude of the cost involved.\n\nThe meeting urged the military to sustain the ongoing offensive on the activities of ISWAP.\n\nThe meeting resolved to have a periodic briefing on the activities of the surrendered Boko Haram terrorists with a view to creating awareness amongst the public.\n\nThe meeting further resolved that the North East Development Commission (NEDC) as a matter of priority be involved in all aspects of the rehabilitation and integration of surrendered Boko Haram into mainstream society.",

          "text": "South African scientists have detected a new coronavirus variant with multiple mutations but are yet to establish whether it is more contagious or able to overcome the immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has said.\n\nThe variant, known as C.1.2, was flagged last week by the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation and Sequencing Platform in a preprint study that has yet to be peer-reviewed. NICD scientists said on Monday C.1.2 was only \u201cpresent at very low levels\u201d and that it was too early to predict how it might evolve.\n\nWhile the majority of South Africa\u2019s coronavirus cases are currently caused by the Delta variant \u2013 first detected in India \u2013 C.1.2 caught scientists\u2019 attention because its mutation is almost twice as fast as observed in other global variants.\n\nIts frequency remains relatively low, however, and it has so far been detected in less than 3 percent of genomes sequenced since it was first picked up in May \u2013 although this has increased from 0.2 percent to 2 percent last month.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, we do not have experimental data to confirm how it reacts in terms of sensitivity to antibodies,\u201d NICD researcher Penny Moore said during a virtual press briefing.\n\n\u201c[But] we have considerable confidence that the vaccines that are being rolled out in South Africa will continue to protect us against severe illness and death,\u201d she added.\n\nSo far C.1.2 has been detected in all nine provinces of South Africa, as well as in other parts of the world including China, Mauritius, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\nIt is however not frequent enough to qualify as a \u201cvariant of interest\u201d or a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d such as the highly transmissible Delta and Beta variants, which emerged in South Africa late last year.\n\nSouth Africa is the continent\u2019s hardest-hit country with more than 2.7 million COVID-19 cases reported to date, of which at least 81,830 have been fatal.\n\nThe Beta variant drove a second wave of infections in December and January, and the country is now grappling with a persistent third Delta-dominated wave predicted to overlap with a looming fourth.",

In the Olympics we got little pins that we were supposed to pass around to other players.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t there for a long time so I have a couple in my bag left over.
