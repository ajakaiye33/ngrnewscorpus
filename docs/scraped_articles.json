          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nA Consultant Psychiatrist at the Federal Neuropsychiatrist Hospital, Yaba, Dr. Dapo Adegbaju says the lifespan of patients diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia is about five years after diagnosis.\n\nAccording to Adegbaju, the prognosis for the health condition is poor because its symptoms progressively get worse.\n\nDementia with Lewy Bodies also known as Lewy Body Dementia is a type of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning, and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Dr. Adegbaju said Lewy bodies are plaques that are proteinous deposited in the areas of the brain that controls thinking, movement, and memory.\n\nAccording to him, Lewy Body Dementia is the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nDementia is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in cognitive function beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological aging. Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death among all diseases and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally\n\nAdegbaju said the cause of the disorder is mostly unknown \u201cbut there have been theories about genetics especially with the coding for the protein causing it but the disease is more common in males than females.\n\n\u201cThe prevalence of the disease in Nigeria is not known. Although the prevalence of all types of dementia is about 5 per cent.\n\n\u201cPeople with Lewy Body Dementia may have hallucinations, poor sleep, poor concentration, movement issues leading to falls most times, and poor memory.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist noted that Lewy Body Dementia is progressive and the symptoms worsen, causing depression, fractures, bleeding into the brain, anxiety, agitation, and restlessness\n\n\u201cDiagnosis is made by a psychiatrist who will notice a decline in cognitive abilities, memory, and movement. Magnetic Resonance Imaging may help but the definitive diagnosis is at autopsy.\n\n\u201cLewy Body Dementia has no cure but can be managed with physical and occupational therapies as well as medications. It can be prevented by managing all physical illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, lipid issues, engaging in regular exercise, sleeping well, staying mentally fit, and eating a balanced diet.\n\n\u201cIt is better prevented than treated,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to an online portal, Healthline, Lewy Body Dementia is a term that covers two conditions that have similar symptoms. One is dementia with Lewy bodies, and the other is Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of dementia, the first thing that comes to mind might be Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The two conditions differ in that Alzheimer\u2019s involves extreme memory problems, and Lewy Body Dementia is more likely to affect how you process information. In addition, Lewy Body Dementia causes physical symptoms such as tremor and muscle stiffness,\u201d it noted.\n\nIt added that there\u2019s no way to stop the progression of Lewy Body Dementia as it will continue to affect cognitive abilities and motor functions and require lifelong medical care.\n\n\u201cSome symptoms can be managed, but medications must be monitored and adjusted as needed.\n\n\u201cA person with LBD will need the assistance provided by family and professional caregivers.

This leaves thirteen states without bilateral support.\n\n\u201cAs a condition for our partners to release their own grants, the partners want Nigeria to be responsible for thirteen states namely Abia, Anambra, Borno, Edo, Ekiti, Ondo, Kogi, Imo, Lagos, Rivers, and the Federal Capital Territory. The fund is not just to purchase mosquito nets as widely purported but to purchase test kits among others.\n\n\u201cMalaria is endemic to Nigeria and therefore people are so used to it and trivialize this disease in Africa. We are the country with the highest-burden of malaria. Malaria counts for about 60 per cent of out-patient hospital visits.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this briefing is to correct wrong information arising from not knowing the circumstances around the facility. The Federal Ministry of Health will gladly provide details. The public is enjoined to note the following: It is part of a borrowing plan, stated under the multilateral source of funds to meet Nigeria\u2019s financial obligations.\n\n\u201cThe money is about a quarter (25%) of what our foreign partners provided for the Global Roll-Back-Malaria Partnership Plan of Work.\n\nPaying this money is a condition for Nigeria to get foreign support.\n\n\u201cThe facility is domiciled with, and expended from the Ministry of Finance, it is not at the Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cExpenditure follows strict World Bank rules and guidelines and is monitored by the Ministry of Finance and as well as by the World Bank. The facility is for 13 States over a 5 year period, with about 25% going to nets and 75% to testing, treatment and other malaria control measures.

          "text": "By Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\n\nThe Kaduna State Government has received briefings from security forces on Sunday\u2019s attack by armed bandits along the Kaduna-Abuja road.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police, Abdullahi Mudassiru, alongside the Garrison Commander, One Division Nigerian Army, Brigadier General UT Opune, and the representative of the State Director, Department of State Services, Mr Garba Shehu Shinkafi led other security agencies to the location at Kurmin Kare, Kachia LGA, where the bandits carried out the attack which left one person dead and an unspecified number kidnapped.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police also informed the Commissioner, Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, that 11 citizens were rescued while one person, Alhaji Muhammad Sagir Hamidu, Chairman and CEO of Famaks British School, lost his life.\n\nThe vehicle used by Alhaji Sagir Hamidu who was killed during the attack ,was recovered by the Police.\n\nOn measures taken by the security forces, the Commissioner of Police disclosed that more men and assets have been deployed to the route, adding that the efforts of the Police were being complemented by the Military.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police also highlighted the practice of driving against the flow of traffic as a major security threat, as it exposed travelers to the risk of ghastly accidents, and also created build-ups which could be exploited by bandits.\n\nThe Garrison Commander, One Division Nigerian Army, discussed measures being taken by the Military, and assured the Kaduna State Government of their commitment to the security of citizens and commuters along the route. He explained that joint security operations were currently in progress in the state\u2019s frontline areas.\n\nResponding, the Commissioner, Internal Security and Home Affairs stated that Government was following the developments closely, having received assurances of commitment from the Police and Military. The Commissioner reiterated the commitment of the Kaduna State Government by way of continued provision of logistics and support to security agencies. He described the attack as a setback, stating however that the Government of Kaduna State would not be deterred by this in its security efforts.\n\nThe Commissioner fielded questions from journalists on the shutdown of telecommunication services in frontline areas, explaining that difficult situations required difficult measures. He disclosed that successes were being recorded as a result of the shutdown, which could not be explored in detail due to the sensitivity of operations. He pleaded with citizens experiencing communication difficulties to bear with the temporary measures in view of overall security advantages.\n\nThe Acting Governor, Dr Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe, received the briefings and sent her deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the attack, as she prayed for the repose of their souls.",

          "text": "Our bones support us and allow us to move. They protect our brain, heart, and other organs from injury. Our bones also store minerals such as calcium and phosphorous, which keep our bones strong, and release them into the body when we needed.\n\nDid you know that women are 4 times more likely to develop osteoporosis than men?\n\nAs a Nigerian, if this is your first time reading about osteoporosis, it is a disease of the bones that causes bones to become weak and break easily. Osteoporosis affects mostly older women, but prevention starts when you are young. There are multiple reasons why women are more likely to get osteoporosis than men, such as women tend to have smaller, thinner bones than men.\n\nEstrogen, a hormone in women that protects bones, decreases sharply when women reach menopause, which can cause bone loss.\n\nHunched backs, back pain, and frailty used to be things older women had to accept before doctors knew anything more about osteoporosis. However, the disease is preventable with a few tweaks to your lifestyle. The behaviors that women develop in their childhood, their adolescence, and in their early adult years really play a significant role in the development of the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors Affecting Chances of Osteoporosis:\n\nThere are three major factors that affect your chance of experiencing osteoporosis:\n\nThe amount of bone you have when you reach menopause: The greater your bone density is to begin with, the lower your chance of developing osteoporosis. If you had low peak bone mass or other risk factors that caused you to lose bone, your chance of getting osteoporosis is greater. How fast you lose bone after you reach menopause: For some women, bone loss happens faster than for others. A woman can lose up to 20% of her bone density during the 5 to 7 years following menopause. If you lose bone quickly, you have a greater chance of developing osteoporosis. Expectant women: As a Nigerian woman, pregnant or breastfeeding, be sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D. These vitamins are good for you and for your baby\u2019s growing bones. If you don\u2019t get enough of these nutrients, your baby\u2019s calcium needs will be met by taking calcium from your bones.\n\nHere are some ways to reduce your chances of getting Osteoporosis\n\nGet enough calcium and vitamin D each day. Get active. Choose weight-bearing physical activities, like running or dancing to build and strengthen your bones. Issue #5678 Don\u2019t smoke. Smoking raises your risk for broken bones. If you drink alcohol, drink in moderation because studies show too much alcohol can harm your bones.\n\nIn Nigeria, more education on the importance of bone health and the burden of osteoporosis needs to be intensified among the general population to reduce the incidences especially among women.\n\nHow to maintain and improve your Bone Health: OSTEOCARE\u00ae\n\nSupplementation also goes a long way in improving and protecting bone health. Nigerians as well as entire Africa need to incorporate nutritional supplements in addition to their daily diets to improve their health outcomes. Bone health is important for us all. With Osteocare\u00ae, you get extra support for your entire family \u2013 a specially-formulated source of Calcium to help maintain normal bones combined with important co-factors including Vitamin D, Zinc and Magnesium. It\u2019s expert nutritional support that goes beyond your bones.\n\nOsteocare\u00ae:\n\nGluten free\n\nNo lactose\n\nNo preservatives\n\nNo salt or yeast\n\nSuitable for vegetarians\n\nNot tested on animals\n\nAvailable in reputable pharmacies nationwide\n\nSources:\n\n\u00b7 https://www.bones.nih.gov\n\n\u00b7 www.vitabiotics.com\n\n\u00b7 ng.dailyadvent.com\n\n#Osteocare #BoneHealth #Osteoporosis #Calcium #Magnesium #VitaminD #Zinc #Supplements #VitabioticsSupplements #Estrogen #preventive #protectbones #minerals #backpain #frailty #hunchedbacks",

Lai Mohammed made the government\u2019s position at a briefing in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s no longer news that the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry that investigated cases of police brutality as well as the incident of Oct. 20th, 2020, at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos has submitted its report.\n\n\u201d The submission happened while I was out of the country on national assignment.\n\n\u201d Unlike many commentators and analysts, we took our time to read and digest the report, and we are now well placed to respond.\n\n\u201d Without mincing words, let me say that never in the history of any Judicial Panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that are not supported by evidence.\n\n\u201cWhat is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of Oct.20th 2020.\n\n\u201d It is simply incredible that a Judicial Panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance. Instead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThat report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob.\n\n\u201d Gentlemen, we have read some critical analysis of the report by a courageous few. One commentator, a lawyer, said it raised more questions than answers.\n\n\u201d Another commentator, a journalist, called it a \u2018disgraceful report by a disgraceful panel\u2019, saying it reported allegations instead of investigating the allegations.\n\n\u201d Yet another wondered how a Judicial Panel could use the words \u2018massacre in context\u2019 and equate such to a massacre.\n\n\u201d All these and many more have raised valid questions on that report. We salute their courage and refusal to be cowed by the rampaging lynch mob that has been screaming blue murder since the report was released.\n\n\u201cWe do not intend to bore you by rehashing details of the discrepancies, innuendoes, inconsistencies and errors in that report. They are already in the public space.\u201d\n\nThe Minister highlighted some errors in the report.\n\nHe added: \u201d Let us, however, point out some key highlights of such discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc.i) \u2013 The report threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it.\n\n\u201cThe experts said, inter alia, in their testimony: \u201dThe Team, finds that from the medical data examined, including the timeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries sustained by the Victims, who were taken to medical facilities.\u201d\n\nAsked if he will resign, Mohammed dismissed it.\n\nHe said:\u201d There have been clamours for my resignation right from the day I took this office.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) governors, under the umbrella of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) have revealed that they would secure a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari to resolve sundry issues of zoning arrangements for both the national leadership of the party, the presidential ticket and ultimately the date for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nThis is as President Buhari has endorsed February 2022 as new date for the national convention.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nChairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Atiku Bagudu, who was not specific on the exact date for the convention in February, said the convention was shifted because Anambra, Zamfara and two other states, were yet to complete their congresses. The governors reached the agreement at the end of their meeting on Sunday night in Abuja. Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi and Chairman of the PGF, who briefed newsmen, said he did not know when the party\u2019s national convention would hold.\n\n\u201cWe agreed as a forum to seek an appointment to meet with President Buhari and discuss the on-coming national convention of the party.\n\n\u201cMind you, we are just one organ of the party, and since we are making suggestions to both the party and our leaders, I think it is not fair to preempt or disclose it before the meeting holds.\n\n\u201cWe hope to secure that appointment as quickly as possible. We are seeking the appointment as soon as possible, maybe in the next few days.\n\nThe PGF chairman said the forum would keep the public informed on its decision on zoning of elective offices after its meeting with President Buhari.\n\nHe, however, said that insinuations in some quarters that the governors\u2019 planned meeting with Buhari was to discourage him from assenting to the amended electoral bill should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cThat is not correct. I just told you what we are meeting the president for, it is to discuss the on-coming national convention of the party.\u2019\u2019\n\nBagudu said that the forum also discussed issues of good governance, development in the polity and other issues that were pertinent to the progress of the party and the country.\n\nHe said the forum passed a vote of confidence on the party\u2019s Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\n\u201cWe passed a vote of confidence on the caretaker committee that has done a wonderful job, chaired by Gov. Buni of Yobe and two other governors who are members of the committee.\u2019\u2019\n\nBagudu lauded the committee for successfully organising congresses for the party at the ward, local government and state levels.\n\nHe noted that the committee had been making efforts to carry every party member along, including those that were aggrieved or felt dissatisfied by the outcome of the congresses.\n\nThe governor said such individuals were invited and persuaded to support the party in the interest of all.\n\n\u201cSometimes, electoral processes are not without annoyance, but we are happy with the conduct of the caretaker committee,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe PGF chairman assured that the APC would not implode anytime soon as was being speculated in some quarters, adding that those expressing such fears were not representing reality.\n\nBagudu said the APC had brought into its fold three outstanding governors, the deputy governor of Anambra, members of the National Assembly and distinguished Nigerians from all walks of life.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking for Nigerians to join us so that we can unify and serve Nigerians. While other parties are sending people away, we are, in spite of our strength, inviting them to join us so that together we can reposition and keep the progressive agenda going,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the outcome of the November 6 Anambra governorship election, Bagudu said Nigeria had won and president Buhari had made a statement about that. Although the forum could not disclose its resolution on the outcome of the Anambra State governorship election, it, however, argued that conducting an election under such tensed security situation, should be enough celebration.\n\n\u201cThat an election took place in Anambra. I think Nigeria has won and the President had made a statement about that. We are equally proud of our security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe party candidates in all elections have the pride of place to determine their views about the outcome. But we are proud that under the APC, that an election that hitherto people thought will be impossible had taken place,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nGovernor Buni, who also spoke on the outcome of the meeting, said: \u201cThe Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum after their meeting, has suggested February to the party and the president has concurred so we are going ahead to plan for the convention in February.Nigerians should expect more unity and progress as a result of the forthcoming convention.\u201d\n\nOn insinuations that he might be delaying the convention to extend his tenure as the Caretaker Chairman of the APC, Buni said, \u201cAm I a jobless person who is always trying to extend his tenure; to do what? I have my primary responsibility as a Governor to go back to my state and carry out my primary responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhat I am here to do is ad-hoc and of course to reposition the party and that is exactly what we have been able to achieve.\u201d\n\nMeanwhie, the APC Rebirth Group/Concerned APC Stakeholders has disassociated itself from calls for the dissolution of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. The group in a statement described the call as an intemperate action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the considered opinion of the APC Rebirth Group that all party members must show respect and regard for offices and those who occupy them. While we believe that all groups and individuals within the party have the absolute right to express their grievances and even push for the needed reforms, just like we have done severally, we nonetheless believe that such actions must be in accordance with the rules and regulations of the party.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

While we reiterate our position on inclusion and the need to build a party that works for everyone, we call on all who feel strongly about the APC to exercise decorum, respect the rules of the party and not seek to engage in anti-social behaviours that violate the sanctity of the APC.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, yesterday, met with President Muhammadu Buhari, declaring the National Assembly has done its job by transmitting the recently passed Electoral Amendment Bill 2021 into law to him noting that the expeditions now was for him to sign into law.\n\nLawan, who briefed State House Correspondents after a meeting with the president, said he would not be stampeded into signing until he was properly advised by relevant ministers and aides.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, had, last Thursday, said the president was in support of direct primaries after they met at the Presidential Villa.\n\nMany governors across the two main parties- All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are against direct primaries and have urged the president not to sign the bill into law because of the clause that mandates political parties to conduct direct primaries in selecting candidates.\n\nAsked how the ruling APC can ensure stability when governors who are critical stakeholders are not happy with direct primaries as contained in the bill, Lawan said: \u201cWell, you see, sometimes, this kind of disagreements happen. And when they do, I think the best way forward is for people to engage. I always believe, and I\u2019ve conversed for this, that National Assembly members are major stakeholders, governors of APC are major stakeholders and in fact, the presidency is a major stakeholder, and the biggest stakeholder because it runs the administration, and our party must always try to bring everybody together.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be any day that you will have a political issue that everybody will say the same thing about it that agrees with you without any amendment.\n\n\u201cSo, when we have any section of a party disagreeing with something we should be engaging that\u2019s why we are politicians, we must have that kind of a platform where we discuss the issues, let\u2019s understand each other, and then we make whatever it is that will make this disagreement minimised. Or maybe were possible, eliminated completely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is right to say that governors have disagreed. Maybe some governor\u2019s might have said they don\u2019t like it this way. But that\u2019s normal. So, it\u2019s for us to engage and engage and engage.\u201d\n\nOn if the National Assembly was willing to let go of the direct primaries if need be, the Senate president said: \u201cThis is not something that we should be talking now because it has passed the legislature and it\u2019s no more with the legislature. So, this is something that is now with Mr. President, if we are talking about the electoral amendment bill, the National Assembly has finished its work. And the bill has been transmitted to Mr. President. And I think at this moment, all eyes will be on what happens to the bill from the executive side rather than the legislature.\n\n\u201cOf course, when we send a bill to Mr. President, we expect the bill to be signed. But there are two things that can happen. Mr. President could decide to of course, after consultation with his advisers, sign, or if he doesn\u2019t want to sign, he may have his reasons. But I believe whatever we do in the National Assembly, especially this Ninth National Assembly, we think deep, we think wide, we will consult very broadly before we take any position. So, I believe whatever we send to the executive arm of government, Mr. President for his assent, these are things that are well thought out.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that the expectation of members of National Assembly will be that this bill is signed. But this is then again, not my own calling, it is for Mr. President to take his decision.\u201d\n\nAsked what was the president\u2019s response, Lawan said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not supposed to tell you what he said. Because Mr. President has his spokespeople. So, I am neither Femi Adesina nor Garba Shehu. And my opinion is National Assembly has done its work. And members of National Assembly have expressed themselves. This is the majority view and is for Mr. President to look at it and of course, expectation of National Assembly is to get the presidential assent to it.\u201d.0]\n\nOn how long he thinks it will take the president to assent to the bill, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why this appears to be the only issue. You see, there is no need for you to lobby for any bill to be signed if you are the chairman of the National Assembly, because you are simply a presiding officer, and you coordinate the views of your colleagues.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Honeywell Group Agrees N80bn Deal with Flour Mills of Nigeria",
          "text": "\u2022Transaction will create strong national food champion\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong and Kayode Tokede\n\nThe Honeywell Group Limited has announced an agreement for the proposed combination of Honeywell Flour Mills (HFMP) and Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) for a total enterprise value of N80 billion.\n\nAccording to a statement, through the transaction, the Honeywell Group would dispose of its 71.69 per cent stake in HFMP to FMN, as it seeks to continue its journey of strategically refining and growing its investment portfolio while consolidating in sectors the company currently operates.\n\nAt its core, the proposed merger, which is subject to regulatory approval, would see two businesses come together that have over the years established themselves as innovators and leaders in the food manufacturing industry.\n\nBeyond this, however, it creates a platform for one combined entity to help in Nigeria\u2019s push for food security and the goal of feeding a nation with a booming population of over 200 million. The merger also comes at a strategic time when the opportunities stemming from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) are finally coming to the fore, the statement added.\n\nSpeaking about the transaction, Honeywell Group Limited Managing Director Obafemi Otudeko said, \u201cThis announcement is in line with the evolution of Honeywell Group and our vision of creating value that transcends generations. For over two decades, we have supported Honeywell Flour Mills to build a strong business with a production capacity of 835,000 metric tonnes of food per annum.\n\n\u201cFollowing the transaction, Honeywell Group will be strongly positioned to consolidate and expand its investment activities, including as a partner of choice for investors in key growth sectors.\u201d\n\nTo bolster this point, the Group Managing Director of Flour Mills of Nigeria, Omoboyede Olusanya, said: \u201cThe proposed transaction is aligned with our vision not only to be an industry leader but a national champion for Nigeria. We believe that this will create an opportunity to combine the unique talents of two robust businesses.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we will have a better-rounded and more comprehensive skill set available to us as a combined diversified food business, thus enabling us to better serve our consumers, customers and other stakeholders, whilst providing employees with access to broader opportunities.\u201d\n\nTogether, both companies have a combined track record of more than 85 years and, once completed, this merger will see them bring together the resources and manpower that have led to a wide variety of market-leading products ranging from a combination of Flour Mills of Nigeria\u2019s grain-based foods, sugar, starches, oils, spreads and breakfast cereals to HFMP\u2019s diverse and differentiated range of carbohydrate products.\n\n\u201cUsually, transactions like this raise questions of job security. How many staff will be retained? How many will be let go? Those are important questions worth asking. However, according to official statements, the merger is \u201cabout creating a stronger combined business\u201d to enhance growth prospects and potential future job creation.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t expected to impact the workforce or operations of either business heavily,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAccording to Honeywell, the sheer size of the transaction would even provide employees of the consolidated company with more opportunities to develop their careers and improve the quality of their skills within the parameters of a new and enlarged organisation.\n\n\u201cIn theory, this also means the new company will have even more fuel to inject more jobs into the economy. One of the overall impacts of this deal was the potential for innovation that it creates.\n\n\u201cCurrently, food demands in Nigeria exceed supply. However, the creation of this new entity, first of all, better positions it to produce food at higher capacity and eventually develop a strategic network that encourages export across the world, particularly to Nigerians in the diaspora who remit billions of dollars back to the country every year,\u201d it added.\n\nIt pointed out that HFMP would remain listed for the foreseeable future as it promises to maintain \u201cthe highest standards of corporate governance in the best interest of all shareholders, including minority shareholders.\u201d\n\nTo this end, and per the current capital markets rules, the company stated that it would initiate a Mandatory Takeover Offer (MTO) to allow the minority shareholders to offer their shares at the transaction price.\n\n\u201cAs this deal closes, Honeywell Group intends to continue its journey of refining and growing its investment portfolio.

          "text": "\u2022Stakeholders to determine exact date\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nThe coast appears clear for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to elect a new set of national officers, as President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, gave the party the go-ahead to hold its national convention in February 2022.\n\nBut Chairman of the APC National Caretaker Committee, and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, assured that all stakeholders would be involved in the choice of the particular date in February for the convention.\n\nBriefing newsmen in Abuja after a closed-door meeting with Buhari at the State House, Chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, said the issue of national convention, which was also the highlight of last weekend\u2019s meeting of the APC governors, was tabled before Buhari, who gave the party the go-ahead to hold the convention next February.\n\nBagudu, who was in company with Buni and Jigawa State Governor Abubakar Badaru, said, \u201cYesterday, November 21, the Progressive Governors Forum met and, as some of you might have seen in press reports, I spoke after the meeting, where, in addition to congratulating and thanking the caretaker committee for a wonderful job of their leadership of the party, thanked Mr. President for supporting them to deliver on their mandate.\n\n\u201cI also explained that the Progressive Governors Forum discussed the issue of national convention of the party and they mandated us to come and discuss with the president, as party leader, to give the inputs of the governors so that the party and the president will consider in agreeing a date for the national convention.\u201d\n\nThe governor disclosed that four states were yet to hold their state congresses due to logistic problems. He expressed the hope the between now and January next year, they would have concluded their congresses ahead of the February convention.\n\nBagudu explained, \u201cPart of the inputs we got was that we still have four states, which are in the process of completing their congresses \u2013 Anambra, understandably, because of the election, Zamfara, and two others that because of logistic challenges are yet to complete. Christmas is around the corner, and, then, early January will be very busy with Ekiti.\u201d\n\nBagudu said, \u201cThe governors, based on all that, made an input that we think the party and the president might graciously consider February and the president is favourably disposed and I\u2019m sure the party, because the chairman of the caretaker committee was part of the delegation, he heard that and I\u2019m sure they will conclude between him and the president. But we have made the input of the governors known. It was favourably considered by Mr. President.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Buni said wider consultations would be made among stakeholders before picking a particular date for the convention in February.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have to consult widely and part of the reasons why even the governors met yesterday, 20 of the 22 governors attended. So, it is in consultation to that effect. It is a well consulted, well thought out plan.\n\n\u201cWe will let you know. We have to work on a timetable, which, of course, has to be. We have to communicate it to our various state chapters for them to be ready for the convention. Like the PGF chairman said, they have suggested to the party and Mr. President has concurred. So, we are going ahead to plan for the convention in February.\u201d\n\nBuni also stressed that he would be glad to return to his state as a full time governor after the ad hoc duty of APC caretaker chairman.\n\nRejecting suggestions of possible extension of the caretaker committee\u2019s tenure, Buni declared, \u201cAm I a jobless person, who is always trying to extend his tenure? To do what? I have my primary responsibility as a governor, to go back to my state and carry out my primary responsibility. What I\u2019m here to do is ad hoc, and, of course, to reposition the party, and that is exactly what we\u2019re able to achieve.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Declares matter now out of legislature\u2019s control\n\n\u2022Says N\u2019Assembly expects Buhari to sign Electoral Act\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, yesterday, said governors, who were uncomfortable with the choice of direct primaries as the mode of electing candidates by political parties, should have dialogued with the National Assembly and other stakeholders as against their combative approach, which failed to yield result.\n\nLawan, who said the National Assembly expected nothing less from President Muhammadu Buhari aside signing the 2021 Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law, however, said the matter was now out of the control of the legislature the moment it was transmitted to the president for assent.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen yesterday after meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja, the Senate President said, the National Assembly had done its job by transmitting the recently passed electoral amendment bill 2021 to Buhari and that the expectation was for him to sign it into law.\n\nHe was of the view that President Buhari should not be stampeded into signing the bill until he was properly advised by the relevant Ministers and aides.\n\nSpeaker, House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, had last Thursday said the president was in support of direct primaries after they met at the Presidential Villa.\n\nMany of the governors, across the two main political parties, were against direct primaries and have urged the president not to sign the bill it into law, because of the clause that mandated political parties to conduct direct primaries in selecting candidates.\n\nCommenting on how the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) could ensure stability, when governors as critical stakeholders were not happy with direct parities as contained in the bill, Lawan said: \u201cWell, you see, sometimes this kind of disagreements happen. And when they do, I think the best way forward is for people to engage.\n\n\u201cI always believe, and I\u2019ve conversed for this, that National Assembly members are major stakeholders, governors of APC are major stakeholders and in fact, the presidency is a major stakeholder, in fact, the biggest stakeholder, because it runs the administration, and our party must always try to bring everybody together.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be any day that you will have a political issue that everybody will say the same thing about it that agrees with you without any amendment. So, when we have any section of a party disagreeing with something, we should be engaging.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are politicians. We must have that kind of a platform, where we discuss the issues. Let\u2019s understand each other, and then we make whatever it is that will make this disagreement minimised. Or maybe were possible, eliminated completely.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think it is right to say that governors have disagreed. Maybe some governor\u2019s might have said they don\u2019t like it this way. But that\u2019s normal. So, it\u2019s for us to engage and engage and engage. And I believe that.\u201d\n\nAsked if the legislative arm was ready to let go of direct primaries if need be, the Senate President said: \u201cThis is not something that we should be talking now, because it has passed the legislature and it\u2019s no more with the legislature.\n\n\u201cSo, this is something that is now with Mr. President. If we are talking about the electoral amendment bill, the National Assembly has finished its work. And the bill has been transmitted to Mr. President. And I think at this moment, all eyes will be on what happens to the bill from the executive side rather than the legislature.\n\n\u201cYes, of course, when we send a bill to Mr. President, we expect the bill to be signed. But there are two things that can happen. Mr. President could decide to of course, after consultation with his advisers, sign, or if he doesn\u2019t want to sign he may have his reasons.\n\n\u201cBut I believe that whatever we do in the National Assembly, especially, this Ninth National Assembly, we think deep, we think wide, we will consult very broadly before we take any position. So, I believe that whatever we send to the executive arm of government, Mr. President for his assent, these are things that are well thought out.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that the expectation of members of National Assembly will be that this bill is signed. But this is then again, not my own calling, it is for Mr. President to take his decision.\u201d\n\nOn what the President\u2019s response was, Lawan said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not supposed to tell you what the President said, because Mr. President has his spokespeople. So, I am neither Femi Adesina nor Garba Shehu. And my opinion is National Assembly has done its work. And members of National Assembly have expressed themselves. This is the majority view and is for Mr. president to look at it and of course, expectation of National Assembly is to get the Presidential assent.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on how long he thought it might take the President to assent to the bill, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why this appears to be the only issue. You see, there is no need for you to lobby for any bill to be signed if you are the chairman of the National Assembly, because you are simply a presiding officer, and you coordinate the views of your colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe majority of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House of Representatives say this is where they want the bill to go. This is the provision they want in Section 52, 3 rather. So, I don\u2019t have to come and say Mr. President, sign this. Mr. President has his own processes when a bill is sent to him from the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has the Attorney General and others to advise him. So, why should I stress myself to say, just sign? We expect that he will sign, but how he does that is his calling. And I think we should allow him to just follow the processes he is used to, but the expectation of members of National Assembly is that the bill is signed.\u201d\n\nLawan, however, said his meeting with the President was to consult on the current situation in both the National Assembly and the ruling party, APC.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are considering the 2022 budget and we hope that by the middle of December, or before Christmas, we should be able to consider and pass the budget by the grace of God. Work has reached a very commendable level, as we expected on that. Also, you know that we have impending issues in our party. We have our congresses still to be conducted in few states about two or three. And of course, going forward, how we are able to reconcile the different shades of opinions that are causing disagreements in the party.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that the party, with the endorsement of Mr. President, had constituted a national conciliation committee under the chairmanship of Distinguished Senator Abdullahi Adamu. And we are very optimistic that, the committee with all other leaders in the party, we\u2019ll be able to reconcile our people in different parts of the country, who might have disagreed.\n\n\u201cYou also know that we have legislation that are awaiting the consideration of Mr. President, and for us in the legislature, we\u2019ve finished our job of passing the bills, particularly, the Electoral Act, Amendment Bill, is now for Mr. President, to engage with his assistants and those who normally advise him, for him to take the next most appropriate action.\n\n\u201cWe are also very desirous of ensuring that the the APC is so stable before the Congress, the convention, ultimately, because we want our convention to be hitch-free. We want every member of this party, who comes to attend the convention to do so with a clear mind that whoever becomes the Chairman, for example, whatever leadership emerges, is a leadership that has the respect of everyone in the party, because we want Mr. President to continue to work with a solid and strong party, APC.\n\n\u201cWe want this administration, and President Muhammadu Buhari to continue to do the very good work it is doing across the country and consolidate at the end of his tenure. Before then, we are very hopeful that we are able to have projects, the legacy projects like the second Niger bridge, the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano highway, the Lagos-Ibadan, and, of course, these kind of projects, we want to ensure that we are able to get them commissioned by Mr. President. So, we discussed a lot of things, both in government in the party.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, the security situation in the country can never escape our discussions. And we believe that we have done far so well, in the North East; we have done far so well in the South-south, especially, the Niger Delta. And our challenge is in the North West, and we are determined to ensure that we give the government every possible support. Mr. President wants to ensure that before he leaves, that the Northwest, like the other parts of this country,would experience better stability than we\u2019re enjoying today.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

See Also Corruption N20billion Kogi Workers\u2019 Salary Stolen, Hidden By Governor Bello Returned To Vaults Of Central Bank Of Nigeria \u2013 EFCC\n\nSaharaReporters had in various reports stated that the controversial N20 billion \u2013 meant for workers\u2019 salaries in the state \u2013 was stashed away in a commercial bank account by the state government led by Bello.\n\nAccording to a release by the EFCC obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, the agency said the CBN had recovered the money hidden by the Bello administration into its vaults.\n\nThe EFCC had said, \u201cThe Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, has acknowledged the receipt of the sum of N19, 333,333,333.36 (Nineteen Billion, Three Hundred and Thirty-three Million, Three Hundred and Thirty-three Thousand, Three Hundred and Thirty-three Naira, Thirty-six Kobo) recovered the EFCC from the Kogi State Salary Bail-out account domiciled in Sterling Bank Plc.\n\n\u201cThis effectively puts to rest the campaign of misinformation and unconscionable denials by the Kogi State Government that no fund was recovered from its bail out account. The apex bank in a letter referenced, DFD/DIR/CON/EXT/01/099 and dated 9th November, 2021 informed the Executive Chairman, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa that it has received the money.\n\n\u201cThe letter reads in part: 'We refer to your letter dated November 5, 2021 with Ref. No: CR:3000/EFCC/LS/CMU/REC-STE/VOL.4/047 on the above subject and wish to confirm the details of the receipt of the amount as stated below: Bank: Sterling Bank Plc; Amount: N19, 333, 333,333.36; Date of receipt: 04 November, 2021.' See Also Legal Kogi Government Forfeits N20billion Bailout Funds In Secret Account To Central Bank Of Nigeria\n\n\u201cThe return of the money to the apex bank is in compliance with the October 15, 2021 Order of a Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi Lagos directing the unfreezing of the Kogi State Salary Bail-out account to enable Sterling Bank to remit the balance in the account to the Central Ban of Nigeria. Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke gave the Order pursuant to an application filed by the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe Commission had told the court that the management of Sterling Bank Plc, where the account was domiciled had acknowledged the existence of the said account with the staggering sum of N19, 333,333,333.36 in its books.\n\n\u201cThe Commission further brought to the attention of the court that 'The sum of N19, 333,333,333.36 is still standing in the credit of the account frozen', adding that \u201cthe management of Sterling Bank PIc, has, pursuant to a letter dated 15 September, 2021, signed by its Managing Director, indicated intention to return the total sum of N19, 333,333,333.36 back to the Central Bank of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe release by EFCC Spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, added, \u201cThe EFCC had prayed The court that it \u201cis expedient for the instant suit to be discontinued and the account unfrozen to enable the management of Sterling Bank PIc effect the transfer/ return of the sum of the sum of N19, 333, 333, 333.36 back to the coffer of the Central Bank of Nigeria, where the said bailout funds was disbursed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe transfer has put paid to any further controversy regarding source and ownership of the funds and most importantly, aborted the funds dissipation. On August 31, 2021, Justice Tijani Garba Ringim, a vacation Judge, had ordered the freezing of the account, following an ex-parte application filed by the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC, in a 13-paragraph affidavit in support of the ex-parte application, had stated that it received a credible and direct intelligence, which led to the tracing of the funds reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities in account No. 0073572696 domiciled in Sterling Bank, Plc with the name Kogi State Salary Bailout Account.\n\n\u201cAfter listening to the EFCC application, Justice Ringim on August 31, 2021, ordered the freezing of the account and directed the publication of the order in a national newspaper by the EFCC.\u201d",

          "text": "The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has recommended that Nigeria be designated a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) \u2014 a designation for countries \u201cguilty\u201d of particularly severe violations of religious freedom under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) of 1998 \u2014 every year since 2009. This is based on USCIRF\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe Nigerian government tolerates violence and discrimination on the basis of religion or belief\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs sectarian violence between predominantly Muslim herders and Christian farmers increased, the Nigerian government has failed to implement effective strategies to prevent or stop such violence or to hold perpetrators accountable,\u201d USCIRF said.\n\nIn 2011 when President Goodluck Jonathan was in power USCIRF recommended that Nigeria be designated a CPC.\n\nThen in 2013, USCIRF restated its recommendation that Nigeria be labelled a CPC, saying Jonathan failed to hold accountable perpetrators of religiously-related violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government\u2019s failure to prosecute perpetrators of religiously-related violence only encourages reprisals and intensifies local tensions and mistrust. Boko Haram uses this impunity as a recruitment tool and to justify its attacks on Christians,\u201d USCIR chair, Katrina Lantos Swett, said at the time.\n\nIn December 2019, the US placed Nigeria on its Special Watch-List (SWL) for governments that have engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom.\n\nThe blacklisting did not come until December 2020, when the US finally designated Nigeria a CPC under President Muhammadu Buhari after a spate of killings in the north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Pompeo, former US Secretary of State who announced the measure, did not state the particular infraction(s) that warranted Nigeria\u2019s designation as a CPC but said: \u201cno country or entity should be allowed to persecute people with impunity because of their beliefs\u201d.\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN CPC, SWL\n\nCPCs are defined as countries whose governments either engage in or tolerate \u201cparticularly severe violations\u201d of religious freedom during the reporting year. Particularly severe violations of religious freedom are defined as \u201csystematic, ongoing, egregious violations of the internationally recognized right to freedom of religion\u201d, such as torture or degrading treatment or punishment. USCIRF\u2019s annual reports identify countries that it concludes meets the CPC standard and recommend that the State Department designate these countries as such.\n\nOn the other hand, the SWL applies to countries that do not meet all of the CPC criteria but nonetheless have \u201cengaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom\u201d during the reporting year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis implies that the SWL is a less implicating designation than the CPC.\n\nWHY AND HOW DOES A COUNTRY GET DESIGNATED?\n\nThe US Department of State said a country is designated of particular concern when it \u201cengaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom\u201d.\n\nThe IRFA defines particularly severe violations of religious freedom as \u201dsystematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom, including violations such as torture, degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged detention without charges, abduction or clandestine detention, or other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of persons\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt explained that such designation could attract economic measures against enlisted countries and that congress is first notified when a country is blacklisted as a result of violations of religious freedom.\n\n\u201cAnd where non-economic policy options designed to bring about cessation of the particularly severe violations of religious freedom have reasonably been exhausted, an economic measure generally must be imposed,\u201d it said.\n\nThe US issued a waiver on taking any action against Nigeria when it was designated \u201cas required in the \u2018important national interest of the United States,\u2019 pursuant to section 407 of the Act\u201d.\n\nWHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE DELISTED?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, when Nigeria was included in the SWL, Pompeo said Sudan had been moved from CPC to SWL \u201cdue to significant steps taken by the civilian-led transitional government to address the previous regime\u2019s \u201csystematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom\u201d.\n\nIn the statement announcing the designation of Nigeria as a CPC in 2020, Pompeo also announced that Sudan and Uzbekistan had been removed from the SWL.\n\n\u201cThere are also positive developments to share. I am pleased to announce that Sudan and Uzbekistan have been removed from the Special Watch List based on significant, concrete progress undertaken by their respective governments over the past year. Their courageous reforms of their laws and practices stand as models for other nations to follow,\u201d Pompeo had said.\n\nHowever, the US government did not state why Nigeria was delisted as a CPC and what steps the country had taken to earn being delisted.\n\nUnlike how it went from being on the SWL to CPC, Nigeria did not transition back to SWL before being removed from the CPC. The USCIRF however, did not state if this is the standard process.\n\nParts of the measures the US can take against a CPC designation include denials of credit loans under OPIC or the Export-Import Bank; directing the US executive directors of international financial institutions to oppose and vote against loans primarily benefiting the specific foreign government, agency, instrumentality, or official found or determined by the president to be responsible for violations; denials of exports under certain instruments such as the Arms Export Control Act, prohibiting the US government from procuring goods or services from the government, entities, or officials responsible for violations.\n\nBut Because Nigeria was granted a waiver, the country did not suffer any of the sanctions. The IRFA also allows negotiating a bilateral agreement concerning the cessation of violations. It is, however, unclear if the US and Nigerian governments pursued this option.\n\nFemi Adesina, presidential spokesman, claimed that the US had to remove Nigeria from the watchlist because it realised that the initial placement was not based on facts.\n\nAccording to him, the US government was fed with \u201cincorrect positions\u201d by the citizens of Nigeria about what is happening in the country.\n\nREACTIONS AFTER NIGERIA\u2019S REMOVAL AS A CPC\n\nThe USCIRF which recommended the blacklisting of Nigeria in 2020, said it is disappointed that State Department delisted Nigeria from the CPC list.\n\n\u201cUSCIRF is disappointed that the State Department did not adopt our recommendations in designating the countries that are the worst violators of religious freedom,\u201d Nadine Maenza, USCIRF Chair, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile the State Department took steps on some designations, USCIRF is especially displeased with the removal of Nigeria from its CPC designation, where it was rightfully placed last year, as well as the omission of India, Syria, and Vietnam. We urge the State Department to reconsider its designations based on facts presented in its own reporting.\u201d\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said Christians all over Nigeria are still facing persecution from terrorist groups, wondering the data or statistics used by the US government in arriving at the decision to remove Nigeria from the list.\n\nSamson Ayokunle, CAN national president, asked the US government to \u201chelp us by allowing us to know what has changed between the time our country was put in the list of \u2018countries of particular concern\u2019 and now\u201d.\n\nNIGERIA\u2019S DELISTING AND IMPLICATION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS\n\nThe USCIRF said in its March 2021 factsheet on IRFA that \u201cin recognition that religious freedom violations can drive displacement, IRFA includes further provisions on U.S. refugee and asylum policy.\n\n\u201cIn addition to requiring trainings on religious persecution for immigration officials, IRFA mandates the president to consider information about religious persecution as part of his annual determination of refugee admissions, and that immigration officials use the IRF Report as a resource in adjudicating refugee and asylum claims.\u201d\n\nSeveral Nigerians have taken undue advantage of the blacklisting of Nigeria to seek asylum in the US over claims of religious persecution, even when the case is not so.\n\nIn November 2017, Legal Aid Ontario, a non-profit legal agency, expressed worry that Nigerian asylum seekers in Canada may be fabricating similar claims of sexual orientation persecution.\n\nJawad Kassab, leader, refugee and immigration programme at Legal Aid Ontario, said the agency has identified an unusual pattern in sexual orientation claims filed by Nigerian refugee seekers that year.\n\nKassab said he was concerned that if the claims are fabricated, it might thwart the chances of refugees with legitimate claims.\n\nIn the context of the US-Nigeria situation, many Nigerians may no longer be able to leverage on the now lifted designation of Nigeria as a CPC. Hence, there may be a drop in the number of asylum seekers accepted into the US, especially those with claims of religious persecution.",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "A few streets away from Eko Atlantic City, the doors to the exhibition halls of Gallery B57 are open, revealing a black and white portrait of Instagram Influencer, Sanchan.\n\nPortrait of Instagram influencer, Sanchan\n\nLast year, during the global lockdown, Nigerian-born international visual artist, Ade Adekola, made an open call on Instagram for people who were interested in having their photographs turned into portraits. He opened a sign-up form with a commitment to do 30 portraits, but when he opened the form two hours later, the number of requests had exceeded 80. He had to close the call immediately to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nDuring the process of creating the portraits\u2014all 80 of them\u2014he was able to improve his creative process, developing new techniques that helped him optimise the way he worked. He took the original photographs shared by interested persons, stripped them of all colours, turning them into black and white. He then turned them into engravings, before shading, cutting, and colouring them. Optimising this process, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback he received from his 80 selected muses, encouraged him to create more portraits.\n\nIn the end, Adekola created 700 portraits, but there are only 40 portraits with striking designs and a collage of all 700 portraits on display at the exhibition halls of the gallery.\n\nThe allure of the 40 portraits on display, chosen by Adekola for their unique poses, circumstance or personal resonance to the subject, was elevated by presenting it in lightboxes.\n\nNow titled Lockdown Portraits, his project would go on to form a part of his exhibition titled, Dislocation &\u2026 alongside Anthology of an African Wedding and Diaspora Axis.\n\nOpening up conversations for dislocated people\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is an exhibition featuring NFT art, 3D textiles and augmented reality and events that feature creators from Tokyo, Israel and Singapore on social media and other digital collaborative platforms.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition were conceived, executed and completed during the year-long lockdown, exploring and amplifying the effects of dislocation on humanity.\n\nIn Diaspora Axis, Adekola took a blend of various nationalities and used it to create a textile design. Ade set out to give agency to people with double or more nationalities, who were confused about their \u201ctrue identities\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, the inspiration for the anthology series, from that disability perspective, are people who had an emotional roadmap, and that roadmap was truncated. I just open up the space for you to enter and think about what may or could have happened.\u201d\n\nThe design was adopted by an Israeli company to create and display dresses. Using 3D, over 70 design patterns are shown to consumers. \u201cSo, when you buy it, they send the physical garment to you, all cut,\u201d Adekola explained.\n\nA pandemic is a form of dislocation to Adekola, who said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore the different kinds of dislocation forces. So, the pandemic is a kind of dislocation where people are in isolation\u2014a prolonged one.\u201d\n\nBuying African emotional entanglement\n\nA scene from Anthology of an African Wedding\n\nAnthology of an African Wedding collection explores dislocation from the angle of emotional entanglement in Yoruba wedding cultures. The Yoruba nation hails from the southwest region of Nigeria, and their wedding culture is colourful, vibrant, and in many ways, extravagant.\n\nViewable using augmented reality, Anthology of an African Wedding collection brings viewers a step closer to experiencing a Yoruba wedding with its traditional gowns, headgear and rings.\n\nAdekola has evolved his art using Photoshop for over 20 years, creating over 20,000 texture designs that he used to create Anthology of an African Wedding. Anthology of an African Wedding, which also sells as an NFT on OpenSea, consists of 18 art pieces\u20149 showing traditional wedding scenes and 9 white wedding ones.\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is on display at Gallery B57 until December 1st.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which is \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 million from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most-watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest-earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most-watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper-competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in-app integrations. But, as none of these payment apps is widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller microtransactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for the Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest-growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Immediately you launch your career as an artiste and record some success, you\u2019re like a business operating and generating revenue with customers in over 70 countries. At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life. Expectedly, though, he takes on a new life when he has to match his fans\u2019 energy and excitement at shows and events.\n\nSince gaining popularity, Mr Eazi\u2019s reputation has grown in leaps and bounds, preceding him even beyond the music scene.\n\nThere was a funny moment. as we spoke. when he revealed his spontaneity and unpredictability. What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi). Source: Supplied\n\nA look at the mark the young artiste has made in a short time shows that he is clearly motivated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who is fascinated with seeing ideas come to life. There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. A mechanical engineering graduate, Oluwatosin traded FMCGs and gold before deciding to stick to music.\n\nHis friends crowdfunded $1,000 for him to shoot his first video. And in an interview with Coachella in 2019, he said his current achievements wouldn\u2019t have been possible without their show of largesse.\n\nThis perhaps explains his strong commitment to investing in up-and-coming talents in Africa, nurturing them along their path.\n\nApparently, music has always been a hobby for Mr Eazi. This explains his interest in many other business ventures for which he has justifications.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cthe similarities between a musician or a creative as a startup and a business became very glaring to me; it\u2019s almost the same thing.\u201d\n\nHe compared a founder pitching their idea to a creative coming forward to sell their unique product. In hindsight, this understanding is what has guided him towards success in every venture he has undertaken.\n\nMr Eazi also has an obsession, and you get no prizes for guessing that it is linked to the creative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been driven by freedom, and I\u2019ve been obsessed with this from early in life.\u201d\n\nIn context, it was the entrepreneurship spirit. Oluwatosin wanted to have the creative freedom to try his hands on anything he put his mind to.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurship truly makes me free,\u201d he said as we continued our chat, oblivious of the passing of time.\n\nIt has always been music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi on stage. Source: Instagram\n\nMany artistes are known for their signature intros, which can be phrases or chants, and Mr Eazi is identified by \u201cZagadat.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure what it means, but whenever you hear it, everyone knows Don Eazi is about to hit the stage or screen.\n\nThe longer we spoke, the more difficult it was to distinguish between Mr Eazi, the artiste, the startup founder/CEO, and the investor.\n\nAnd when we started talking about how he successfully wears many hats, he told me why he made music the fulcrum of all he does.\n\n\u201cI read Jay-Z\u2019s book, Empire State of Mind, and it felt like I\u2019d seen the blueprint, the future, and what could come out of it. That\u2019s why I decided that of all the things I was passionate about that showed traction, and it was going to be music.\n\n\u201cI always knew it would come to this phase where I get influential enough for the music to open doors for me and provide the cash flow needed to have more creative freedom.\u201d\n\nMr Eazi always had the spirit of entrepreneurship. While studying in Ghana, he started bringing artistes to his university as he ran an entertainment business on the side.\n\nWhen the artiste still had a softer image, he released mixtapes that attracted local and international audiences. Life is Eazi Vol.1 \u2013 Accra To Lagos and Life is Eazi Vol. 2 \u2013 Lagos to London particularly got massive streams, with the first at number four on Billboard\u2019s World Album charts, and the other, the most-streamed Nigerian Album in 2018.\n\nIn July 2016, Mr Eazi held a hugely successful headline show in London, which he said convinced him that he was on the right path. Earlier in 2021, he celebrated five years of leaving his mobile phone trading startup, Phonetrader Nigeria, to focus on music.\n\nHowever, I believe he started getting attention before then. In 2015, he had a hit record, Skin Tight. Then in 2016, he became a man of the moment with Leg Over.\n\nEven though there was never a particular moment when he decided he wanted to become an artiste, Oluwatosin made bold to say that every other aspect of his entrepreneurship life leverages the fact that he\u2019s Mr Eazi, the artiste.\n\n\u201cI was just doing exactly what I was doing, which is creating. And this has opened doors for me in my entire career.\u201d\n\nAnd once he recognised people\u2019s growing interest in what he created, he continued to improve.\n\nMany moments stand out for Oluwatosin in his musical career, but he referenced one of his firsts.\n\n\u201cOne of my proudest creations so far is my COMO UN BEB\u00c9, my song with J Balvin and Bad Bunny last year. I think that was a big moment for me because it took me one year to get into the Latin music scene.\u201d\n\nFun fact: Mr Eazi invented Banku, a style of music that\u2019s a mix of Ghanaian and Nigerian pop. He was the only African that featured on two tracks on Beyonce\u2019s The Lion King soundtrack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for African music right now. There used to be one artiste having the moment, and it felt like the next person had to wait their turn. But right now, the space is such that multiple people are simultaneously having their moments, recording individual worldwide success.\u201d\n\nMr Eazi as an investor \u2014 building Africa\u2019s first music incubator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Twitter\n\nMr Eazi has built a reputation for nurturing and promoting African talents. And he does this through several initiatives, emPawa Africa being the most popular.\n\nLaunched in 2019, it is an incubator that provides artistes with funding and resources to market their music, access radio and TV airplay, and train them to become independent music entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cHaving a music company that represents different parts of Africa, which is what we\u2019ve been able to do in the two years of setting up, is great.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria\u2019s Joeboy and Ghana\u2019s J Derobe were discovered through this incubation programme.\n\nAnd the initiative keeps evolving. Mr Eazi revealed that setting up a formidable team that ensures the business runs smoothly in his absence would be a major achievement.\n\nAt this point, I wanted to know how the initiative is funded, especially since he is an independent artiste running his music business with personal funds.\n\n\u201cemPawa Africa started with funding from the music business. My music career was able to supply the cash to start emPawa Africa. In fact, before emPawa, the revenue from my music career was used to run my other businesses.\n\nThere was another source of funding \u2014 a convertible loan \u2014 from now defunct 88mph, and the business is currently in the process of closing another fundraise.\n\nMr Eazi and his friends also run Zadagat Capital, a syndicate fund that invests in the African tech space. Asides from three others not yet in the press, the latest startup in its portfolio is PawaPay, an Africa-focused payments startup, announced in August 2021.\n\nAfricans supporting Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m investing in music and also in businesses that intersect with the creative industry. It\u2019s more like an alternative merch for my fans.\u201d\n\nThere are other investment ventures associated with the Mr Eazi brand.\n\nIn 2020, he launched the African Music Fund (AMF) with an initial raise of $20 million. This fund provides financial support for African musicians to expand and distribute their music content and increase revenue.\n\nDepending on the contract signed, AMF not only funds an artiste but also manages their brand and ensures growth. AMF recoups its initial investment in instalments.\n\nMr Eazi also wants Africans to have equity in African businesses. Apart from the syndicate, another way he plans to do this is by allowing his fans to make revenue from his content.\n\nThis is quite similar to how record labels operate. When labels sign an artiste, they make an investment and get a percentage of the artiste\u2019s gains.\n\n\u201cThe money is an advance on future earnings. Being an independent artiste, I\u2019m thinking of how to engage my fans more. I\u2019m like, \u2018Why not get the fans to actually participate and have equity in the success they create?\u2019\u201d\n\nEarlier in the year, he announced that this would kick off with his album due for release in 2022. Fans can invest in the album, knowing that over time, as they listen, they will get revenue commensurate with their investment.\n\nThere\u2019s more to Don Eazi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been travelling a lot, I\u2019m trying not to be on tour till next year after the album release. The major thing I\u2019m doing this year is making the album and doing a lot of stuff with Zagadat Capital.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Eazi is gracing a few stages to keep in touch with his fans. For the better part of 2021, he has performed in a few shows and strategic concerts in New York, Miami, Sacramento, Johannesburg, and the UK.\n\nBesides creating music and investing, Mr Eazi loves movies; he even thinks he\u2019d do well as an actor. The Don also loves comedy, gaming, travelling, and studying history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, November 19, 2021, Torilo, a tech company headquartered in the UK with a presence in Nigeria building cutting edge tech solutions for business growth and development launched its latest product \u2014 Bizedge.\n\nBizedge is a productivity/business management tool that offers services that range from human resources, accounting to payroll, asset management and even generating error-free documents.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Oluwaseun Farinre, CEO and Head of design, Torilo Nigeria said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always asked ourselves how we can help businesses make better output because we understand the pain.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwaseun Farinre admits that the team understands the struggle behind running a business and building a solution that eases this struggle is something the team has always thought about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore its development into what is known today as Bizedge, Oluwaseun says it only started as a problem they saw everyone facing and knew they had to create a solution.\n\n\u201cIt was a problem of dealing with so much paperwork, it was a problem of lack of proper accounting and knowing what to do to improve business operations.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, he revealed that finding a solution to this problem had been in the works for the past three years but building Bizedge started two years ago.\n\nInitially called Bizedge Plus, because the range of tools within the software was so much, the team decided to stick with Bizedge because the goal is to give businesses the edge they need to function efficiently and grow faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBizedge: the future of work\n\nThe Bizedge suite has a wide array of productivity modules, eliminating the need of moving from one app to another.\n\nProduct Manager, Aderinola Adebanjo, says Bizedge is flipping the coin and changing the productivity tool narrative.\n\nAlthough Bizedge already has so much packed within one tool, Adebanjo says the team is working tirelessly to add more modules to the suite.\n\nBeing a tool created for all kinds of businesses, ranging from sole proprietorships to large businesses, Bizedge offers tutorial videos and effective customer support that\u2019ll help users get accustomed to using the tool and making the best of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of cost, Temitope Adelanwa, Bizedge Product Marketer, stated that the suite has a free and premium plan. The modules such as payroll and HR are in the premium plan while other modules are available for free.\n\nIs your data secure with Bizedge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Odunayo, Senior Partner at Torilo group, points out that Torilo has its core background in database management, working with notable companies such as Telegraph Media Group, Capita Financials & Sony.\n\nHe said these companies have trusted Torilo with data for close to a decade, hence, data security can be assured as their reputation speaks for itself.\n\nIn the case of a data breach, Odunayo is confident that Torilo can recover to the second. As he stated at the event, \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through a lot of sessions to ensure we have a very robust world grade system, in the unlikely event that it happens, we also have a very solid system to ensure that things are up and running.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2012, Torilo has birthed other innovative products besides Bizedge since its inception.\n\nOdunayo recounted the beginnings of the company as a couple of Nigerians coming together in the UK to provide technical needs in terms of data and database management.\n\nStarting out with just one client in its inception, Torilo has grown. It now has multiple clients such as Telegraph Media Group, Capita Financials.\n\nThe growth was exponential according to Odunayo and after five years the company decided to set up in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we came to Nigeria we had to look at the market and understand the market better.\u201d The company kicked things off in Nigeria with IQ, followed by Torilo Academy which trains people in software engineering, digital marketing and product design among others. Graduands have gone on to work in prestigious tech companies.\n\nWith Bizedge however, the company is just getting started. The team promises more tools like one that helps with tax. With the tools embedded within the suite, Bizedge could very well become the future of work in a very short period of time.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This comes with a change of name for the Ugandan startup. For Treepz, this is the second acquisition in less than four months.\n\nIn August, it was Ghanian startup, Stabus. Both acquisitions were financed through a $1.3m seed funding and a $1.5m extension.\n\nAn eventful 2021: Founded by Onyeka Akumah, Enagwolor Johnny, John Shaibu, and Oluseyi Afolabi in 2019, Plentywaka has made notable strides in 2021. In March 2021, it announced its entry into Techstars Toronto, one of the most impressive startup accelerators.\n\nTwo acquisitions and a $2.8 million seed investment caps what has been an eventful year.

That seemed a reasonable explanation.\n\nHowever, in a chat with TechCrunch, Abeg\u2019s founders maintained that the company raised a pre-seed round from local investors and completely dismissed claims that Piggytech paid its BBN sponsorship.\n\nLaunched in 2020, and likened to the US mobile payment service, Cash App, Abeg is a fintech platform that allows users to request and send money using unique usernames called tags. After its launch, the startup grew to 5000 users with little to no marketing at all.\n\nSponsoring BBN helped the startup acquire 2 million users. Not a shabby return considering it spent $2 million from its pre-seed raise from local investors, and this was probably one of the largest pre-seed by a Nigerian startup. Too bad the numbers were not announced.\n\nBut, there\u2019s a lot more to the story, and there are some intriguing conversations to be had about Abeg\u2019s future and its relationship with Piggytech limited.\n\nGo deeper: Nigerian fintech Abeg faces its biggest test yet after blitzscaling to millions of users\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nInterview with Mr Eazi; artiste, tech bro, investor, goes live today by 12 pm\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThis article was entirely generated by an AI.

          "text": "A whirring machine churns out prints at the Gaza Printing Press in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri while owner Garba Zango supervises. The copies are perfect, but his costs have lately gone through the roof.\n\nA report by Reuters says the past 10 months have been the toughest of Zango\u2019s nearly 50-year career as his city of 800,000 struggles without power from the national grid.\n\n\u201cEvery aspect of life \u2013 everything \u2013 has changed in Maiduguri,\u201d Zango, 66, said. \u201cIf we were getting 10 naira profit (per unit before), profits have now fallen to 2 or 3 naira.\u201d\n\nMaiduguri is the capital of Borno state, the epicentre of Nigeria\u2019s 12-year battle against Islamist militants who in January bombed transmission lines, cutting the city\u2019s power and stifling efforts to rebuild its economy.\n\n\u201cYou have a city that is trying to recover\u2026This has now thrown a spanner in the works,\u201d Institute for Security Studies researcher Teniola Tayo said.\n\nElectricity access is a problem across Nigeria due to poor infrastructure despite the oil wealth that makes it Africa\u2019s biggest energy producer, but virtually all cities have at least intermittent grid power.

          "text": "Oil major Shell is expanding its footprint in the power businesses as a way to engender future growth in the face of growing climate concerns, an approach that has seen it buy successful power businesses around the world.\n\nThe latest acquisition is the purchase of Powershop Australia, an online energy retailer with over 185,000 customers. This comes barely four months after it acquired a renewable energy retail supplier Inspire Energy Capita based in California and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Nigeria, just weeks ago, Shell officially launched its new outfit, Shell Energy Nigeria which aims to deliver competitive and reliable energy for power generation and industrial users and to develop gas distribution to serve people in new regions.\n\nThe impact of climate change is forcing a reckoning with fossil fuel, a development that could disrupt the business strategies of oil companies. To deal with this reality, oil companies are diversifying into related energy businesses.\n\nPower business seems to be Shell\u2019s biggest gambit to meet its net-zero goals. Achieving Shell\u2019s net-zero emissions target could mean that Shell doubles the amount of electricity it currently sells and provides enough renewable electricity to power 50 million households by 2030.\n\nOther oil companies are embarking on power business but Shell\u2019s plan appears the most ambitious. In 2019, the company said it was investing between $1 billion and $2 billion yearly in energy technologies including electricity out of its $25bn yearly capital expenditure budget.\n\nShell is capitalising on the weaknesses of legacy power plants sourcing generation from coal, nuclear and some thermal plants bogged by debts and inefficiency and thinks it can deliver better value using its vast retail experience and network around the world.\n\nThe company said the acquisition of Powershop is in line with Shell\u2019s Powering Progress strategy and ambition to create an integrated power business.\n\nPowershop will form Shell\u2019s residential power platform in Australia, extending Shell\u2019s existing position as Australia\u2019s largest dedicated retailer of electricity to commercial and industrial customers.\n\nUnder the arrangement with ICG, Shell Energy will also acquire wind power purchase agreements (PPAs) and has agreed on offtake arrangements with ICG associated with MEA\u2019s hydro and wind assets.\n\nRead also: Seplat Energy\u2019s gas development, a major carbon reduction move, says CEO\n\n\u201cOur aim is to become a leading provider of clean power-as-a-service and this acquisition broadens our customer portfolio in Australia to include households,\u201d said Shell\u2019s Executive Vice President of Renewables and Energy Solutions Elisabeth Brinton.\n\nBrinton said Shell\u2019s presence across the entirety of the changing energy system means \u201cwe are well-placed to manage complexity for customers so that we deliver simple, cleaner energy solutions.\u201d\n\nShell Australia chairman Tony Nunan said: \u201cThis acquisition is another example of how we are continuing to grow our footprint in Australia to meet customers\u2019 evolving needs through the energy transition. Powershop today offers innovative energy packages, and customers will benefit in the future from access to Shell\u2019s broader suite of energy solutions linked to e-mobility and battery storage.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will take place through the 100 percent acquisition of Meridian Energy Australia Group, the parent company of Powershop, by a consortium of Shell and Infrastructure Capital Group (ICG), an Australian infrastructure investor and manager. Under the terms of the deal, Shell will acquire Powershop and ICG will acquire MEA\u2019s portfolio of renewable generation assets and development projects.\n\nThe acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals. It is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.\n\nIn Nigeria, Shell Energy Shell Energy Nigeria\u2019s gas solutions are designed to partner with other sources of energy \u2013 including renewables \u2013 to provide competitively priced and flexible energy, while helping the country to transition to a lower-carbon energy system.\n\nThe new business will draw on the capabilities and experience of Shell from a portfolio of natural gas, power and environmental products. It offers a comprehensive selection of energy solutions available from a single supplier and made possible by one of the industry\u2019s largest trading operations, the company said in a release.\n\nCountry chair of Shell Company in Nigeria, Osagie Okunbor, said Shell Energy Nigeria brings to Nigeria Shell\u2019s decades of marketing and trading experience, a wealth of market knowledge and its ability to integrate energy solutions to support economic development in Nigeria.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s budding preventive healthcare market has attracted a fresh bet from a growing global firm, Healthlane, aiming to democratise access to optimised precautionary health services to all Nigerians.\n\nThe digital health company joins a slew of big private investments that have localised operations in Africa\u2019s largest economy in a year racing to cope with the new normal of a pandemic world.\n\nWith an anchor plan that enables access to over 70 wellness screenings in 45 minutes, Healthlane hopes to simplify processes around healthcare optimisation in the country with smart technological resources that generate fast and accurate data for personalised care on the go.\n\nIt also aims to grab a substantial stake from the rising shift from sick care to a preventive healthcare technologies and services market estimated to hit $493.1 billion by 2027 globally, according to a 2021 UnivDatos Market Insights.\n\nThe report states that the key driver of the uptick in demand for preventive healthcare technologies and services is the rising prevalence of chronic diseases; lifestyle-associated diseases, as well as the surging aged population across the globe.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s Healthcare sector faces major disruption with launch of Leadway Health\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated interests in preventive care as people living with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, cancers and heart-related challenges have taken preventive measures more seriously, the report shows.\n\nAlain Nteff, Healthlane\u2019s chief executive, says Nigeria\u2019s life expectancy data could improve from the average age of between 54 and 55 years to around 70 to 80 if regular wellness checks were widely accessible to track vital signs and determine the individual state of health.\n\nThe company has invested about 12 months of research globally in best protocols, engaging physicians in the United States, Dubai, Nigeria, and Cameroon to design a model that helps people live longer, Nteff discloses.\n\nHealth checks on the platform cover the heart, kidney, liver, blood, cancer, diabetes, hormones, bones and minerals, and others.\n\n\u201cThe majority of what we have is sick care which is about a $5 million market. At Healthlane, we believe healthcare is really around eating, exercising, supplementing, having check-ups, and immunising yourself. If you get this right, it will add extra decades to your years and avoid losing loved ones to silly things. Our goal is to help every Nigerian be in good health,\u201d Nteff states while speaking at the unveiling of the mobile product in Lagos.\n\nWhile data on the spate of growth in Nigeria\u2019s preventive care market remains scant, data show it is a growth area in some developed countries, especially the US. The country, for instance, operates a patient protection and affordable \u201ccare act\u201d that includes preventive healthcare on insurance provision at no added cost.\n\nThe total health innovation funding reached $9.1 billion in the first half of 2020, 19 percent more than $7.7 billion invested during the same period in 2019, according to a report.\n\nIt was found that nearly 80 percent of healthcare data executives are upping their investments in big data analytics and artificial intelligence, which would positively impact the market growth.\n\nHealthlane, like peers, has also begun to chase such prospects in Nigeria and Cameroon and has short-term expansion plans to other African big cities such as Nairobi, Kenya, and Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nNteff says long-term plans to establish in Dubai, Europe, and the US are also afoot.\n\nLincoln Saiki, an in-house physician at Healthlane, says partnerships have been formed with health insurance companies including Leadway and Reliance to spread end users\u2019 access to the services.\n\n\u201cThe actual healthcare check is the first step on your health journey. In the long run, from the comfort of your home, your mobile app will constantly educate you on what you need to do, based on your unique health needs,\u201d Saiki states.",

          "title": "#EndSARS: Lagos panel report filled with errors, Lai Mohammed claims",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has dismissed the report on the Lekki toll gate violence, delivered by the Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution at the Lagos Court of Arbitration, as one riddled with \u201cerrors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that are not supported by evidence\u201d.\n\nThe report, against claims by the federal government, concluded that Nigerian soldiers and police on October 20, 2020, shot and killed unarmed protesters while they were waving the Nigerian flag and singing the national anthem during a protest against police brutality.\n\nDespite multiple evidence, including investigations published by PREMIUM TIMES and CNN, the Nigerian government denied the attack took place. It claimed there were no bodies to prove a massacre occured.\n\nThe judicial panel in its report dismissed the government\u2019s claims, and confirmed dozens of peaceful protesters were killed at the toll gate by state agents.\n\nMr Mohammed, who has led the government\u2019s campaign to deny the events, finally reacted the report on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, he claimed the report cannot be relied upon because its authenticity is in doubt.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, let me say that never in the history of any Judicial Panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions, and conclusions that are not supported by evidence. What is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cIt is simply incredible that a Judicial Panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance. Instead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time. That report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201ccritical analyses\u201d of the report by a courageous few have been read.\n\n\u201cOne commentator, a lawyer, said it raised more questions than answers. Another commentator, a journalist, called it a \u2018disgraceful report by a disgraceful panel\u2019, saying it reported allegations instead of investigating the allegations. Yet another wondered how a Judicial Panel could use the words \u2018massacre in context\u2019 and equate such to a massacre. All these and many more have raised valid questions on that report. We salute their courage and refusal to be cowed by the rampaging lynch mob that has been screaming blue murder since the report was released,\u201d Mr Mohammed said.\n\nHe also noted that the Lagos State Government, being the convening authority, has yet to release any official report to the public.\n\n\u201cNeither has the panel done so. The cowardly leakage of an unsigned report to the public is not enough. Assuming the report in circulation bears any iota of genuineness, it is basic knowledge that the report of such a panel is of no force until the convening authority issues a White Paper and Gazette on it. It is therefore too premature for any\n\nperson or entity to seek to castigate the Federal Government and its agencies or officials based on such an unofficial and unvalidated report,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out what he believed to be errors made by the government-appointed panel.\n\n\u201cWe do not intend to bore you by rehashing details of the discrepancies, innuendoes, inconsistencies, and errors in that report. They are already in the public space. Let us, however, point out some key highlights of such discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc.\n\ni) \u2013 The report threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it. The experts said, inter alia, in their testimony:\n\n\u201dThe Team finds that from the medical data examined, including the timeline of arrival at the medical facility and the nature of the injuries sustained by the victims, who were taken to the 5 medical facilities, that no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the timeframe of reference (18.30- 20.34hrs). That the GSW (Gun Shot Wounds) injuries (4 in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were\n\nexamined by the Team, can be safely identified as being discharged by either low-velocity caliber and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms (artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons).\n\n\u201cWhat is however certain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military-grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded. This was clearly not the case.\n\nii) \u2013 The same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which post mortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying nine persons died of gunshot wounds at Lekki!\n\niii) \u2013 The man whose evidence (that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left for dead before he escaped) was found to be crucial by the panel never testified in person. Rather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was\n\nshot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night!\n\niv) \u2013 The panel said trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Toll Gate in the morning of Oct. 21 2020 to clean up bloodstains and other evidence, but still found bullet casings at the same site when it visited on October 20, 2020. It said soldiers picked up bullet casings from Lekki Toll Gate on the night of October 20, 2020, yet claimed that policemen came to the same spot to pick the same bullet casings on October 21, 2020!\n\nv) \u2013 The panel was silent on the family members of those reportedly killed, merely insinuating they were afraid to testify. Even goats have owners who will look for them if they do not return home, not to talk of human beings. Where are the family members\n\nof those who were reportedly killed at Lekki Toll Gate? If the panel is recommending compensation for the families, what are their identities and addresses? Who will receive the compensations when no family members have shown up to date?\n\nvi) \u2013 How did a man who reported seeing the lifeless body of his brother himself end up being on the list of the panel\u2019s deceased persons?\n\nvii) \u2013 How can a Judicial Panel convince anyone that the names of some casualties of the Lekki Toll Gate incident listed as numbers 3 (Jide), 42 (Tola), and 43 (Wisdom) are not fictitious names.\n\nviii) \u2013 Why did the Judicial Panel feel compelled to concoct a \u201dmassacre in context\u201d as a euphemism for \u201dmassacre\u201d? A massacre is a massacre. What is \u201dmassacre in context?\u201d\n\nix) \u2013 The report never mentioned cases of police personnel who were brutally murdered or the massive destruction of police stations, vehicles, e.t c during the Endsars protest. Does this mean that the panel didn\u2019t consider policemen and women as human beings?\n\nx) \u2013 The report didn\u2019t make any recommendation on the innocent people whose businesses were attacked and destroyed during the protest in Lagos. I think it was too busy looking for evidence to support its conclusion of \u2018massacre in context\u2019.\n\nHe concluded that the report is not only laden with errors but also did not pass proper scrutiny.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, there is absolutely nothing in the report that is circulating to make us change our stand that there was no massacre at Lekki on\n\nOctober 20, 2020. For us to change our stand, a well-investigated report of the incident that meets all required standards and will withstand every scrutiny must be produced and presented to the public. The report in circulation does not meet those requirements. We also appeal to the families of those allegedly killed in Lekki to speak out. It\u2019s untenable to say that some families did not come out because they were afraid. Any parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worth being called a parent.\n\n\u201cWe reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at Lekki on October 20, 2020. That conclusion is not supported by the weight of available evidence. Indictment for murder is a very serious issue that cannot be done on the basis of allegations and corroborations, as the panel did. Such allegations must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the Federal Government and its agencies without foolproof evidence. The Federal Government has never condoned the abuse of the rights of Nigerians by security agencies under any guise, hence it disbanded SARS and encouraged states to set up the panels to investigate reports of human rights abuses allegedly committed by the disbanded SARS personnel.\n\n\u201cThe 37 policemen and six soldiers who died across the country during the Endsars protest are also Nigerians and should not be forgotten.\n\n\u201cThose who have engaged in premature celebration of the report in circulation should now go back and read it thoroughly and tell Nigerians whether it can pass any serious scrutiny.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened that anyone died at all during the Endsars protest as the life of every Nigerian and indeed every human is sacrosanct. As we have disclosed many times, 57 civilians, 37 policemen, and six soldiers were killed across the country during the protest, and we commiserate with their families.\u201d",

          "text": "Ahead of the 2023 general elections and the apparent need for women and youths to be actively involved, a Kaduna-based non-governmental organisation (NGO), Legal Awareness for Nigerian Women (LAWN/LEADS) under its six-month \u201cWe-You-PRO\u201d project has organised a three-day workshop for women and youths on how to advocate and lobby for political positions.\n\nThe project being implemented by LANW/LEADS and funded by the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom through ActionAid International Nigeria, was developed to contribute to inclusive and responsive democratic processes and outcomes through citizens-led actions towards the 2023 general elections in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking with journalists on the sidelines of the workshop, which was tagged women and youth-led policy and manifesto dialogue, the project coordinator, Hannatu Ahuwan, said one of the key objectives of the event was to facilitate dialogue towards identifying the issues affecting women and youths participation in political and governance processes in Kaduna State.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cresearch has shown that we have low participation of women and youths in political space and governance \u2013 decision making in general.\n\n\u201cSo, the \u201cWe-You Pro\u201d project is trying to see how we can build support as we move towards another round of politicking in 2023 and see how we can mobilise women and young people coming together to advocate within decision-making space through the political parties, through governance in general.\n\n\u201cIn this particular meeting, we will look at the issues that have been limiting women and youths from participating maximally in governance and come up with realistic solutions to these issues.\n\n\u201cWhen that is done, we hope to come up with a document like the charter of demand which the women and youths will use to mobilise for advocacy, lobbying and campaigns to see how the space can be widened. At the end of the day, participants will develop an action plan which will help them to actualise their aspirations and we hope it will improve their chances of being involved in politics as we approach 2023.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, some of the participants, Hon. Mercy Markus and Comrade Benjamin Bako, said although they have been in politics for a period of time now, the workshop and issues discussed were eye-openers that will help them to be more active politically for better results.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor her part, Hon. Rhoda Giwa, she said the workshop couldn\u2019t have come at a more better time than now that preparations towards the 2023 general elections were in top gear.\n\nAlso sharing her political experience with participants, the current serving and only female lawmaker in the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Hon. Comfort Amwe, urged young aspiring female politicians not to be intimidated by the men but to be focused.\n\nHon. Amwe who has served in various elective and appointive positions, told the participants that politics is all about doggedness, determination and commitment and not for the lilly-livered people or those that easily get discouraged.\n\n\u201cThis LEADS trainings have helped me all along my political pilgrimage and you should not take it for granted. As you are acquiring knowledge to get ready for your political journey, you must be kind to all people irrespective of their status. Respect men very well because they will be there for you when you need their support even when you don\u2019t have money.\n\n\u201cThere was a time my opponent spent more than N100million and I spent just about N2.5million and I won that election leveraging on goodwill. You can see that if it were to be about money, how could I have been able to win? but I was committed and it paid off,\u201d Amwe said.\n\nEarlier, the village head of Kujama, Chikun local government area of the state, Anthony Samari, said: \u201cfor us to have smooth governance in Kaduna State, women and youths must be carried along as seen being done by the current administration in the state.\n\n\u201cTo make this happen, there is the need for a political and legal environment for youths and women participation. For example, the executive arm of government and political parties should adhere to available laws and policies as well as improve on these laws and policies whenever the need arises. We have also noted that finance, cultural norms and religious values are some of the issues hindering women and youths from actively involved in politics. The people in this category need to go for massive lobbying and advocacy to get the buy-ins of all the stakeholders.\u201d\n\nMr. Williams Biya and Paul Onwude who were resource persons took the participants through various sessions and topics during the interractive workshop.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Air Peace will continue to provide jobs, peace to Nigerians, billionaire founder, Allen Onyema",
          "text": "By AZUH AMATUS\n\nWith several solid and well maintained aircraft, one of the newest entrants into Nigeria\u2019s tough and highly competitive aviation industry, Air Peace, has left no one in doubt that it has come to stay and make a huge difference in the sector.\n\nBarrister Allen Ifechukwu Onyema, the amiable and cerebral billionaire Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the wave making airline that began operations with a bang in October 2014, in this exclusive interview with the Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of DAYLIGHT, Azuh Amatus, took us down memory lane on a wide gamut of issues.\n\nThe peace-loving University of Ibadan trained lawyer and founder of the Foundation for Ethnic Harmony in Nigeria (FEHN), in this encounter that held inside his upscale GRA Ikeja, Lagos office, also spoke extensively and passionately about the pains and gains of owing an airline company in Nigeria.\n\nThe philanthropist extraordinaire also bared his mind on why government should abolish multiple taxes in the sector, reasons recapitalisation is not good for the industry, how Air Peace was divinely set up to fulfil a national promise, the importance of safety, challenges and many more. Enjoy the doting father of four in this rare encounter.\n\nYour historic Air Peace is very new and making huge impact in the nation\u2019s highly competitive and tough aviation sector, as the Chairman/CEO, how does that make you feel?\n\nWell, I feel just like any other person who has experienced what you just said. I\u2019m very happy and we give honour and glory to God almighty for the journey so far. We are very happy, it has not been rosy, a lot of hurdles and challenges but we have been able to surmount a great lot of these challenges and hurdles. We are coasting very smoothly and I thank God almighty for not letting His airline go down.\n\nAs a strong stakeholder, do you think government is doing enough to sincerely encourage private sector participation in the nation\u2019s aviation industry?\n\nWell, I might not give you a direct answer, but will give you scenarios. This government has done a lot in improving airports infrastructure nationwide that is one. This same government has also removed import duties on commercial aircrafts acquisitions and this has gone a long way in putting some money back into the pockets of airline owners so they could use that for other things rather than only the acquisition of these aircrafts. Before, after buying your aircrafts you have to pay heavily to get the aircrafts in through import duties. Now government has removed those duties or taxes and it has helped greatly. But there are still a lot of rooms for improvement. One is the multiplicity of taxes from government agencies. We have NCAA, FAAN, NEMA, NAMA, NIMET and all sorts of agencies asking you to pay between 5% and 10% taxes or duties. The multiplicity of taxes has not really helped the airlines in Nigeria. Mind you, the purchasing power of the average Nigerian is very weak, low and that means we cannot charge as much as we would have loved to charge them. So, even the little you charge, the taxes take a lot from your pockets. Government should come in and help us address this issue of multiplicity of taxes in the aviation industry.\n\nAgain, government should also address the issue of foreign exchange. Everything an airline does is computed in dollars. Two, three months ago we were buying dollars at N163/164, now you are buying dollars at N210. So, where you have expatriate pilots or staff, it is like their salaries are doubled. Again, you have to buy spare parts and we do not manufacture them in Nigeria, you have to go out there to buy these spare parts. Now, you need double the money you had before to get these spare parts. Since the dollar issue is so spontaneous, government should come in and see how they can help airline operators cushion the effect of this dollar challenge. Also, a lot of people have been talking about the recapitalisation of airlines. I think some advisers speaking on this subject do not know what it takes to recapitalise airlines. Airlines are not banks and whenever I hear people talking about recapitalisation of airlines in the same mode with banks, I laugh and this is the bane of the development of the aviation sector in Nigeria, where certain people arrogate to themselves the expertise they don\u2019t have and try to advise government in accordance with what they think they know. Some of these advice are borne out of envy and they make it look real. Some are borne out of personal and self centred anger with the aim of scuttling certain person\u2019s achievements. I read in the papers the other day where somebody was saying that to maintain or take an aircraft for C-Check, you need the sum of N500m that is a big lie. I own planes too and I have done C-Checks, it is not up to that. Imagine some people coming out to say that airlines should recapitalise with N5 billion each. Are you going to get the airlines to keep the sum of N5 billion aside? Is that the recapitalisation you are talking about? Airline business is not banking for goodness sake. That is why I said that some people have arrogated to themselves, the expertise they don\u2019t have. Where in the world has such a thing happened, they should come out and tell us. Even Delta airlines, as big as they are with over 800 aircrafts, might not even have such an amount to keep somewhere. I was thinking they will be talking about the acquisition of aircrafts. For example, if you have two aircrafts and one goes bad, you are left with only one and you might get to Abuja that remaining one is snagged. Once that happens your passengers will be disappointed and stranded. Meaning your passengers will be left in the lurch because you have only two aircrafts. But if you have two aircrafts, you have to make sure that one is on standby, so you have to do your operations with one aircraft. You don\u2019t have to schedule your two planes the same time. I might decide to have an airline that plies one destination, you can\u2019t stop me. I don\u2019t need to have N10 billion in one account stashed somewhere all in the name of recapitalisation. I do not want to cover the whole country, I just want to go to Abuja and come back. So, what they should be thinking is, look at the airlines, if you think there capacity can\u2019t cover multiple routes, you make it known that if you have just two aircraft, you should not embark on multiple routes or destinations, so that you will be able to leave one aircraft on ground as a standby for emergency. It is not about keeping N5 billion somewhere. It is only in Nigeria that people talk about this kind of balderdash and painfully, people believe them. Abroad, some of these airlines don\u2019t have a penny in their accounts. They live by financing. I also don\u2019t believe in mergers in this country, I believe in codes sharing. Codes sharing is a situation whereby Medview and Air Peace can come together to code share. It means that may be, we are going to the same route, one day my plane may be snagged and what do I do? I will move my passengers to Medview. Codes sharing is a win-win situation, because the passengers you are moving to Medview, you are also getting a percentage of what they are paying and Medview that has accepted to fly them for you is also getting something. Some other day, it might be the turn of Medview to come to Air Peace, for the same codes sharing. And by so doing, both airlines do not lose anything. We have a lot of arm chair critics and advisers in this country, who know next to nothing and keep advising the government wrongly. I heard one of them saying the other day that Nigerian government should not allow airline operators to bring in planes more than ten years old. Even the 22 years that we are doing, the outside world is laughing at us. It is not about the age, but the maintenance. Obama\u2019s plane, Air Force One was built in the 70s. People don\u2019t always get it right in Nigeria. What government should be doing is to enforce adequate maintenance. Make sure that anybody floating an airline, will first tell the government how they intend maintaining the airline. That is the most important thing that is very critical. Safety is the most important thing in this business and maintenance is very, very important. But these people keep advising government wrongly that people should recapitalise with N5 billion. It is only a fool that will keep such a huge amount of money aside. Such amount of money should be put into the economy to generate jobs. Why tell me to recapitalise when I have equipment worth over N20 billion? What government should do to make sure that the airlines are strong in Nigeria is to provide the enabling environment, remove multiple taxes and look into the issue of aviation fuel. Aviation fuel is very, very high. Almost 50% percent of your cost goes into aviation fuel. They fix their prices and there is nothing you can do about it. When a plane takes off from Lagos to Abuja or any part of the country, it burns a lot of aviation fuel and most people do not know about this. In fact, Nigerians should be grateful to airline owners. Most business men don\u2019t like going into airline operations because it is marred with low or no profits in most cases. It is not a lucrative business; therefore, most people with money don\u2019t go into it. So, when you see people who have decided to create jobs for other people to live, what Nigerians should do is to applaud and help those people stay afloat and not bad mouth, demean and constantly disparaging them without looking at the conditions under which they operate. For somebody to bring out his hard earned money to invest in a business that is not lucrative like airline people should support them. In other countries, they doff their hats for these fearless investors because they are doing humanitarian works for the society. If they are not around, you can\u2019t move from place to place. So instead of disparaging them, help and assist them to serve you better. Government should also come to their aid by making finances available to them. Government can also help by allowing them access a special fund where the interest rate will be a single digit. I learnt government did that some time ago and gave some people intervention fund. I\u2019m aware that so many people that got the fund never applied for it. Sincerely, if such fund is made available again by government I would apply. I will apply because I want to be stronger than I am now. Airlines should be encouraged by all stakeholders and not only government.\n\nDespite the low or sometimes non profit margin in the airline business, you still went ahead to invest your hard-earned billions, what is propelling this passion of yours?\n\nI have said this number of times, in fact, thousand times on why I went into aviation business. I went into aviation to create jobs for the teeming unemployed masses of this country. Someone told me that one commercial plane can give jobs to over 120 people directly or indirectly, so i decided to go into it to create jobs.\n\nSince coming on board fully in October last year, what would you say are the biggest challenges and obstacles facing Air Peace in its daily operations?\n\nWell, I have found myself in an industry that is not like the background where I operate from. I came from the peace building world. I made my money from businesses, part of which is peace building and consultancy. I\u2019m in a different world; they are two different worlds entirely. The people you meet in aviation and those you meet in the peace building community, they are miles apart, in fact, millions of miles apart. In peace building, you have a lot of people with integrity, compassion, passionate and love their colleagues by giving unconditional love at all times and ready to make sacrifices for the good of others. That is not in aviation. In aviation, it is self first, self second, self third and self till one million before considering others. This is something I found in the aviation sector that is shocking to me. Loyalty in the aviation industry is zero and compassion is lacking. It is just about self and self alone. It looks very bizarre when compared with where I was coming from. So, that is my number one disappointment. If I knew the industry is populated by that kind of people, I may not have gone into aviation. May be, I would have looked at other places to go.\n\nDoes that mean you will be shutting down Air Peace soon?\n\nNo. I will not close down Air Peace. I will make people in Air Peace think like me. I will make them buy my vision. In Air Peace, we are trying to do things differently and we are succeeding. I have fantastic staff who are trying to adjust or who have adjusted to my ways of doing things and the way we think. I come from the non violence world and we believe we can transform anybody. The first challenge is the human resources available in the industry. The second is the issue of availability of aviation fuel. One thing is to have the fuel, another is to have the money to buy it. It could be scarce sometimes and that could cause delays in operations. They could also be compromised to sabotage you. I have been sabotaged before over aviation fuel. It was prominent and happened on December 20, last year. It was designed to put Air Peace in bad light. If they had succeeded on December 20, by now Air Peace might have closed down. On that day, we were not given fuel by any marketer and our planes were not flying and our terminal was filled up with people and children were crying until we discovered that one airline had compromised and conspired with the marketers not to sell fuel to us. I ran from my house to the airport and addressed our passengers, gave them food and started pressing my buttons too. And that was when I discovered that the owners of these fuel companies did not know what was happening. Our staff thought there was scarcity, but that was not the case. It was later somebody came to tell us that one airline had compromised this people. We eventually got fuel around 6pm and started flying our passengers at night and were able to move all our passengers that day. If we had carried it over the next morning, there would have been crisis. Mind you, it was a peak period. It was designed to rubbish us, but they did not succeed. Maybe, for us to avert this happening again, government should think of allowing airlines that can afford to bring in their own fuel. If government allows that, I want to assure you that Air Peace can start providing its own fuel with support from the banks. Government should look into this area for us. I\u2019m not interested in the business of aviation fuel marketing, but if I\u2019m going to suffer or get blackmailed with my money, then government should start thinking of allowing any airline that can afford to get its own fuel to do so as to stabilise their operations. These are some of the challenges confronting us in this sector. New airlines like us should be allowed tax holiday for the next three years. Painfully, it is not like that in Nigeria. The other day some people came here and said they were from the tax office and that was irritating to me. It shouldn\u2019t happen. If you do that to me, I will close down this place and throw out over 400 workers here back into the unemployment market. Those 400 people represent over 12,000 Nigerians. If every Nigerian employs 12,000 workers, there won\u2019t be insecurity. So, instead of encouraging people like us, you will see people running around and trying to demean you, bring you down and sometimes praying for your down fall. It is a very wicked country. People do things without thinking of others. If you bring down Allen Onyema, to God be the glory, I cannot starve again in my life, but there are several people that depend on my companies for their daily bread and survival and we must begin to think of those people.\n\nI read somewhere that your dream of establishing an airline began in 1998, but some partners later disappointed you. What spurred you on after those partners withdrew?\n\nI was much younger then and did not know anything about aviation. In fact, I knew next o nothing about aviation in 1998 when these partners came to me with the idea. We were to go into cargo air operations with just one plane, but it did not materialise. But around 2007, somebody told me that one commercial airline can give jobs to about 120 persons directly or indirectly, so I decided I will go into it to create jobs, not to make money. But God almighty will not allow my investments to go down. I\u2019m not in aviation to be richer or amass wealth. If I want to amass wealth, I will leave my equity in the banks. And they will give me good interest rates. That is a good business, no losses. I have been making money since 2005 and leaving money in fixed deposits. But I sincerely believe I could contribute to the well being and development of my nation whether anybody believes it or not. For those who know me, I have done great things for this country and that is one of the prime motives behind floating this airline-to create jobs. Here, our employment policy does not know tribe, religion, race or colour. The place is open; in fact, a Yoruba person is my chief operating officer, Mrs. Oluwatoyin Olajide. I have people from all parts of the country working in Air Peace. Most of these people will tell you that they didn\u2019t know me before coming here. The door is very open for anybody, just come here and prove what you can do and you get. I don\u2019t believe in nepotic tendencies. I want to create jobs for the people in order to fulfil the promise I made to God years ago.\n\nYou once stated publicly that the coming of Air Peace will further promote national peace and cohesion, how is that possible, taking into cognisance the crisis facing our country?\n\nLike I told you my back ground is peace building and I\u2019m the national chairman of the Foundation for Ethnic Harmony in Nigeria (FEHN). I have done a lot for this country. I deserve the highest honour available in this country, just that I\u2019m really unsung because I don\u2019t like blowing my own trumpet. I\u2019m a good example of what you can do for your country and not what your country can do for you. When I moved round this country between 2014 and 2015 preaching ethnic harmony and doing my Nigeria forever project nobody bankrolled me. I funded myself and thousands of followers. We preached broad nationalism as against ethnic nationalism, which we have in Nigeria today. I brought non violence education into this country for the first time, with which I used to transform the Niger Delta ex militants. I started transforming them before the oil companies noticed, took me in and bankrolled me heavily to be doing it for them before the government of late Yaradua and Jonathan now noticed my contributions and supported me also. It was part of what culminated into the amnesty programme; in fact, it was the genesis of that programme. So, I have paid my dues, I could have lost my life in that process while trying to do what the military could not do. I have paid my dues and deserves the highest honour in this country. I did something nobody believed could work. Part of my using Air Peace to bridge the gap and bring about peace and national cohesion can be found in my employment policy. I also own and run ICNPD, International Centre for Nonviolence and Peace Development together with FEHN. We employ people in these places too, but with the airline, I have gone national. I see all my workers as family. Again, I just bought some special jets for Air Peace and want to use them to go to those places most Nigerians find very difficult visiting. We have deployed these jets to Kebbi State. We want to use these jets to further open up those areas planes could not land in the past. We want to see a situation where somebody from Kano can fly to Enugu directly without stopping in Abuja. What we are trying to do is interconnectivity to cities in Nigeria. When somebody from Asaba goes to Sokoto directly his mindset about people there will change directly, but when you stop over in Abuja it becomes different. All these will engender national cohesion. And you could see what we are doing with Kebbi State. Kebbi opened its airport on November 25, last year and as we speak, Air Peace is the only airline flying Kebbi, from Abuja to Kebbi, Kebbi to Abuja. We started with the 36 seater-jets, but have deployed the Boeing now because the jets could no longer carry all our passengers once. This is another of my contributions to Nigeria and I\u2019m doing that at a very huge loss. The government of Kebbi can testify to this. Air Peace is plying Kebbi route at a huge loss, but we are happy for being given the opportunity and we are grateful to the governor, Alhaji Dakingari. A very nice man, he built one of the best airports in the whole of West Africa for the people of Kebbi State. That airport is far better than some international airports on the continent of Africa, you need to go there and see it. Now Nigerians can fly to Kebbi using Air Peace. That is part of my contribution to national unity and cohesion. The governor begged us to do this and told us they don\u2019t have enough money to support us. I agreed because he is a very focused and hard working governor. Despite the huge loss on that route, we are happy and satisfied with the contract because we are contributing to national unity and development.\n\nIn an era where most airline companies are struggling with one or two planes, you started Air Peace with seven solid aircraft in your fleet, how did you achieve such a rare feat?\n\nWell, if you know my history, whenever I want to do anything, I usually plan. I don\u2019t rush into anything. The plan started since 2007. My banks are there to testify. Since 2007, I have been planning, keeping my money and planning for this day. The Americans also helped me. Just like Dr. Bernard Lafayette, who would have been charging me millions to do the non violence programmes with me. The first time he came he said I want to see this Nigerian guy who is very persistent about his nation. Even when they refused me visa to visit US with my staff for trainings, I told them to bring their faculty here for the training. He said he would like to see this persistent Nigerian. He eventually came down. He is the number one non violence trainer in the world and he worked with Dr. Martin Luther King. When he came first, I didn\u2019t pay a penny, they gave me massive support. And when I started paying, I did not pay what others were paying. I also bought five of my planes from one company in the US. I told the man I wanted to help my country with my airline and he said Allen you have won my heart with that statement. He made it clear that it was the first time somebody from Nigeria will be coming to him and putting his country first. He\u2019s name is Douglas Japhet, he is alive. He gave me my five planes at a price nobody in the whole world will give anybody. And that is how God works for me and people get astounded. Then the banks also helped, about two banks helped us with facilities. We are solid.\n\nWhy are most of your aircraft named after your family members, we have Chinonso, Ojochide, Nnenna, Ugochukwu, Helen among others. Why this style and concept?\n\nWell, I believe in family, so much in family, everything starts from the family. If you are going to be a good or bad child, it starts from the family. If we get family virtues right, we may not have armed robbers. We may not have suicide bombers. Growing up, I used to be scared of doing certain things that will embarrass my family or get my parents disappointed. We were brought up that way and I\u2019m proud of my family and have to make them part and parcel of what we are doing. That is why all the planes are bearing names of my late mum, dad, wife and four kids. I\u2019m the only one that does not have any plane bearing my name. I have to start with others. I like satisfying others first before myself. Maybe, God willing, someday when we get more planes, one would bear my names, Ifechukwu or Allen.\n\nHow soon do you intend adding more planes to the already existing ones?\n\nFirst of all, we have to solidify with what we have before we think of adding more fleet. Definitely, everybody wants to grow. We can\u2019t continue running with a fleet of seven aircraft. We believe God almighty will do it someday. When the time comes, we will do it, we are not greedy. I hate debts, I don\u2019t want to go out there and borrow more than I need. If I\u2019m doing between five and seven routes like we are doing now which includes- Port Harcourt, Abuja, Asaba, Enugu, Owerri, Lagos and Birnin Kebbi, let us stabilise our operations first, then some other things will come up. Definitely, Air Peace someday will go international.\n\nHow soon do you intend activating your regional and international routes?\n\nI think I have answered that question, one day when God blesses us, we will do it. When it is God\u2019s time for us to do that it would be done. He is a God of miracles, anything can happen. If God says Air Peace, start going regional next month, we will do it. It is up to God and we look up to Him in everything we do. I\u2019m a fervent believer in God and I have no apologies to anyone for that.\n\nAs a top player in the aviation sector, do you sometimes get scared of competition and competitors?\n\nI don\u2019t get scared by anybody. Some airlines in this country have more than 20 planes; some have between ten and eight. Air Peace has seven and I\u2019m not scared of anybody. I don\u2019t get scared going into things I\u2019m convinced God allows me to do. As long as I can go on my two knees to pray I don\u2019t get scared of anybody. I don\u2019t fear any competition. Competitions for me should be made healthy. If a competition is healthy it will help everybody. The Nigerian flying public deserves more. They should have the best. You will agree with me that the coming of Air Peace has changed a lot in this country in the last three months or 100 days. People from the south east never had it so good before now during Xmas. But this Xmas, all of them were singing alleluia that we came on board. Nobody charged them N45,000, for economy. They didn\u2019t have to pay through the back door to get tickets to fly or climbing over themselves to fly. They didn\u2019t have to fall victims of fraudsters. This time around, Air Peace provided a worthy alternative to them. A lot of people were happy, enjoyed and liked it. So that is competition, it is good. Competition can even grow the market for all of us. Operators do not need to engage in devilish competitions. What we have in the industry now is what I call devilish competition. They de-market one another, wish themselves the worst, it is not good for the industry. Only competition will grow the market, less than one percent of Nigerians are flying in a country of over 170million people. So when they tell you that six million people flew this year, it\u2019s a lie. But the fact is that some of us fly 20 times in a week and you are 20 persons in their estimation. Patronage of airlines in this country is nothing to write home about because a lot of people are scared of flying. In Nigeria, they wait for one airline to have one untoward incident; the other airlines will cash in on it and use it to finish others. They start shouting, we are the only safe one, we are the only this, we are the only that. When you are doing this, you are creating fears in the system, because a lot of people will not even fly yours. A lot of people will be discouraged from flying. When you tell certain stories and know you are lying, it will come back to you. What they should do now is to come together and develop the industry. If we have about five percent of Nigerians flying, every airline will be profitable in Nigeria. We are not scared of competition and ready to compete with anybody. Even if we have only seven planes, we re ready to compete with anybody, because we mind our own business. If you know where you are getting it, just face that place. I don\u2019t have the capacity to cover every airport in this country. I will be stupid to try and do that now with just seven planes. Face that area you can cover and do it properly and you will be okay doing that.\n\nWe would like to know what separates Air Peace from the other airlines operating in Nigeria, those rare or special qualities that stand you out or gives you an edge?\n\nI might be sounding very naive, but that is the truth and it is a fact. For those who don\u2019t believe, Allen Onyema, his family and Air Peace will believe. It is simply God almighty. Sometimes, even me, I used to think that Air Peace has been there for over ten years. We keep forgetting that it is barely ten/twelve weeks. The first flight took off on October 24, 2014. In fact, by last December, we were already thinking we have been there for decades; meanwhile, we were just some weeks old. One of the things that mark us out is our safety requirement. A lot of people think that safety starts and ends with bringing beautiful airplanes or even having a maintenance company like we have. Let me tell you what Air Peace has done. First of all, you must have the right equipment and we have very good planes coming from Germany, London and United States, all coming from known airlines. My jets and planes were all working before we purchased them. I have very good planes. We have four Boeings and three Dornier jets. We have a fleet that has history. Our planes were not picked from the deserts or junkyards. Secondly, the issue of maintenance, we don\u2019t have the manpower yet in Nigeria, local manpower. But then, the world is a global village, Nigerian engineers should aspire to be required and sought after outside Nigeria. We have Philippines all over the world working outside their country; even Ethiopian engineers are working outside their country. Nigerian engineers should do same by being competitive. In as much as Air Peace wants to develop local contents, we must also be mindful of our safety parameters. In Air Peace, it is zero tolerance for unsafe practices. Instead of employing engineers that I as the chairman will be controlling, we decided to go for a maintenance organization. We brought in BCT Aviation Maintenance Company from UK. It is a renowned maintenance company in Britain and they maintain so many airlines in the world because of their track record. Prior to engaging them, I went round the world in search of a very credible and competent maintenance organization. We ended up with BCT at a very huge cost to us. We went for them because we want our safety parameters to be impeccable. We want the safety of the lives and property of our customers to be protected at all times. We cannot buy the lives of our customers. Our safety measures stand us out. From day one when I was seeking my AOC, I made it known to the operators that they should not even cover me the moment they discover we are doing anything wrong. I don\u2019t want anybody to help me cut corners so that we don\u2019t derail, which was why we brought BCT. Another important issue is the flying crew. Who are the people flying your planes? Most of the accidents in aviation are caused by human errors, mostly from the pilots and engineers too. In Air Peace, we employed the best hands available anywhere to command our flight operations. I contacted my banks and told them to be ready to help our operations. Maybe, because of my integrity, Fidelity bank has been very, very supportive. They gave us some loans for operations and I have been with them for several years, maybe, they are repaying back my loyalty. Fidelity I must say again is supporting Air Peace very well. Fidelity support has helped our smooth operations. We don\u2019t cut corners and we have integrity. I\u2019m Air Peace, Air Peace is me. Most banks don\u2019t give loans to airlines, but Fidelity did that for me. A lot of people will tell me that whenever Air Peace lands, it is like dropping a paper on the ground. Except where the weather is extremely bad or where a first officer undergoing training is the one landing, that is the only time. Air Peace boasts of the best pilots in this country and they are all flying our planes. I want anybody or any airline to challenge me on that. It is just only one pilot in one of the airlines that is remaining. We don\u2019t poach pilots, they always come to us willingly because they heard that I think about other people first before myself and they have all seen it. I must thank Captain Victor Egeonu, most of his colleagues respect him and he is a pilot that has penchant for details. He is my chief pilot now and ensures that any pilot coming here is among the best in the country. All the chief pilots in other airlines in this country are currently with Air Peace. And what are we bringing to the table, experience. These are people who have been flying for over two decades without any problem. In Air Peace, we don\u2019t make people with 3000 hours captains, our captains have amassed over 15000 hours of flights command. The experience that abounds in Air Peace is massive. We are new but populated with experienced, tested and trusted hands. Our pilots have paid their dues creditably in the aviation industry, not just anybody.\n\nAgain, our pilots are highly motivated, they are paid well and promptly too, same with our other staff. No salary delays, they receive their salaries every 25th.\n\nMy prayer to God almighty is that it continues like that.\n\nEven if I don\u2019t have anything for myself but still able to cover my costs at the end of the day, then glory to God. Anybody in this industry can tell you that Air Peace is where you can go and have peace. Even inside our planes, passengers always experience peace of mind. Air Peace is constantly in God\u2019s hands and nothing will happen to it. I heard that one big airline\n\nowner said we will fizzle out in the next three months, but that can only happen if God is no longer on the throne. God loves Air Peace and it will continue to do well.\n\nIn your sincere assessment, do you think the NCAA is truly living up to its role as the apex regulatory agency of the aviation industry?\n\nYes of course, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority is doing marvellously well. Our NCAA is one of the best in the world. Without them Nigeria would not have achieved category one. India has not been able to achieve that feat as big as they are. We have done that twice through NCAA. I\u2019m not trying to flatter them, I don\u2019t fear anybody, but they are doing great for the industry. I have told you the areas where I\u2019m angry and bitter. NCAA is working and doing very well.\n\nWith your busy schedule, do you still have enough time to run your peace programme, Foundation for Ethnic Harmony in Nigeria (FEHN)?\n\nRemember I told you earlier that if I had known that the kind of people you find in airline business are not the type you find in peace building, maybe, I may not have gone into it. My busy schedule does not affect the affairs of FEHN, because I have credible staff. We are like a family at FEHN. I don\u2019t even look at their financial books, they know what to do. They are trustworthy and well trained outside our shores. I don\u2019t do anything ad hoc or haphazard. If you want people to give you result, you train them well and motivate them well too. FEHN is me and I\u2019m FEHN. I cannot throw FEHN away because of an airline. FEHN\u2019s kind of work is like God\u2019s calling, it is my own ministry, because when you transform an individual you feel fulfilled. Instead of quitting FEHN, I will close down Air Peace. If I\u2019m to choose between FEHN and Air Peace, I will send Air Peace to the gallows and stick to FEHN. With FEHN, I\u2019m directly touching lives of those who may be dangerous to the society. Moreover, Air Peace cannot give me the kind of money FEHN will give me. That is the truth, I train within and outside this country and paid heavily as a consultant. Whenever I advertise my programmes, people go to banks to pay to be able to attend my conflict management programmes that I handle with my American partners. Conflict management training is not for the dregs of the society or violent people only, no, it is for everybody. I still have contracts with Shell and others. Air Peace can\u2019t do one third of what FEHN is doing for me. Is it not FEHN that produced the money I used in setting up Air Peace?\n\nAs a busy CEO, do you still practice law?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t go the courts again, but I practised so well for 15 years. It was clashing with my peace building efforts so I had to give way. But I still counsel the young ones, my younger one is also a lawyer. I still proffer advice to people freely even though I no longer practice due to my busy schedules.\n\nHow do you also relax?\n\nWell, the truth is that I only relax with my Ipad by working on it. So I don\u2019t relax because when other people are sleeping, I\u2019m awake and my wife is used to the way I work. I love work and go to bed most times, by 3.30am and could wake up before 5.30am, every day. I have done this since 1990. I have stayed till daybreak in this office working. I don\u2019t sleep, I know it is not healthy and I don\u2019t want anybody to emulate me. It makes me agitated sometimes and I have not gone for holidays too per se. I\u2019m always working whenever I go on holidays with m family. I hardly shut down. It is not something good, but I can\u2019t see myself going to bed before 3.am. In fact, I fight sleep because I hate sleep and don\u2019t like sleeping. I used to enjoy watching football, but in the last one year I don\u2019t think I have done that. My team is Tottenham, which I have been supporting since in the 80s as a teenager. I keep myself busy driving, I like driving myself. I like driving my convertibles, because I want to enjoy also and that is the only thing I enjoy. I like convertibles. When I drive my convertibles and play music I become happy. Again, how many hours do I even drive them, may be, 30 minutes to this place? Driving is the only way I recreate.\n\nAs a very fulfilled man, is there anything you still want from God?\n\nOf course, everybody wants something from God. You want God to continue blessing you and to continue forgiving your sins. I\u2019m a Catholic but have nothing against other faiths. A certain percentage of my gross earnings goes to evangelism and I have built churches and donated to different religions.\n\nAs a lover of peace and promoter of ethnic harmony, what is your advice to Nigerians as the general election approaches?\n\nMy advice is that Nigerians, mostly our politicians should remember that we have just one country. We should not allow our country to go the route of other African countries. Everybody must embrace peace. The election must be free and fair. Complaints should be properly addressed. People should not do anything that will be tantamount to rigging the elections. The contestants should be willing to accept victory and defeat respectively. If you know you have lost, willingly throw in the towel by congratulating the winner, this will help douse the tension. The situation where politicians promote violence is unsavoury. They should say no to hate speeches. The contestants should ensure their followers do not take to violence before, during and after the elections. Nigeria cannot develop in a state of rancour, hate and chaos. We can only develop in a state of peace. My advice to them is to play by the rules.\n\nDo you have regrets in life?\n\nWell, do I have any regret? Maybe, the only regret I have, that is not regret but losing my mum at a very young age still hurts. My mum died in 1991 at the age of 44. She died after four days of fever; I was young but had already graduated as a lawyer from UI.\n\nThe only regret I have is not representing this country at the Olympics. I was the sports man of the year in my school in 1984 at Government College Ughelli. As a secondary school student I was doing 10.4 seconds in 100 metres, without training. The guy who was coming a distant fifth Moses Oyiki, later represented Nigeria at the Olympics and people were asking where is Allen Onyema. I was not encouraged by my parents because I was meant to feel like an unserious person within the family, then everybody was shouting education and I happen to be the first son.\n\nPeople in athletics and soccer didn\u2019t go to school then, unlike now that you have graduates going into sports. My greatest regret is not having represented my nation at the Olympics. I would have loved to go to the Olympics and see myself crying with my flag being raised with a gold medal on my neck. And that was the only time I thought they would have played the national anthem for me. I\u2019m not a governor, nor president. I love my country and that is my only regret.\n\nAgain, none of my kids are into sports. My daughter did athletics in secondary school, but she didn\u2019t carry on. The boys are playing football, but not serious with it.\n\nThe only thing they are all doing is law. Ugochukwu is studying abroad for his A-levels.\n\nAs a rich Nigerian do you have the intention of going into politics someday?\n\nIt is not something I have given a thought. A lot of people try to push me. Even years back, some people told me to go into politics and contest for the governor of Anambra State, even the Senate. But I\u2019m not interested. I believe that everybody must not be a president or governor to contribute to nation building. What I did for the Niger Delta is good example of how to contribute to the growth of your nation without vying for any political office. I\u2019m not interested, but if I\u2019m given an appointment, I can come and contribute. I believe I can contribute to the growth of my nation without going into the murky waters of partisan politics. A lot of bigwigs want me in politics because they believe I\u2019m selfless, but I thanked them and also told them to allow me continue contributing from my own angle. You and I know that most good people don\u2019t make it in politics. It is better you have your integrity intact and continue your good works from the outside according to the dictates of the Almighty.\n\nThe rumour is everywhere that Dame Patience Goodluck is the owner of Air Peace that you are just fronting for her. We would like you to clear the air on this rumour once and for all?\n\n(Laughs and adjusts sitting position) I don\u2019t even know Jonathan\u2019s wife and have not even met her. If I see it in any newspaper that Patience Jonathan owns Air Peace, I will go to court. In fact, the newspaper will make my day. The peddlers of such rumours you know them. On one side, some politicians decided to be mischievous. On the other side, some rivals, decided to be mischievous too, believing that if they peddle such rumours a lot of people will not want to fly our planes. But that is a big lie, because people know the truth at all times. Which airline in Nigeria have rumour mongers not ascribed to one person or another? None. As the years went by, people have begun to see that those who came out ab initio as owners, are truly the owners of these airlines and not those people rumour mongers are ascribing ownership to. Every airline in this country was owned by people other than the real owners in the eyes of the public because of rumours like this, which is unfortunate. In Nigeria, is as if people have accepted poverty. They don\u2019t believe that God gave them a lot of powers in their hands. It is just for you to look up to God almighty and find how you can harness it. If you continue denying God\u2019s glory and favour on anybody, you are incurring the wrath of God.\n\nAnd that is why such people will continuously be under because they don\u2019t believe God. It is like you bringing money to help somebody go to school and people are all over the place saying that it wasn\u2019t you that gave that money, but somebody else. How would you feel? They are annoying God with what they are saying. I have paid my dues in this country. I\u2019m waiting for anybody to put it on print or come out and face me instead of speaking in secrecy like cowards. I don\u2019t know Mrs. Jonathan and she does not own Air Peace. I don\u2019t even want to be debunking things like this, because I have talked about it severally. It is not something I want to occupy my time with. I have told you how I came to float Air Peace. Banks that helped me are there. It is not something I want to discuss. Not only Mrs. Jonathan, they have ascribed the ownership of Air Peace to so many people, including the owner of Peace Mass Transit. About seven people have been named as the owners of Air Peace. All these are happening because I don\u2019t like making noise, it is not needed. May be, if I were making noise before, I may not have reached this stage. Distractions will always be there. I don\u2019t know anybody that will own an airline and allow another person to incorporate it with his name, names of his children and family. Who is that foolish patron that will allow you front for him like that? It is sheer stupidity on the part of those peddling such rumour. As long as they do not apologise to God, they will incur the wrath of God and will never know peace in their lives. They will never be able to achieve anything worth talking about in their lives, because they are not happy with another person\u2019s success. One particular airline in this country gathered some journalists and told them to publish lies that Air Peace is owned by Mrs. Jonathan. These journalists started contacting me over the issue. These are rivals that are scared of me, but it does not bother me. I don\u2019t want to lose focus on the real thing. My focus is on the real thing and not on side talks. Beer parlour talks do not perturb me. But I repeat, anybody who does not praise God for Air Peace but sees it as a front, will never, never know peace. If I\u2019m fronting for anybody may I never know peace. If I\u2019m fronting for anybody may God deny me anything good in my life. It is hurtful because they are not praising God and His good works. May I never get it right in anything I do if I\u2019m fronting for anybody. And if not, those peddling this rumour will never see anything good in their lives.\n\nWhat is your dream and vision for Air Peace as well as the legacy you want to leave behind?\n\nWell, I put it up on my bb that Air Peace is the airline that would outlive this generation. Some airlines have been there since 1920s and still flying, this is also my dream for Air Peace. We will be there to continue providing jobs and peace to generation of Nigerians unborn. Air Peace is for peace and national cohesion and that is my conviction, wish and desire.\n\nOnce again, congratulations on your recent chieftaincy title in Mbosi, Ihiala LGA of Anambra State. How does that make you feel?\n\nWell, it is something I had always resisted. I didn\u2019t want to do anything with those chieftaincy issues, but the people felt I should be honoured and my dad also felt I should take it. So I had to respect the wishes of my father and that of the people of Ihiala LGA and accepted. So I feel good that my people have recognised the little good things that I\u2019m doing in our communities and decided to honour me.\n\nFirst published on Daylight in May, 2015.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Air Peace will continue to provide jobs, peace to Nigerians, billionaire founder, Allen Onyema",
          "text": "By AZUH AMATUS\n\nWith several solid and well maintained aircraft, one of the newest entrants into Nigeria\u2019s tough and highly competitive aviation industry, Air Peace, has left no one in doubt that it has come to stay and make a huge difference in the sector.\n\nBarrister Allen Ifechukwu Onyema, the amiable and cerebral billionaire Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the wave making airline that began operations with a bang in October 2014, in this exclusive interview with the Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of DAYLIGHT, Azuh Amatus, took us down memory lane on a wide gamut of issues.\n\nThe peace-loving University of Ibadan trained lawyer and founder of the Foundation for Ethnic Harmony in Nigeria (FEHN), in this encounter that held inside his upscale GRA Ikeja, Lagos office, also spoke extensively and passionately about the pains and gains of owing an airline company in Nigeria.\n\nThe philanthropist extraordinaire also bared his mind on why government should abolish multiple taxes in the sector, reasons recapitalisation is not good for the industry, how Air Peace was divinely set up to fulfil a national promise, the importance of safety, challenges and many more. Enjoy the doting father of four in this rare encounter.\n\nYour historic Air Peace is very new and making huge impact in the nation\u2019s highly competitive and tough aviation sector, as the Chairman/CEO, how does that make you feel?\n\nWell, I feel just like any other person who has experienced what you just said. I\u2019m very happy and we give honour and glory to God almighty for the journey so far. We are very happy, it has not been rosy, a lot of hurdles and challenges but we have been able to surmount a great lot of these challenges and hurdles. We are coasting very smoothly and I thank God almighty for not letting His airline go down.\n\nAs a strong stakeholder, do you think government is doing enough to sincerely encourage private sector participation in the nation\u2019s aviation industry?\n\nWell, I might not give you a direct answer, but will give you scenarios. This government has done a lot in improving airports infrastructure nationwide that is one. This same government has also removed import duties on commercial aircrafts acquisitions and this has gone a long way in putting some money back into the pockets of airline owners so they could use that for other things rather than only the acquisition of these aircrafts. Before, after buying your aircrafts you have to pay heavily to get the aircrafts in through import duties. Now government has removed those duties or taxes and it has helped greatly. But there are still a lot of rooms for improvement. One is the multiplicity of taxes from government agencies. We have NCAA, FAAN, NEMA, NAMA, NIMET and all sorts of agencies asking you to pay between 5% and 10% taxes or duties. The multiplicity of taxes has not really helped the airlines in Nigeria. Mind you, the purchasing power of the average Nigerian is very weak, low and that means we cannot charge as much as we would have loved to charge them. So, even the little you charge, the taxes take a lot from your pockets. Government should come in and help us address this issue of multiplicity of taxes in the aviation industry.\n\nAgain, government should also address the issue of foreign exchange. Everything an airline does is computed in dollars. Two, three months ago we were buying dollars at N163/164, now you are buying dollars at N210. So, where you have expatriate pilots or staff, it is like their salaries are doubled. Again, you have to buy spare parts and we do not manufacture them in Nigeria, you have to go out there to buy these spare parts. Now, you need double the money you had before to get these spare parts. Since the dollar issue is so spontaneous, government should come in and see how they can help airline operators cushion the effect of this dollar challenge. Also, a lot of people have been talking about the recapitalisation of airlines. I think some advisers speaking on this subject do not know what it takes to recapitalise airlines. Airlines are not banks and whenever I hear people talking about recapitalisation of airlines in the same mode with banks, I laugh and this is the bane of the development of the aviation sector in Nigeria, where certain people arrogate to themselves the expertise they don\u2019t have and try to advise government in accordance with what they think they know. Some of these advice are borne out of envy and they make it look real. Some are borne out of personal and self centred anger with the aim of scuttling certain person\u2019s achievements. I read in the papers the other day where somebody was saying that to maintain or take an aircraft for C-Check, you need the sum of N500m that is a big lie. I own planes too and I have done C-Checks, it is not up to that. Imagine some people coming out to say that airlines should recapitalise with N5 billion each. Are you going to get the airlines to keep the sum of N5 billion aside? Is that the recapitalisation you are talking about? Airline business is not banking for goodness sake. That is why I said that some people have arrogated to themselves, the expertise they don\u2019t have. Where in the world has such a thing happened, they should come out and tell us. Even Delta airlines, as big as they are with over 800 aircrafts, might not even have such an amount to keep somewhere. I was thinking they will be talking about the acquisition of aircrafts. For example, if you have two aircrafts and one goes bad, you are left with only one and you might get to Abuja that remaining one is snagged. Once that happens your passengers will be disappointed and stranded. Meaning your passengers will be left in the lurch because you have only two aircrafts. But if you have two aircrafts, you have to make sure that one is on standby, so you have to do your operations with one aircraft. You don\u2019t have to schedule your two planes the same time. I might decide to have an airline that plies one destination, you can\u2019t stop me. I don\u2019t need to have N10 billion in one account stashed somewhere all in the name of recapitalisation. I do not want to cover the whole country, I just want to go to Abuja and come back. So, what they should be thinking is, look at the airlines, if you think there capacity can\u2019t cover multiple routes, you make it known that if you have just two aircraft, you should not embark on multiple routes or destinations, so that you will be able to leave one aircraft on ground as a standby for emergency. It is not about keeping N5 billion somewhere. It is only in Nigeria that people talk about this kind of balderdash and painfully, people believe them. Abroad, some of these airlines don\u2019t have a penny in their accounts. They live by financing. I also don\u2019t believe in mergers in this country, I believe in codes sharing. Codes sharing is a situation whereby Medview and Air Peace can come together to code share. It means that may be, we are going to the same route, one day my plane may be snagged and what do I do? I will move my passengers to Medview. Codes sharing is a win-win situation, because the passengers you are moving to Medview, you are also getting a percentage of what they are paying and Medview that has accepted to fly them for you is also getting something. Some other day, it might be the turn of Medview to come to Air Peace, for the same codes sharing. And by so doing, both airlines do not lose anything. We have a lot of arm chair critics and advisers in this country, who know next to nothing and keep advising the government wrongly. I heard one of them saying the other day that Nigerian government should not allow airline operators to bring in planes more than ten years old. Even the 22 years that we are doing, the outside world is laughing at us. It is not about the age, but the maintenance. Obama\u2019s plane, Air Force One was built in the 70s. People don\u2019t always get it right in Nigeria. What government should be doing is to enforce adequate maintenance. Make sure that anybody floating an airline, will first tell the government how they intend maintaining the airline. That is the most important thing that is very critical. Safety is the most important thing in this business and maintenance is very, very important. But these people keep advising government wrongly that people should recapitalise with N5 billion. It is only a fool that will keep such a huge amount of money aside. Such amount of money should be put into the economy to generate jobs. Why tell me to recapitalise when I have equipment worth over N20 billion? What government should do to make sure that the airlines are strong in Nigeria is to provide the enabling environment, remove multiple taxes and look into the issue of aviation fuel. Aviation fuel is very, very high. Almost 50% percent of your cost goes into aviation fuel. They fix their prices and there is nothing you can do about it. When a plane takes off from Lagos to Abuja or any part of the country, it burns a lot of aviation fuel and most people do not know about this. In fact, Nigerians should be grateful to airline owners. Most business men don\u2019t like going into airline operations because it is marred with low or no profits in most cases. It is not a lucrative business; therefore, most people with money don\u2019t go into it. So, when you see people who have decided to create jobs for other people to live, what Nigerians should do is to applaud and help those people stay afloat and not bad mouth, demean and constantly disparaging them without looking at the conditions under which they operate. For somebody to bring out his hard earned money to invest in a business that is not lucrative like airline people should support them. In other countries, they doff their hats for these fearless investors because they are doing humanitarian works for the society. If they are not around, you can\u2019t move from place to place. So instead of disparaging them, help and assist them to serve you better. Government should also come to their aid by making finances available to them. Government can also help by allowing them access a special fund where the interest rate will be a single digit. I learnt government did that some time ago and gave some people intervention fund. I\u2019m aware that so many people that got the fund never applied for it. Sincerely, if such fund is made available again by government I would apply. I will apply because I want to be stronger than I am now. Airlines should be encouraged by all stakeholders and not only government.\n\nDespite the low or sometimes non profit margin in the airline business, you still went ahead to invest your hard-earned billions, what is propelling this passion of yours?\n\nI have said this number of times, in fact, thousand times on why I went into aviation business. I went into aviation to create jobs for the teeming unemployed masses of this country. Someone told me that one commercial plane can give jobs to over 120 people directly or indirectly, so i decided to go into it to create jobs.\n\nSince coming on board fully in October last year, what would you say are the biggest challenges and obstacles facing Air Peace in its daily operations?\n\nWell, I have found myself in an industry that is not like the background where I operate from. I came from the peace building world. I made my money from businesses, part of which is peace building and consultancy. I\u2019m in a different world; they are two different worlds entirely. The people you meet in aviation and those you meet in the peace building community, they are miles apart, in fact, millions of miles apart. In peace building, you have a lot of people with integrity, compassion, passionate and love their colleagues by giving unconditional love at all times and ready to make sacrifices for the good of others. That is not in aviation. In aviation, it is self first, self second, self third and self till one million before considering others. This is something I found in the aviation sector that is shocking to me. Loyalty in the aviation industry is zero and compassion is lacking. It is just about self and self alone. It looks very bizarre when compared with where I was coming from. So, that is my number one disappointment. If I knew the industry is populated by that kind of people, I may not have gone into aviation. May be, I would have looked at other places to go.\n\nDoes that mean you will be shutting down Air Peace soon?\n\nNo. I will not close down Air Peace. I will make people in Air Peace think like me. I will make them buy my vision. In Air Peace, we are trying to do things differently and we are succeeding. I have fantastic staff who are trying to adjust or who have adjusted to my ways of doing things and the way we think. I come from the non violence world and we believe we can transform anybody. The first challenge is the human resources available in the industry. The second is the issue of availability of aviation fuel. One thing is to have the fuel, another is to have the money to buy it. It could be scarce sometimes and that could cause delays in operations. They could also be compromised to sabotage you. I have been sabotaged before over aviation fuel. It was prominent and happened on December 20, last year. It was designed to put Air Peace in bad light. If they had succeeded on December 20, by now Air Peace might have closed down. On that day, we were not given fuel by any marketer and our planes were not flying and our terminal was filled up with people and children were crying until we discovered that one airline had compromised and conspired with the marketers not to sell fuel to us. I ran from my house to the airport and addressed our passengers, gave them food and started pressing my buttons too. And that was when I discovered that the owners of these fuel companies did not know what was happening. Our staff thought there was scarcity, but that was not the case. It was later somebody came to tell us that one airline had compromised this people. We eventually got fuel around 6pm and started flying our passengers at night and were able to move all our passengers that day. If we had carried it over the next morning, there would have been crisis. Mind you, it was a peak period. It was designed to rubbish us, but they did not succeed. Maybe, for us to avert this happening again, government should think of allowing airlines that can afford to bring in their own fuel. If government allows that, I want to assure you that Air Peace can start providing its own fuel with support from the banks. Government should look into this area for us. I\u2019m not interested in the business of aviation fuel marketing, but if I\u2019m going to suffer or get blackmailed with my money, then government should start thinking of allowing any airline that can afford to get its own fuel to do so as to stabilise their operations. These are some of the challenges confronting us in this sector. New airlines like us should be allowed tax holiday for the next three years. Painfully, it is not like that in Nigeria. The other day some people came here and said they were from the tax office and that was irritating to me. It shouldn\u2019t happen. If you do that to me, I will close down this place and throw out over 400 workers here back into the unemployment market. Those 400 people represent over 12,000 Nigerians. If every Nigerian employs 12,000 workers, there won\u2019t be insecurity. So, instead of encouraging people like us, you will see people running around and trying to demean you, bring you down and sometimes praying for your down fall. It is a very wicked country. People do things without thinking of others. If you bring down Allen Onyema, to God be the glory, I cannot starve again in my life, but there are several people that depend on my companies for their daily bread and survival and we must begin to think of those people.\n\nI read somewhere that your dream of establishing an airline began in 1998, but some partners later disappointed you. What spurred you on after those partners withdrew?\n\nI was much younger then and did not know anything about aviation. In fact, I knew next o nothing about aviation in 1998 when these partners came to me with the idea. We were to go into cargo air operations with just one plane, but it did not materialise. But around 2007, somebody told me that one commercial airline can give jobs to about 120 persons directly or indirectly, so I decided I will go into it to create jobs, not to make money. But God almighty will not allow my investments to go down. I\u2019m not in aviation to be richer or amass wealth. If I want to amass wealth, I will leave my equity in the banks. And they will give me good interest rates. That is a good business, no losses. I have been making money since 2005 and leaving money in fixed deposits. But I sincerely believe I could contribute to the well being and development of my nation whether anybody believes it or not. For those who know me, I have done great things for this country and that is one of the prime motives behind floating this airline-to create jobs. Here, our employment policy does not know tribe, religion, race or colour. The place is open; in fact, a Yoruba person is my chief operating officer, Mrs. Oluwatoyin Olajide. I have people from all parts of the country working in Air Peace. Most of these people will tell you that they didn\u2019t know me before coming here. The door is very open for anybody, just come here and prove what you can do and you get. I don\u2019t believe in nepotic tendencies. I want to create jobs for the people in order to fulfil the promise I made to God years ago.\n\nYou once stated publicly that the coming of Air Peace will further promote national peace and cohesion, how is that possible, taking into cognisance the crisis facing our country?\n\nLike I told you my back ground is peace building and I\u2019m the national chairman of the Foundation for Ethnic Harmony in Nigeria (FEHN). I have done a lot for this country. I deserve the highest honour available in this country, just that I\u2019m really unsung because I don\u2019t like blowing my own trumpet. I\u2019m a good example of what you can do for your country and not what your country can do for you. When I moved round this country between 2014 and 2015 preaching ethnic harmony and doing my Nigeria forever project nobody bankrolled me. I funded myself and thousands of followers. We preached broad nationalism as against ethnic nationalism, which we have in Nigeria today. I brought non violence education into this country for the first time, with which I used to transform the Niger Delta ex militants. I started transforming them before the oil companies noticed, took me in and bankrolled me heavily to be doing it for them before the government of late Yaradua and Jonathan now noticed my contributions and supported me also. It was part of what culminated into the amnesty programme; in fact, it was the genesis of that programme. So, I have paid my dues, I could have lost my life in that process while trying to do what the military could not do. I have paid my dues and deserves the highest honour in this country. I did something nobody believed could work. Part of my using Air Peace to bridge the gap and bring about peace and national cohesion can be found in my employment policy. I also own and run ICNPD, International Centre for Nonviolence and Peace Development together with FEHN. We employ people in these places too, but with the airline, I have gone national. I see all my workers as family. Again, I just bought some special jets for Air Peace and want to use them to go to those places most Nigerians find very difficult visiting. We have deployed these jets to Kebbi State. We want to use these jets to further open up those areas planes could not land in the past. We want to see a situation where somebody from Kano can fly to Enugu directly without stopping in Abuja. What we are trying to do is interconnectivity to cities in Nigeria. When somebody from Asaba goes to Sokoto directly his mindset about people there will change directly, but when you stop over in Abuja it becomes different. All these will engender national cohesion. And you could see what we are doing with Kebbi State. Kebbi opened its airport on November 25, last year and as we speak, Air Peace is the only airline flying Kebbi, from Abuja to Kebbi, Kebbi to Abuja. We started with the 36 seater-jets, but have deployed the Boeing now because the jets could no longer carry all our passengers once. This is another of my contributions to Nigeria and I\u2019m doing that at a very huge loss. The government of Kebbi can testify to this. Air Peace is plying Kebbi route at a huge loss, but we are happy for being given the opportunity and we are grateful to the governor, Alhaji Dakingari. A very nice man, he built one of the best airports in the whole of West Africa for the people of Kebbi State. That airport is far better than some international airports on the continent of Africa, you need to go there and see it. Now Nigerians can fly to Kebbi using Air Peace. That is part of my contribution to national unity and cohesion. The governor begged us to do this and told us they don\u2019t have enough money to support us. I agreed because he is a very focused and hard working governor. Despite the huge loss on that route, we are happy and satisfied with the contract because we are contributing to national unity and development.\n\nIn an era where most airline companies are struggling with one or two planes, you started Air Peace with seven solid aircraft in your fleet, how did you achieve such a rare feat?\n\nWell, if you know my history, whenever I want to do anything, I usually plan. I don\u2019t rush into anything. The plan started since 2007. My banks are there to testify. Since 2007, I have been planning, keeping my money and planning for this day. The Americans also helped me. Just like Dr. Bernard Lafayette, who would have been charging me millions to do the non violence programmes with me. The first time he came he said I want to see this Nigerian guy who is very persistent about his nation. Even when they refused me visa to visit US with my staff for trainings, I told them to bring their faculty here for the training. He said he would like to see this persistent Nigerian. He eventually came down. He is the number one non violence trainer in the world and he worked with Dr. Martin Luther King. When he came first, I didn\u2019t pay a penny, they gave me massive support. And when I started paying, I did not pay what others were paying. I also bought five of my planes from one company in the US. I told the man I wanted to help my country with my airline and he said Allen you have won my heart with that statement. He made it clear that it was the first time somebody from Nigeria will be coming to him and putting his country first. He\u2019s name is Douglas Japhet, he is alive. He gave me my five planes at a price nobody in the whole world will give anybody. And that is how God works for me and people get astounded. Then the banks also helped, about two banks helped us with facilities. We are solid.\n\nWhy are most of your aircraft named after your family members, we have Chinonso, Ojochide, Nnenna, Ugochukwu, Helen among others. Why this style and concept?\n\nWell, I believe in family, so much in family, everything starts from the family. If you are going to be a good or bad child, it starts from the family. If we get family virtues right, we may not have armed robbers. We may not have suicide bombers. Growing up, I used to be scared of doing certain things that will embarrass my family or get my parents disappointed. We were brought up that way and I\u2019m proud of my family and have to make them part and parcel of what we are doing. That is why all the planes are bearing names of my late mum, dad, wife and four kids. I\u2019m the only one that does not have any plane bearing my name. I have to start with others. I like satisfying others first before myself. Maybe, God willing, someday when we get more planes, one would bear my names, Ifechukwu or Allen.\n\nHow soon do you intend adding more planes to the already existing ones?\n\nFirst of all, we have to solidify with what we have before we think of adding more fleet. Definitely, everybody wants to grow. We can\u2019t continue running with a fleet of seven aircraft. We believe God almighty will do it someday. When the time comes, we will do it, we are not greedy. I hate debts, I don\u2019t want to go out there and borrow more than I need. If I\u2019m doing between five and seven routes like we are doing now which includes- Port Harcourt, Abuja, Asaba, Enugu, Owerri, Lagos and Birnin Kebbi, let us stabilise our operations first, then some other things will come up. Definitely, Air Peace someday will go international.\n\nHow soon do you intend activating your regional and international routes?\n\nI think I have answered that question, one day when God blesses us, we will do it. When it is God\u2019s time for us to do that it would be done. He is a God of miracles, anything can happen. If God says Air Peace, start going regional next month, we will do it. It is up to God and we look up to Him in everything we do. I\u2019m a fervent believer in God and I have no apologies to anyone for that.\n\nAs a top player in the aviation sector, do you sometimes get scared of competition and competitors?\n\nI don\u2019t get scared by anybody. Some airlines in this country have more than 20 planes; some have between ten and eight. Air Peace has seven and I\u2019m not scared of anybody. I don\u2019t get scared going into things I\u2019m convinced God allows me to do. As long as I can go on my two knees to pray I don\u2019t get scared of anybody. I don\u2019t fear any competition. Competitions for me should be made healthy. If a competition is healthy it will help everybody. The Nigerian flying public deserves more. They should have the best. You will agree with me that the coming of Air Peace has changed a lot in this country in the last three months or 100 days. People from the south east never had it so good before now during Xmas. But this Xmas, all of them were singing alleluia that we came on board. Nobody charged them N45,000, for economy. They didn\u2019t have to pay through the back door to get tickets to fly or climbing over themselves to fly. They didn\u2019t have to fall victims of fraudsters. This time around, Air Peace provided a worthy alternative to them. A lot of people were happy, enjoyed and liked it. So that is competition, it is good. Competition can even grow the market for all of us. Operators do not need to engage in devilish competitions. What we have in the industry now is what I call devilish competition. They de-market one another, wish themselves the worst, it is not good for the industry. Only competition will grow the market, less than one percent of Nigerians are flying in a country of over 170million people. So when they tell you that six million people flew this year, it\u2019s a lie. But the fact is that some of us fly 20 times in a week and you are 20 persons in their estimation. Patronage of airlines in this country is nothing to write home about because a lot of people are scared of flying. In Nigeria, they wait for one airline to have one untoward incident; the other airlines will cash in on it and use it to finish others. They start shouting, we are the only safe one, we are the only this, we are the only that. When you are doing this, you are creating fears in the system, because a lot of people will not even fly yours. A lot of people will be discouraged from flying. When you tell certain stories and know you are lying, it will come back to you. What they should do now is to come together and develop the industry. If we have about five percent of Nigerians flying, every airline will be profitable in Nigeria. We are not scared of competition and ready to compete with anybody. Even if we have only seven planes, we re ready to compete with anybody, because we mind our own business. If you know where you are getting it, just face that place. I don\u2019t have the capacity to cover every airport in this country. I will be stupid to try and do that now with just seven planes. Face that area you can cover and do it properly and you will be okay doing that.\n\nWe would like to know what separates Air Peace from the other airlines operating in Nigeria, those rare or special qualities that stand you out or gives you an edge?\n\nI might be sounding very naive, but that is the truth and it is a fact. For those who don\u2019t believe, Allen Onyema, his family and Air Peace will believe. It is simply God almighty. Sometimes, even me, I used to think that Air Peace has been there for over ten years. We keep forgetting that it is barely ten/twelve weeks. The first flight took off on October 24, 2014. In fact, by last December, we were already thinking we have been there for decades; meanwhile, we were just some weeks old. One of the things that mark us out is our safety requirement. A lot of people think that safety starts and ends with bringing beautiful airplanes or even having a maintenance company like we have. Let me tell you what Air Peace has done. First of all, you must have the right equipment and we have very good planes coming from Germany, London and United States, all coming from known airlines. My jets and planes were all working before we purchased them. I have very good planes. We have four Boeings and three Dornier jets. We have a fleet that has history. Our planes were not picked from the deserts or junkyards. Secondly, the issue of maintenance, we don\u2019t have the manpower yet in Nigeria, local manpower. But then, the world is a global village, Nigerian engineers should aspire to be required and sought after outside Nigeria. We have Philippines all over the world working outside their country; even Ethiopian engineers are working outside their country. Nigerian engineers should do same by being competitive. In as much as Air Peace wants to develop local contents, we must also be mindful of our safety parameters. In Air Peace, it is zero tolerance for unsafe practices. Instead of employing engineers that I as the chairman will be controlling, we decided to go for a maintenance organization. We brought in BCT Aviation Maintenance Company from UK. It is a renowned maintenance company in Britain and they maintain so many airlines in the world because of their track record. Prior to engaging them, I went round the world in search of a very credible and competent maintenance organization. We ended up with BCT at a very huge cost to us. We went for them because we want our safety parameters to be impeccable. We want the safety of the lives and property of our customers to be protected at all times. We cannot buy the lives of our customers. Our safety measures stand us out. From day one when I was seeking my AOC, I made it known to the operators that they should not even cover me the moment they discover we are doing anything wrong. I don\u2019t want anybody to help me cut corners so that we don\u2019t derail, which was why we brought BCT. Another important issue is the flying crew. Who are the people flying your planes? Most of the accidents in aviation are caused by human errors, mostly from the pilots and engineers too. In Air Peace, we employed the best hands available anywhere to command our flight operations. I contacted my banks and told them to be ready to help our operations. Maybe, because of my integrity, Fidelity bank has been very, very supportive. They gave us some loans for operations and I have been with them for several years, maybe, they are repaying back my loyalty. Fidelity I must say again is supporting Air Peace very well. Fidelity support has helped our smooth operations. We don\u2019t cut corners and we have integrity. I\u2019m Air Peace, Air Peace is me. Most banks don\u2019t give loans to airlines, but Fidelity did that for me. A lot of people will tell me that whenever Air Peace lands, it is like dropping a paper on the ground. Except where the weather is extremely bad or where a first officer undergoing training is the one landing, that is the only time. Air Peace boasts of the best pilots in this country and they are all flying our planes. I want anybody or any airline to challenge me on that. It is just only one pilot in one of the airlines that is remaining. We don\u2019t poach pilots, they always come to us willingly because they heard that I think about other people first before myself and they have all seen it. I must thank Captain Victor Egeonu, most of his colleagues respect him and he is a pilot that has penchant for details. He is my chief pilot now and ensures that any pilot coming here is among the best in the country. All the chief pilots in other airlines in this country are currently with Air Peace. And what are we bringing to the table, experience. These are people who have been flying for over two decades without any problem. In Air Peace, we don\u2019t make people with 3000 hours captains, our captains have amassed over 15000 hours of flights command. The experience that abounds in Air Peace is massive. We are new but populated with experienced, tested and trusted hands. Our pilots have paid their dues creditably in the aviation industry, not just anybody.\n\nAgain, our pilots are highly motivated, they are paid well and promptly too, same with our other staff. No salary delays, they receive their salaries every 25th.\n\nMy prayer to God almighty is that it continues like that.\n\nEven if I don\u2019t have anything for myself but still able to cover my costs at the end of the day, then glory to God. Anybody in this industry can tell you that Air Peace is where you can go and have peace. Even inside our planes, passengers always experience peace of mind. Air Peace is constantly in God\u2019s hands and nothing will happen to it. I heard that one big airline\n\nowner said we will fizzle out in the next three months, but that can only happen if God is no longer on the throne. God loves Air Peace and it will continue to do well.\n\nIn your sincere assessment, do you think the NCAA is truly living up to its role as the apex regulatory agency of the aviation industry?\n\nYes of course, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority is doing marvellously well. Our NCAA is one of the best in the world. Without them Nigeria would not have achieved category one. India has not been able to achieve that feat as big as they are. We have done that twice through NCAA. I\u2019m not trying to flatter them, I don\u2019t fear anybody, but they are doing great for the industry. I have told you the areas where I\u2019m angry and bitter. NCAA is working and doing very well.\n\nWith your busy schedule, do you still have enough time to run your peace programme, Foundation for Ethnic Harmony in Nigeria (FEHN)?\n\nRemember I told you earlier that if I had known that the kind of people you find in airline business are not the type you find in peace building, maybe, I may not have gone into it. My busy schedule does not affect the affairs of FEHN, because I have credible staff. We are like a family at FEHN. I don\u2019t even look at their financial books, they know what to do. They are trustworthy and well trained outside our shores. I don\u2019t do anything ad hoc or haphazard. If you want people to give you result, you train them well and motivate them well too. FEHN is me and I\u2019m FEHN. I cannot throw FEHN away because of an airline. FEHN\u2019s kind of work is like God\u2019s calling, it is my own ministry, because when you transform an individual you feel fulfilled. Instead of quitting FEHN, I will close down Air Peace. If I\u2019m to choose between FEHN and Air Peace, I will send Air Peace to the gallows and stick to FEHN. With FEHN, I\u2019m directly touching lives of those who may be dangerous to the society. Moreover, Air Peace cannot give me the kind of money FEHN will give me. That is the truth, I train within and outside this country and paid heavily as a consultant. Whenever I advertise my programmes, people go to banks to pay to be able to attend my conflict management programmes that I handle with my American partners. Conflict management training is not for the dregs of the society or violent people only, no, it is for everybody. I still have contracts with Shell and others. Air Peace can\u2019t do one third of what FEHN is doing for me. Is it not FEHN that produced the money I used in setting up Air Peace?\n\nAs a busy CEO, do you still practice law?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t go the courts again, but I practised so well for 15 years. It was clashing with my peace building efforts so I had to give way. But I still counsel the young ones, my younger one is also a lawyer. I still proffer advice to people freely even though I no longer practice due to my busy schedules.\n\nHow do you also relax?\n\nWell, the truth is that I only relax with my Ipad by working on it. So I don\u2019t relax because when other people are sleeping, I\u2019m awake and my wife is used to the way I work. I love work and go to bed most times, by 3.30am and could wake up before 5.30am, every day. I have done this since 1990. I have stayed till daybreak in this office working. I don\u2019t sleep, I know it is not healthy and I don\u2019t want anybody to emulate me. It makes me agitated sometimes and I have not gone for holidays too per se. I\u2019m always working whenever I go on holidays with m family. I hardly shut down. It is not something good, but I can\u2019t see myself going to bed before 3.am. In fact, I fight sleep because I hate sleep and don\u2019t like sleeping. I used to enjoy watching football, but in the last one year I don\u2019t think I have done that. My team is Tottenham, which I have been supporting since in the 80s as a teenager. I keep myself busy driving, I like driving myself. I like driving my convertibles, because I want to enjoy also and that is the only thing I enjoy. I like convertibles. When I drive my convertibles and play music I become happy. Again, how many hours do I even drive them, may be, 30 minutes to this place? Driving is the only way I recreate.\n\nAs a very fulfilled man, is there anything you still want from God?\n\nOf course, everybody wants something from God. You want God to continue blessing you and to continue forgiving your sins. I\u2019m a Catholic but have nothing against other faiths. A certain percentage of my gross earnings goes to evangelism and I have built churches and donated to different religions.\n\nAs a lover of peace and promoter of ethnic harmony, what is your advice to Nigerians as the general election approaches?\n\nMy advice is that Nigerians, mostly our politicians should remember that we have just one country. We should not allow our country to go the route of other African countries. Everybody must embrace peace. The election must be free and fair. Complaints should be properly addressed. People should not do anything that will be tantamount to rigging the elections. The contestants should be willing to accept victory and defeat respectively. If you know you have lost, willingly throw in the towel by congratulating the winner, this will help douse the tension. The situation where politicians promote violence is unsavoury. They should say no to hate speeches. The contestants should ensure their followers do not take to violence before, during and after the elections. Nigeria cannot develop in a state of rancour, hate and chaos. We can only develop in a state of peace. My advice to them is to play by the rules.\n\nDo you have regrets in life?\n\nWell, do I have any regret? Maybe, the only regret I have, that is not regret but losing my mum at a very young age still hurts. My mum died in 1991 at the age of 44. She died after four days of fever; I was young but had already graduated as a lawyer from UI.\n\nThe only regret I have is not representing this country at the Olympics. I was the sports man of the year in my school in 1984 at Government College Ughelli. As a secondary school student I was doing 10.4 seconds in 100 metres, without training. The guy who was coming a distant fifth Moses Oyiki, later represented Nigeria at the Olympics and people were asking where is Allen Onyema. I was not encouraged by my parents because I was meant to feel like an unserious person within the family, then everybody was shouting education and I happen to be the first son.\n\nPeople in athletics and soccer didn\u2019t go to school then, unlike now that you have graduates going into sports. My greatest regret is not having represented my nation at the Olympics. I would have loved to go to the Olympics and see myself crying with my flag being raised with a gold medal on my neck. And that was the only time I thought they would have played the national anthem for me. I\u2019m not a governor, nor president. I love my country and that is my only regret.\n\nAgain, none of my kids are into sports. My daughter did athletics in secondary school, but she didn\u2019t carry on. The boys are playing football, but not serious with it.\n\nThe only thing they are all doing is law. Ugochukwu is studying abroad for his A-levels.\n\nAs a rich Nigerian do you have the intention of going into politics someday?\n\nIt is not something I have given a thought. A lot of people try to push me. Even years back, some people told me to go into politics and contest for the governor of Anambra State, even the Senate. But I\u2019m not interested. I believe that everybody must not be a president or governor to contribute to nation building. What I did for the Niger Delta is good example of how to contribute to the growth of your nation without vying for any political office. I\u2019m not interested, but if I\u2019m given an appointment, I can come and contribute. I believe I can contribute to the growth of my nation without going into the murky waters of partisan politics. A lot of bigwigs want me in politics because they believe I\u2019m selfless, but I thanked them and also told them to allow me continue contributing from my own angle. You and I know that most good people don\u2019t make it in politics. It is better you have your integrity intact and continue your good works from the outside according to the dictates of the Almighty.\n\nThe rumour is everywhere that Dame Patience Goodluck is the owner of Air Peace that you are just fronting for her. We would like you to clear the air on this rumour once and for all?\n\n(Laughs and adjusts sitting position) I don\u2019t even know Jonathan\u2019s wife and have not even met her. If I see it in any newspaper that Patience Jonathan owns Air Peace, I will go to court. In fact, the newspaper will make my day. The peddlers of such rumours you know them. On one side, some politicians decided to be mischievous. On the other side, some rivals, decided to be mischievous too, believing that if they peddle such rumours a lot of people will not want to fly our planes. But that is a big lie, because people know the truth at all times. Which airline in Nigeria have rumour mongers not ascribed to one person or another? None. As the years went by, people have begun to see that those who came out ab initio as owners, are truly the owners of these airlines and not those people rumour mongers are ascribing ownership to. Every airline in this country was owned by people other than the real owners in the eyes of the public because of rumours like this, which is unfortunate. In Nigeria, is as if people have accepted poverty. They don\u2019t believe that God gave them a lot of powers in their hands. It is just for you to look up to God almighty and find how you can harness it. If you continue denying God\u2019s glory and favour on anybody, you are incurring the wrath of God.\n\nAnd that is why such people will continuously be under because they don\u2019t believe God. It is like you bringing money to help somebody go to school and people are all over the place saying that it wasn\u2019t you that gave that money, but somebody else. How would you feel? They are annoying God with what they are saying. I have paid my dues in this country. I\u2019m waiting for anybody to put it on print or come out and face me instead of speaking in secrecy like cowards. I don\u2019t know Mrs. Jonathan and she does not own Air Peace. I don\u2019t even want to be debunking things like this, because I have talked about it severally. It is not something I want to occupy my time with. I have told you how I came to float Air Peace. Banks that helped me are there. It is not something I want to discuss. Not only Mrs. Jonathan, they have ascribed the ownership of Air Peace to so many people, including the owner of Peace Mass Transit. About seven people have been named as the owners of Air Peace. All these are happening because I don\u2019t like making noise, it is not needed. May be, if I were making noise before, I may not have reached this stage. Distractions will always be there. I don\u2019t know anybody that will own an airline and allow another person to incorporate it with his name, names of his children and family. Who is that foolish patron that will allow you front for him like that? It is sheer stupidity on the part of those peddling such rumour. As long as they do not apologise to God, they will incur the wrath of God and will never know peace in their lives. They will never be able to achieve anything worth talking about in their lives, because they are not happy with another person\u2019s success. One particular airline in this country gathered some journalists and told them to publish lies that Air Peace is owned by Mrs. Jonathan. These journalists started contacting me over the issue. These are rivals that are scared of me, but it does not bother me. I don\u2019t want to lose focus on the real thing. My focus is on the real thing and not on side talks. Beer parlour talks do not perturb me. But I repeat, anybody who does not praise God for Air Peace but sees it as a front, will never, never know peace. If I\u2019m fronting for anybody may I never know peace. If I\u2019m fronting for anybody may God deny me anything good in my life. It is hurtful because they are not praising God and His good works. May I never get it right in anything I do if I\u2019m fronting for anybody. And if not, those peddling this rumour will never see anything good in their lives.\n\nWhat is your dream and vision for Air Peace as well as the legacy you want to leave behind?\n\nWell, I put it up on my bb that Air Peace is the airline that would outlive this generation. Some airlines have been there since 1920s and still flying, this is also my dream for Air Peace. We will be there to continue providing jobs and peace to generation of Nigerians unborn. Air Peace is for peace and national cohesion and that is my conviction, wish and desire.\n\nOnce again, congratulations on your recent chieftaincy title in Mbosi, Ihiala LGA of Anambra State. How does that make you feel?\n\nWell, it is something I had always resisted. I didn\u2019t want to do anything with those chieftaincy issues, but the people felt I should be honoured and my dad also felt I should take it. So I had to respect the wishes of my father and that of the people of Ihiala LGA and accepted. So I feel good that my people have recognised the little good things that I\u2019m doing in our communities and decided to honour me.\n\nFirst published on Daylight in May, 2015.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Lai Mohammed lists 10 gaps in EndSARS panel report, insists no massacre",
          "text": "Minister of Information Lai Mohammed has thrown the report of the Lagos Judicial Panel into the dustbin, insisting there was no massacre at Lekki Toll Gate.\n\nMohammed said he was out of Nigeria when the report of the EndSARS judicial panel was submitted to the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu last week.\n\nHe has now digested the report and at a press conference in Abuja Tuesday, listed 10 gaping holes in the report:\n\nRead him verbatim:\n\nIt\u2019s no longer news that the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry that investigated cases of police brutality as well as the incident of Oct. 20th, 2020, at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos has submitted its report. The submission happened while I was out of the country on national assignment. Unlike many commentators and analysts, we took our time to read and digest the report, and we are now well placed to respond.\n\nWithout mincing words, let me say that never in the history of any Judicial Panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that are not supported by evidence. What is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of Oct.\n\n20th 2020. It is simply incredible that a Judicial Panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance. Instead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time. That report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob.\n\nWe have read some critical analysis of the report by a courageous few. One commentator, a lawyer, said it raised more questions than answers. Another commentator, a journalist, called it a \u2018disgraceful report by a disgraceful panel\u2019, saying it reported allegations instead of investigating the allegations. Yet another wondered how a Judicial Panel could use the words \u2018massacre in context\u2019 and equate such to a massacre. All these and many more have raised valid questions on that report. We salute their courage and refusal to be cowed by the rampaging lynch mob that has been screaming blue murder since the report was released.\n\nWe do not intend to bore you by rehashing details of the discrepancies, innuendoes, inconsistencies and errors in that report. They are already in the public space. Let us, however, point out some key highlights of such discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc.\n\nThe report threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it. The experts said, inter alia, in their testimony:\n\n\u201dThe Team finds that from the medical data examined, including the\n\ntimeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries\n\nsustained by the Victims, who were taken to the 5 medical facilities,\n\nthat no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at\n\nthe protesters at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the\n\ntimeframe of reference (18.30- 20.34hrs). That the GSW (Gun Shot\n\nWounds) injuries (4 in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were\n\nexamined by the Team, can be safely identified as being discharged by\n\neither low velocity caliber and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms\n\n(artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons). What is however\n\ncertain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military\n\ngrade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have\n\nbeen significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries\n\nrecorded. This was clearly not the case.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which post mortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying nine persons died of gunshot wounds at Lekki!\n\nThe man whose evidence (that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left for dead before he escaped) was found to be crucial by the panel never testified in person. Rather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was\n\nshot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night!\n\nThe panel said trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Toll Gate in the morning of Oct. 21 2020 to clean up bloodstains and other evidence, but still found bullet casings at the same site when it visited on Oct. 30th 2020. It said soldiers picked up bullet casings from Lekki Toll Gate on the night of Oct. 20th 2020, yet claimed that policemen came to the same spot to pick the same bullet casings on Oct. 21st 2020!\n\nThe panel was silent on the family members of those reportedly killed, merely insinuating they were afraid to testify. Even goats have owners who will look for them if they do not return home, not to talk of human beings. Where are the family members\n\nof those who were reportedly killed at Lekki Toll Gate? If the panel is recommending compensation for the families, what are their identities and addresses? Who will receive the compensations when no family members have shown up to date?\n\nHow did a man who reported seeing the lifeless body of his brother himself ended up being on the list of the panel\u2019s deceased persons?\n\nHow can a Judicial Panel convince anyone that the names of some casualties of the Lekki Toll Gate incident listed as numbers 3 (Jide), 42 (Tola) and 43 (Wisdom) are not fictitious names.\n\nWhy did the Judicial Panel feel compelled to concoct a \u201dmassacre in context\u201d as a euphemism for \u201dmassacre\u201d? A massacre is a massacre. What is \u201dmassacre in context?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report never mentioned cases of police personnel who were brutally murdered or the massive destruction of police stations, vehicles, e.t c during the Endsars protest. Does this mean that the panel didn\u2019t consider policemen and women as human beings?\n\nThe report didn\u2019t make any recommendation on the innocent people whose businesses were attacked and destroyed during the protest in Lagos. I think it was too busy looking for evidence to support its conclusion of \u2018massacre in context\u2019.\n\n\n\nIt is clear, from the ongoing, that the report of the panel in circulation cannot be relied upon because its authenticity is in doubt. Besides, the Lagos State Government, being the convening authority, has yet to release any official report to the public.\n\nNeither has the panel done so. The cowardly leakage of an unsigned report to the public is not enough. Assuming the report in circulation bears any iota of genuineness, it is basic knowledge that the report of such a panel is of no force until the convening authority issues a White Paper and Gazette on it. It is therefore too premature for any\n\nperson or entity to seek to castigate the Federal Government and its agencies or officials based on such an unofficial and unvalidated report.\n\nCNN AND OTHERS\n\nThe CNN has been celebrating the leaked report of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry. In its rush to claim vindication, CNN apparently didn\u2019t even read the report before rolling out the drums in celebration. By that action, CNN has celebrated prematurely and has now committed a double faux pas: First, by relying on unverified\n\nsocial media stories and videos to carry out an investigation of the Oct. 20th 2020 incident at Lekki, where it did not have a correspondent on ground. CNN goofed in its report on the findings of the panel, which fell below the main standards of journalism. Secondly, CNN rushed to the air to celebrate an unsigned and unverified report that is riddled with inconsistencies, errors, discrepancies, innuendoes. That\u2019s double faux pas by a news organization that is eager and willing to compromise\n\nstandards just to claim vindication.\n\n\n\nSadly, a section of the Nigerian media has also joined the lynch mob. Honestly, in an attempt to vilify government at all costs, they have done themselves a great disservice. How can any news organization worth its salt write an Editorial validating this kind of report? Are they not seeing what others, including journalists and lawyers, are seeing? In a shocking twist, a Nigerian newspaper chose to hail what it calls \u2018\u2019detailed investigative report\u2019\u2019 by CNN, even when the news channel did not even cover the incident of Oct. 20th 2020! It\u2019s a classic case of cutting your nose to spite your face.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nGentlemen, there is absolutely nothing in the report that is circulating to make us change our stand that there was no massacre at Lekki on Oct. 20th 2020. For us to change our stand, a well-investigated report of the incident that meets all required\n\nstandards and will withstand every scrutiny must be produced and presented to the public. The report in circulation does not meet those requirements. We also appeal to the families of those allegedly killed in Lekki to speak out. It\u2019s untenable to say that some families did not come out because they are afraid. Any parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worth to be called a parent.\n\nWe reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at Lekki on Oct. 20th 2020. That conclusion is not supported by the weight of available evidence. Indictment for murder is a very serious issue that cannot be done on the basis of allegations and corroborations, as the panel did. Such allegations must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the Federal Government and its agencies without foolproof evidence. The Federal Government has never condoned the abuse of the rights of Nigerians by security agencies under any guise, hence it disbanded SARS and encouraged states to set up the panels to investigate reports of human rights abuses allegedly committed by the disbanded SARS personnel\n\nThe 37 policemen and six soldiers who died across the country during the Endsars protest are also Nigerians and should not be forgotten.\n\nThose who have engaged in premature celebration of the report in circulation should now go back and read it thoroughly and tell Nigerians whether it can pass any serious scrutiny.\n\nWe are saddened that anyone died at all during the Endsars protest as the life of every Nigerian and indeed every human is sacrosanct. As we have disclosed many times, 57 civilians, 37 policemen and six soldiers were killed across the country during the protest, and we commiserate with their families.",

We are confident he is the man to take Nigeria forward if you look at what he has been able to achieve both in government and privately,\u201d the source said.\n\nBola Tinubu has remained silent about his interest in the role despite the rumors and speculations.\n\nSeveral organizations, including the South West Agenda for Asiwaju (SWAGA), have instead taken it upon themselves to rally support for Tinubu\u2019s candidacy.\n\nTinubu\u2019s latest moves, which included a visit to Kano State earlier this year, have given his presidential ambitions even more legitimacy.\n\nAccording to observers, the visit was designed at bolstering connections with the north ahead of the next election.\n\nOrji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Abia State, recently paid Tinubu a visit, sparking rumors about his bid to succeed Buhari.\n\nDespite the allure of presidential authority and his influence in Nigeria\u2019s political environment, particularly his role in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s ascent in 2015, many experts say the former Action Congress leader should be a kingmaker rather than a king.",

          "text": "Senate President Ahmad Lawan has said members of the National Assembly have done their job by transmitting the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 to President Muhammadu Buhari to sign it into law.\n\nThe Senate President said this Monday while fielding questions from State House correspondents after a meeting with the president at the State House in Abuja.\n\nThere was a sharp disagreement between members of the National Assembly and state governors over the mode of primaries for different political parties since the Bill was passed by the lawmakers.\n\nBut speaking to journalists in Abuja, Senate President Lawan said the lawmakers and indeed Nigerians were expecting the president to expeditiously assent to the proposed legislation.\n\nAsked how the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) can ensure stability when governors were critical of the direct primary provision in the Bill, Lawan said: \u201cSometimes this kind of disagreements happen. And when they do, I think the best way forward is for people to engage. I always believe, and I\u2019ve canvassed for this, that National Assembly members are major stakeholders, governors of APC are major stakeholders and in fact, the presidency is a major stakeholder, in fact, as the biggest stakeholder because it runs the administration, and our party must always try to bring everybody together. I don\u2019t think there will be any day that you will have a political issue that everybody will say the same thing about it that agrees with you without any amendment.\n\n\u201cSo, when we have any section of a party disagreeing with something, we should be engaging, that\u2019s why we are politicians. We must have that kind of a platform where we discuss the issues, let\u2019s understand each other, and then we make whatever it is that will make this disagreement minimised, or maybe where possible, eliminated completely.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think it is right to say that governors have disagreed. Maybe some governors might have said they don\u2019t like it this way, but that\u2019s normal. So it\u2019s for us to engage and engage and engage. And I believe that.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the National Assembly was willing to let go of the direct primaries if need be, the Senate President said: \u201cThis is not something that we should be talking now because it has passed the legislature and it\u2019s no more with the legislature. So this is something that is now with Mr. President, if we are talking about the electoral amendment bill, the National Assembly has finished its work. And the bill has been transmitted to Mr. President. And I think at this moment, all eyes will be on what happens to the bill from the executive side rather than the legislature.\n\n\u201cYes, of course, when we send a bill to Mr. President, we expect the bill to be signed. But there are two things that can happen. Mr. President could decide to of course, after consultation with his advisers, sign, or if he doesn\u2019t want to sign, he may have his reasons. But I believe that whatever we do in the National Assembly, especially this ninth National Assembly, we think deep, we think wide, we will consult very broadly before we take any position.\n\n\u201cSo, I believe that whatever we send to the executive arm of government, Mr. President for his assent, these are things that are well thought out. And I believe that the expectation of members of National Assembly will be that this bill is signed. But this is then again, not my own calling, it is for Mr. President to take his decision.\u201d\n\nOn Buhari\u2019s response, Lawan said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not supposed to tell you what the President said. Because Mr. President has his spokespeople. So I am neither Femi Adesina nor Garba Shehu. What I can tell you is, amongst other things, because that\u2019s not the only thing, amongst other things, we have discussed this. And my opinion is National Assembly has done its work.\n\n\u201cAnd members of National Assembly have expressed themselves. This is the majority view and is for Mr. President to look at it and of course, expectation of National Assembly is to get the Presidential assent.\u201d\n\nAsked how long he thinks it would take Mr President to assent to the Bill, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why this appears to be the only issue. You see, there is no need for you to lobby for any bill to be signed if you are the chairman of the National Assembly, because you are simply a presiding officer, and you coordinate the views of your colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe majority of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House of Representatives say this is where they want the bill to go. This is the provision they want in Section 52, 3 rather. So I don\u2019t have to come and say Mr. President sign this. Mr. President has his own processes when a bill is sent to him from the National Assembly. I\u2019m sure he has the Attorney General and others to advise him.\n\n\u201cSo, why should I stress myself to say, just sign? We expect that he will sign, but how he does that is his calling. And I think we should allow him to just follow the processes he is used to, but the expectation of members of National Assembly is that the bill is signed.\u201d\n\nAsked if direct primary option was the best way to go in his opinion, the Senate President said: \u201cI don\u2019t have a personal opinion here, because I\u2019m not here alone. So I don\u2019t have a personal opinion. My opinion is that of the National Assembly members.\u201d\n\nParty chieftain hails Gbajabiamila\n\nMeanwhile, an APC chieftain and National President of Northern Conscience for 2023 (NCfor2023), Dr Garus Gololo, has commended Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila for his stance on direct primaries for all political parties ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nGbajabiamila, had in an in interview with State House correspondents few days back, supported the clamour for direct primaries as contained in the 2010 Electoral Act ( Amendment ) Bill 2021 passed by the National Assembly penultimate week.\n\nIn the interview, Gbajabiamila argued that President Buhari was himself, a product of direct primaries because of his popularity saying \u201cthe process opens up the political space for the youths to participate.\u201d\n\nThumbing up Gbajabiamila for his stance on the proposed direct primaries, Gololo at a press briefing in Abuja Monday, admonished those kicking against it particularly state governors, to stop toiling with the wishes of Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe 36 State Governors cannot scuttle the wishes of more than 250 million Nigerians who will benefit from the process.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries will ensure a credible electoral system where the people will choose candidates that are trusted enough to promote the development of the society.\n\n\u201cOur group is poised to pursue the matter to the Supreme Court if need be.\u201d\n\nWhile calling on President Buhari to assent to the Bill, he said, \u201cI assure you that we\u2019ll fight this to the end until relief comes to the Nigerian electorate.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that the #EndSARS report by the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry was riddled with so many errors and inconsistencies.\n\nMr Mohammed said this on Tuesday while addressing a news conference in Abuja. He also described the report circulating online as fake.\n\nReacting to the shooting at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020, the minister said: \u201cWe reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at the Lekki Tollgate\u201d.\n\nHe also asked relatives of the victims to come forward with evidence, saying that \u201cany parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worthy to be called a parent\u201d.\n\nBelow is the full text of his speech.\n\nTEXT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE ADDRESSED BY THE HON. MINISTER OF\n\nINFORMATION AND CULTURE, ALHAJI LAI MOHAMMED, IN ABUJA ON TUESDAY NOV. 23RD 2021 ON THE REPORT OF THE LAGOS STATE JUDICIAL PANEL OF INQUIRY AND RESTITUTION TO INVESTIGATE CASES OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND THE INCIDENT OF OCT. 20TH 2020 AT LEKKI TOLL GATE\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\n2. It\u2019s no longer news that the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry that investigated cases of police brutality as well as the incident of Oct. 20th, 2020, at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos has submitted its report. The submission happened while I was out of the country on national assignment. Unlike many commentators and analysts, we took our time to read and digest the report, and we are now well placed to respond.\n\n3. Without mincing words, let me say that never in the history of any Judicial Panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that are not supported by evidence. What is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of Oct.\n\n20th 2020. It is simply incredible that a Judicial Panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance. Instead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time. That report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob.\n\n4. Gentlemen, we have read some critical analysis of the report by a courageous few. One commentator, a lawyer, said it raised more questions than answers. Another commentator, a journalist, called it a \u2018disgraceful report by a disgraceful panel\u2019, saying it reported allegations instead of investigating the allegations. Yet another wondered how a Judicial Panel could use the words \u2018massacre in context\u2019 and equate such to a massacre. All these and many more have raised valid questions on that report. We salute their courage and refusal to be cowed by the rampaging lynch mob that has been screaming blue murder since the report was released.\n\n5. We do not intend to bore you by rehashing details of the discrepancies, innuendoes, inconsistencies and errors in that report. They are already in the public space. Let us, however, point out some key highlights of such discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc.\n\ni) \u2013 The report threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it. The experts said, inter alia, in their testimony:\n\n\u201dThe Team finds that from the medical data examined, including the\n\ntimeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries\n\nsustained by the Victims, who were taken to the 5 medical facilities,\n\nthat no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at\n\nthe protesters at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the\n\ntimeframe of reference (18.30- 20.34hrs). That the GSW (Gun Shot\n\nWounds) injuries (4 in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were\n\nexamined by the Team, can be safely identified as being discharged by\n\neither low velocity caliber and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms\n\n(artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons). What is however\n\ncertain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military\n\ngrade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have\n\nbeen significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries\n\nrecorded. This was clearly not the case.\u2019\u2019\n\nii) \u2013 The same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which post mortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying nine persons died of gunshot wounds at Lekki!\n\niii) \u2013 The man whose evidence (that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left for dead before he escaped) was found to be crucial by the panel never testified in person. Rather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was shot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night!\n\niv) \u2013 The panel said trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Toll Gate in the morning of Oct. 21 2020 to clean up bloodstains and other evidence, but still found bullet casings at the same site when it visited on Oct. 30th 2020. It said soldiers picked up bullet casings from Lekki Toll Gate on the night of Oct. 20th 2020, yet claimed that policemen came to the same spot to pick the same bullet casings on Oct. 21st 2020!\n\nv) \u2013 The panel was silent on the family members of those reportedly killed, merely insinuating they were afraid to testify. Even goats have owners who will look for them if they do not return home, not to talk of human beings. Where are the family members of those who were reportedly killed at Lekki Toll Gate? If the panel is recommending compensation for the families, what are their identities and addresses? Who will receive the compensations when no family members have shown up to date?\n\nvi) \u2013 How did a man who reported seeing the lifeless body of his brother himself ended up being on the list of the panel\u2019s deceased persons?\n\nvii) \u2013 How can a Judicial Panel convince anyone that the names of some casualties of the Lekki Toll Gate incident listed as numbers 3 (Jide), 42 (Tola) and 43 (Wisdom) are not fictitious names.\n\nviii) \u2013 Why did the Judicial Panel feel compelled to concoct a \u201dmassacre in context\u201d as a euphemism for \u201dmassacre\u201d? A massacre is a massacre. What is \u201dmassacre in context?\u201d\n\nix) \u2013 The report never mentioned cases of police personnel who were brutally murdered or the massive destruction of police stations, vehicles, e.t c during the Endsars protest. Does this mean that the panel didn\u2019t consider policemen and women as human beings?\n\nx) \u2013 The report didn\u2019t make any recommendation on the innocent people whose businesses were attacked and destroyed during the protest in Lagos. I think it was too busy looking for evidence to support its conclusion of \u2018massacre in context\u2019.\n\n6. It is clear, from the ongoing, that the report of the panel in circulation cannot be relied upon because its authenticity is in doubt. Besides, the Lagos State Government, being the convening authority, has yet to release any official report to the public.\n\nNeither has the panel done so. The cowardly leakage of an unsigned report to the public is not enough. Assuming the report in circulation bears any iota of genuineness, it is basic knowledge that the report of such a panel is of no force until the convening authority issues a White Paper and Gazette on it. It is therefore too premature for any person or entity to seek to castigate the Federal Government and its agencies or officials based on such an unofficial and unvalidated report.\n\n7. CNN AND OTHERS\n\nThe CNN has been celebrating the leaked report of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry. In its rush to claim vindication, CNN apparently didn\u2019t even read the report before rolling out the drums in celebration. By that action, CNN has celebrated prematurely and has now committed a double faux pas: First, by relying on unverified social media stories and videos to carry out an investigation of the Oct. 20th 2020 incident at Lekki, where it did not have a correspondent on ground.\n\nCNN goofed in its report on the findings of the panel, which fell below the main standards of journalism. Secondly, CNN rushed to the air to celebrate an unsigned and unverified report that is riddled with inconsistencies, errors, discrepancies, innuendoes. That\u2019s double faux pas by a news organization that is eager and willing to compromise standards just to claim vindication.\n\n8. Sadly, a section of the Nigerian media has also joined the lynch mob. Honestly, in an attempt to vilify government at all costs, they have done themselves a great disservice. How can any news organization worth its salt write an Editorial validating this kind of report? Are they not seeing what others, including journalists and lawyers, are seeing? In a shocking twist, a Nigerian newspaper chose to hail what it calls \u2018\u2019detailed investigative report\u2019\u2019 by CNN, even when the news channel did not even cover the incident of Oct. 20th 2020! It\u2019s a classic case of cutting your nose to spite your face.\n\n9 CONCLUSIONS\n\ni) \u2013 Gentlemen, there is absolutely nothing in the report that is circulating to make us change our stand that there was no massacre at Lekki on Oct. 20th 2020. For us to change our stand, a well-investigated report of the incident that meets all required standards and will withstand every scrutiny must be produced and presented to the public. The report in circulation does not meet those requirements.\n\nWe also appeal to the families of those allegedly killed in Lekki to speak out. It\u2019s untenable to say that some families did not come out because they are afraid. Any parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worth to be called a parent.\n\nii) \u2013 We reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at Lekki on Oct. 20th 2020. That conclusion is not supported by the weight of available evidence. Indictment for murder is a very serious issue that cannot be done on the basis of allegations and corroborations, as the panel did.\n\nSuch allegations must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the Federal Government and its agencies without foolproof evidence. The Federal Government has never condoned the abuse of the rights of Nigerians by security agencies under any guise, hence it disbanded SARS and encouraged states to set up the panels to investigate reports of human rights abuses allegedly committed by the disbanded SARS personnel\n\niii) \u2013 The 37 policemen and six soldiers who died across the country during the Endsars protest are also Nigerians and should not be forgotten.\n\niv) \u2013 Those who have engaged in premature celebration of the report in circulation should now go back and read it thoroughly and tell Nigerians whether it can pass any serious scrutiny.\n\nv) \u2013 We are saddened that anyone died at all during the Endsars protest as the life of every Nigerian and indeed every human is sacrosanct. As we have disclosed many times, 57 civilians, 37 policemen and six soldiers were killed across the country during the protest, and we commiserate with their families.\n\n10) Gentlemen, I thank you for your kind attention. I will now take your questions",

It added that the 46-page ruling made five months later remains confidential.\n\nHowever, the petition made by MRC to the Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday confirms that a ruling was made in the studio\u2019s favour. Mr Spacey and his production companies, M Profitt Productions and Trigger Street Productions, were ordered to pay damages, lawyers fees and court costs.\n\nHe appealed against the decision, but it was denied this month.Mr Spacey\u2019s lawyer has declined to comment to US media.\n\nPublic allegations of sexual misconduct started to be made against Mr Spacey in October 2017, when actor Anthony Rapp claimed sexual advances were made towards him when Mr Rapp was 14.\n\nMr Spacey issued a statement saying he did not remember the encounter, but that he owed Mr Rapp \u201cthe sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour\u201d.\n\nIn the statement, Mr Spacey also revealed he would now live as a gay man. He was criticised for linking his apology for alleged predatory behaviour with his homosexuality.\n\nA string of accusations followed, including that he groped a teenager at a Massachusetts bar in 2016, of which the civil action was eventually dropped, and that he sexually assaulted a massage therapist in Malibu, California. The masseur died in 2019 before his legal action reached court.\n\nMr Spacey lost several acting jobs as a result of the allegations, but made a return to acting this year, with a small role in a low-budget, independent Italian film directed by Franco Nero.",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister says he will lead his country\u2019s army \u201cfrom the battlefront\u201d beginning Tuesday, a dramatic new step in a devastating yearlong war.\n\n\u201cThis is a time when leading a country with martyrdom is needed,\u201d Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said in a statement posted on social media Monday night. With rival Tigray forces moving closer to the capital of Addis Ababa, his government declared a state of emergency earlier this month.\n\nAn estimated tens of thousands of people have been killed in the war between Ethiopian and allied forces and fighters from the country\u2019s northern Tigray region, who long dominated the national government before Abiy took office. The United States and others have warned that Africa\u2019s second-most populous country could fracture and destabilize the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe statement by the prime minister, a former soldier, did not say where exactly he will go Tuesday. His spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s meet at the battlefront,\u201d the 45-year-old prime minister said.\n\nIn response, the spokesman for the Tigray forces Getachew Reda tweeted that \u201cour forces won\u2019t relent on their inexorable advance towards bringing (Abiy\u2019s) chokehold on our people to an end.\u201d The Tigray forces say they are pressuring Ethiopia\u2019s government to lift a months-long blockade of the Tigray region of some 6 million people, but they also want Abiy out of power.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s statement also claimed that the West is trying to defeat Ethiopia, the latest pushback against what his government has described as meddling by the international community. Envoys from the African Union and the U.S. have continued diplomatic efforts in pursuit of a ceasefire to the fighting and talks without preconditions on a political solution.\n\nShortly after Abiy\u2019s announcement, a senior State Department official told reporters the US still believes \u201ca small window of opportunity exists\u201d in the mediation efforts.\n\nIn a year\u2019s time, Abiy\u2019s government has gone from describing the Tigray conflict as a \u201claw enforcement operation\u201d to an \u201cexistential war.\u201d With Ethiopia\u2019s military reportedly weakened in recent months, and with its retreat from Tigray in June, ethnic-based regional forces have been stepping up and Abiy\u2019s government has called on all able citizens to join the fight.\n\nThe prime minister chaired an executive meeting Monday of the ruling Prosperity Party, and Defense Minister Abraham Belay told state media that \u201call security forces will start taking special measures and tactics as of tomorrow.\u201d He declined to elaborate.\n\nAbiy\u2019s announcement brought shock from the man who nominated him for the Nobel, Awol Allo, a senior lecturer in law at Keele University in Britain. \u201cThe announcement is replete with languages of martyrdom and sacrifice,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cThis is so extraordinary and unprecedented, shows how desperate the situation is.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister in his 2019 Nobel acceptance speech spoke passionately about war: \u201cI crawled my way to peace through the dusty trenches of war years ago. \u2026 I witnessed firsthand the ugliness of war in frontline battles. \u2026 War is the epitome of hell for all involved. I know because I have been there and back.\u201d\n\nAbiy was awarded the Nobel for making peace with neighboring Eritrea, on whose border he fought while stationed in the Tigray region.\n\nThe terms of that peace deal have never been made public. Critics of the current conflict allege that the deal was instead an agreement for the two countries to wage war on the Tigray leaders, who were unpopular among many Ethiopians for their repressive 27-year rule despite significant development gains.\n\nEritrean soldiers have been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in the war, even as Abiy denied for months that they were inside Tigray.",
