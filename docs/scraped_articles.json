          "title": "Igangan attack: License Amotekun to bear arms, senator urges FG",
          "text": "Senator Kola Balogun representing Oyo South Senatorial District in the 9th Assembly has appealed to the Federal Government to license the South-West Security Network Agency, also known as Amotekun, to bear arms.\n\nHe stated this on Monday while featuring on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 programme monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nBalogun was reacting to a recent attack by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen at Igangan, in the Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that no fewer than 17 persons were reportedly shot dead when the hoodlum invaded the town on motorcycles around 11pm on Saturday and started killing and destroying property, which continued until around 3am on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking on the programme, the Senator representing the affected area condemned the attack, adding that all hands must be on the deck to ensure there is no repeat of such attack.\n\nBalogun also said the attackers had bigger plans but for the intervention of vigilantes and Amotekun personnel. He, therefore, urged the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, to grant the Amotekun operatives the license to bear sophisticated weapons in order to confront the marauders.\n\nThe senator said, \u201cAmotekun is active and Amotekun is working even with the police. As a matter of fact, the situation would have been worse but for Amotekun and other local security outfits because from the report that I got, the people that came to invade had bigger plans than what happened.\n\n\u201cIt was the community, the Amotekun, the local vigilantes that were mobilised in the middle of the night even though they were ambushed because they were not expecting them but they actually mitigated the effect of the damage.\n\n\u201cSo, Amotekun is working and now the South-West governors said they have a joint patrol of Amotekun outfit across the entire South-West.\n\n\u201cLet me also say that I am aware that the Amotekun personnel have requested that the Inspector-General of Police grant them the license to be well-equipped. As we speak now, they are not as equipped as these invaders who are savages and who go on the rampage.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the IG and the police to grant them (Amotekun personnel) the license to be well-equipped as long as what they are doing is in support of what the police is doing.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming insecurity in the region had forced the six governors of the South-West to inaugurate the security outfit to tackle peculiar security threats in the region. The Amotekun Corps had also got the constitutional backing of the six state assemblies in the region.\n\nThis newspaper had also reported that human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, SAN, said it was suicidal for the operatives of Amotekun to carry on without bearing arms because the criminal elements they were to confront use sophisticated weapons, arguing that if a private citizen can apply for a licence to bear arms for self-defence, the Amotekun Corps are also entitled to the same benefit.",

We don\u2019t joke with him, we know what he has done for us.\n\n\u201cProphet had it in mind that he was coming home, so why would they bury his remains in Lagos? He is from here. Look at these late pastors, Moses Orimolade was brought to Ikare, Ayo Babalola was taken to Ikeji-Arakeji, Pastor Timothy Obadare was taken to Ilesa in Osun state, among others, so why will ours be different?\n\n\u201cIs he from Lagos? So, they shouldn\u2019t get the whole Akoko angry with them because all the Obas in Akoko have been calling me in respect to that.\n\n\u201cSome places in Ondo State had no light for six years but he solved our problems, bought transformers, fixed everything and paid, so it is not only my battle but the whole Akoko.\n\n\u201cAs you can see me, I have not been myself because this is a great loss to me, my family and the whole Akoko and even the world in general.\n\n\u201cThe day he died, he visited me at night. I sat down here in this palace and asked one of the security men if he could hear the noise of crusaders. But moving some steps, the whole noise stopped. I could not believe his death until a reliable source told me his remains had been deposited in the morgue.\n\n\u201cHis visit to me the night of his death signifies that he wants to be buried where he hails from. He had a lot of dreams for the town. He acquired lots of lands here and was building a church and school before he died.\n\n\u201cWhat he told me was that, after 50 years of age, he was going to come back home. He had it in mind to complete that project as soon as possible, meaning he wanted to move his church to Arigidi Akoko.\u201d",

Neither the solo effort of the Executive nor the solo effort of the legislature could deliver the PIB, we better have a cooperative approach where the National Assembly will work with the administration to conceive the Bill through very rigorous consultation and the end of the day we narrowed down our differences and areas of potential conflicts.\n\nALSO READ: TB Joshua: Wound of his passage\u2019ll take time to heal \u2014 Family\n\n\u201cI think we have been able to achieve that significantly. The speed and commitment the National Assembly has shown in working on the PIB and reaching where we are today show that we have chosen the right path.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, our joint committee of both Senate and the House on the PIB are about to conclude writing the report which will be submitted to both chambers of the National Assembly. Our expectation is that we will pass the PIB within this month of June by the grace of God\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila assured operators and stakeholders that the PIB as presently conceived is not intended to drive anyone out of business, noting that rather the National Assembly is working to promote operation in the sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are expected to encourage business whether foreign or local or community-based. But as competing interests juggle and try to elbow each other out, it is the role of the National Assembly to look for a balancing act, bearing in mind that the most important interest for us is that national interest and it is that our national interest that we have that we will look at while considering other competing interests to strike a very delicate balance in this industry\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Where are the police when the bandits started killing our people in Igangan today? Even the palace of Asigangan of Igangan land,Oba Adewuyi Olaoye, was not spared and the monarch, according to reports had been whisked away by the bandits.\n\n\u201cThree days ago,the Director-General of Oyo state Southwest Security Network Amotekun,Gen. Kunle Togun(Retd) raised the alarm that herdsmen had invaded the southwest. I corroborated his statements and called for urgent surveillance across the southwest. Now with the recent onslaught on Igangan people, it is evident that the Fulani herdsmen are on a predetermined mission to kill, maim and decimate the southwest.\n\nThis is one killing too many, I will not fold my arms seeing the blood of innocent people being shed like it is in Igangan.\n\nLamenting the failure of the Federal Government to rise to the security challenges, Adams said now that the North had declared war on the southwest, we will never silent or compromise on the homicide going on in the southwest. I want to charge all the governors in the southwest,as well as the traditional rulers to rise to this occasion.\n\nThe Yoruba generalissimo, however, warned criminal herders to stay away from the region, as the southwest can no longer accommodate killers. OPC and other local security operatives will continue to ensure that the region is safe for residents.\n\n\u201cThose killed in Igangan town have their families and friends, there is blood flowing in their veins, and in a moment their lives were cut short by killer herdsmen and bandits in their home\u201d.\n\nAdams admitted that information at his disposal indicates that bandits and killer herdsmen have invaded the southwest thus pushing the security outfits to the wall. He, however, urged all the governors to beef up the security of their respective states in order to provide adequate security for the people of the region.",

          "text": "\n\nBy: Abayomi Adeshida, Abuja\n\nConstitutional Lawyer and Public Affairs Analyst, Dr. Kayode Ajulo has warned the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Alhaji Abubakar Malami to review a recent pronouncement attributed to him which threatened a legal action against anyone found to use the social media network, Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nAjulo stressed that the need to exercise caution in carrying out a legal action was necessary at this time because it would be an exercise in futility since the offence for which the threat was based was not known to the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nIn a media release well circulated in Abuja on Sunday with the title: LEGALITY OR OTHERWISE OF THE DIRECTIVE TO PROSECUTE VIOLATORS OF TWITTER BAN IN NIGERIA\u201d , Ajulo gave instances of cases that were similar to the matter and attempted to suggest that the Justice Minister should desist from a wild goose chase.\n\nAccording to the lawyer in the statement, \u201cSequel to the temporary ban of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government on Friday, 4th June, 2021, my attention has been drawn to a directive credited to the Attorney General of the Federation for the prosecution of violators of the ban of the blogging company in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to the rationale for the ban of the blogging site, it must be noted that the Nigerian democracy is a constitutional democracy based on the rule of law. Where the rule of law reigns, political expediency ought to be sacrificed on the altar of the rule of law so as to guarantee the continued existence of democratic institutions fashioned to promote social values of liberty, orderly conduct and development.\n\n\u201d The Constitution of a nation is the fons et origo, not only of the jurisprudence but also of the legal system of the nation. It is the beginning and the end of the legal system. In Greek language, it is the alpha and the omega and the barometer with which Government actions are measured.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to the rationale for the ban of the blogging site in Nigeria, it is imperative to note that the provisions of Section 36(12) of the 1999 Constitution are clear to the effect no one shall be prosecuted for an offence not known to Law, Ajulo submitted..\n\nHe went further to state the provision of Section 36 (12) for the sake of emphasis and for avoidance of doubt, and that section reads, \u201d Subject as otherwise provided by this Constitution, a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefore is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a Law of a State, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of a law.\n\n\u201cThe cases of Aoko Vs. Fagbemi (1961) 1 All NLR 400; A.G.F. Vs. Isong (1986) 1QLRN 75 are also quite pungent on this.\n\n\u201d I have carefully spectated the contents of our various penal laws and nowhere is a Citizen of the Country prohibited from receiving or disseminating information which as a right guaranteed under Section 39 of the Constitution,\u201d Ajulo pointed out.\n\nTherefore, he concluded with the following words of advice, \u201cWhile I am weary to believe that the statement credited to the Honourable Attorney General of Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, is with respect, inchoate as the position of law is clear and unambiguous and whatever directive issued for the prosecution of violators of the ban of twitter blog in Nigeria runs contrary to the Letters and the spirit of the Constitution and same anachronistic in a democractic society where rule of law ought to be the guiding compass.",

In Nigeria, Ageing is a growing challenge against the background of accumulated socio-economic hardships, absolute high poverty, poor health facilities and lack of access to education over time.\n\n\u201cWhile taking steps to reduce poverty and ensure inclusiveness of most Nigerians, this administration has recognized the special needs of older persons as active agents of societal development. It is in this connection that the government made conscious efforts to establish the Centre to develop and implement productive activities, social protection and work schemes for senior citizens in order to improve the quality of life of the elderly and ensure a sense of security and a general feeling of health and worthiness extended to them\u201d.\n\nResponding on behalf of the board members, the Chairman, AVM Muhammad Muhammad rtd thanked President Muhammadu Buhari and minister Sadiya Umar Farouq for their support, encouragement and confidence reposed in the members.\n\n\u201cWe are exceedingly delighted to be shouldered with the responsibility of ensuring the provision of welfare and recreation for our senior citizens. These are people who gave their all to this country and in many instances, still working day and night to bequeath a prosperous county for us.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that along with the help and cooperation of such hardworking, honest and experienced colleagues, we will work tirelessly to uplift the progress of the Centre\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, the Permanent Secretary Bashir Nura Alkali promised that the ministry will do everything within its powers to assist the Centre to take off successfully.\n\nMembers of the Governing council of the National Senior Citizens Centre are as follows;\n\n1.

          "text": "From Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nThere appears to be more trouble coming the way of the Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN) Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, as he has been summoned to Abuja for interrogation by operatives of the Department of State Services.\n\nThe operatives who arrived at the ground on Sunday to deliver the letter of invitation did not meet the fiery priest at the church premises. It was also learnt that security guards at the premises refused to accept the letter requesting that the operatives should return on Monday to deliver it to the priest in person.\n\nJust last week, Mbaka returned from a 30-day compulsory prayer retreat imposed on him by the Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga over his recent prophesies.\n\nThis was followed by a letter from the Bishop which stripped Mbaka of total control of the adoration ministry as it was converted to a Chaplaincy. Though Mbaka remained the Chaplain in charge, the Bishop reserved the right to appoint a new Chaplain or his assistants under the new arrangement. Onaga also announced that political statements and prophesies had been banned at the adoration ground.\n\nMbaka\u2019s troubles started recently when he prophesied against the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The cleric had said that God had rejected the President over his inability to provide jobs for youths noting that it was reason for widespread insecurity in the nation.\n\nHe went further to urge the President to resign or be impeached by the national assembly.\n\nReacting to the latest development in his Sunday message, Mbaka queried the rationale behind his invitation, insisting that as a prophet, he will not be cowed into silence. He warned that anyone who was contemplating closing down the ministry would regret such move.\n\n\u201cI got a call on Thursday that the DSS people from Abuja came here (Enugu) with a letter of invitation to Abuja. Over what? What I cannot understand is that the mother church in Nigeria should be \u201ccowed down\u201d to lilliputian.\n\n\u201cThe mother church is both a lamb and lion. The bible says if the foundation is destroyed, what can the just man do.\n\n\u201cAll these are efforts to dumbfound a prophet. All priest can be dumbfounded but no prophet should. We must protect the sheep. In this time, when killings are all over, when there is hunger everywhere, people do not have hope again. The only hope I have is God. Anybody who will stop people from worshipping here will regret it.\n\n\u201cI am the servant here. They don\u2019t understand history. I spoke against Abacha. I went to Minna to tell Babangida what was wrong in his time. I spoke to Obasanjo face to face. I perform under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. I ministered to the late President Yar\u2019adua. I am being used by a supernatural spirit called the Holy Spirit.\n\n\u201cIf they are attacking me here and there, even from those that should save me, no wahala (no problem). The Bible says if God is for us, who can be against us? Only God can be God. I heard the security people did not accept the letter. They asked them to come on Monday to give me the letter. If they know the anointing here is too hot for them, let them change. I will not keep quiet.\n\n\u201cLook at the millions of youths moving about unemployed and you call us Father. Should a father be comfortable in a situation like this? What kind of father is that?\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nBlood flowed freely in Igangan, one of the seven principal towns of Ibarapaland in Oyo State, on Saturday night, as gunmen dispatched over 45 persons to their early graves in the town.\n\nBesides, the five-hour invasion also led to burning of more than 60 houses, while over 160 vehicles were also destroyed, apart from a petrol filling station and the palace of Ashigangan of Igangan, Oba Lasisi Adeoye, that were also razed.\n\nIt was in the same Igangan that angry youths razed the village and vehicles of the Sarkin Fulani of Oyo State, Alhaji Abdulkadir Salihu, in February, this year, after the popular Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho, held a town hall meeting in the town. Salihu was evicted from the town based on allegations of aiding and abeitting killings, kidnapping and destruction of farmland in the area.\n\nImpeccable sources said the invaders stormed Igangan at about 11pm, on Saturday, and operated till 4am, yesterday, before leaving the town in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe bandits, according to sources, were about 50 and they invaded the town on more than 20 motorcycles.\n\nCommunity leaders speak on bloodbath\n\nThe Secretary of Farmers Union in Igangan, Mr Taiwo Adeagbo, said many lives were lost during the invasion, adding that the invaders shot many residents dead, while security agents also neutralised some of the attackers.\n\nThe convener of Igangan Development Advocate, Oladiran Oladokun, said: \u201cOn numerous occasions, Ibrahim, Seriki Saliu\u2019s son kept threatening that Igangan would be razed down to ashes. He had the audacity to proclaim this on social media as well as on radio shows; perhaps, his words were taken as mere groans, but local vigilantes at Igangan kept receiving the news of impending danger.\n\n\u201cThe state, I believe, thought it\u2019s just another hype, for we notified the state of our fears on the 14th of April, when covert information reached us of a meeting of the Fulani, towards fulfilling their oath of allegiance towards reprisals.\n\n\u201cIf we had not made a little cover, perhaps, as Ibarahim, son of Seriki threatened, Igangan would have become a dunghill of ashes; or, perhaps, this is just their beginning.\u201d\n\nA former caretaker chairman of Ibarapa North, where Igangan is located, Tunji Omolewu, stated: \u201dPeople had barely retired to bed when they said they sighted motorcycles entering the town. Before our people could know what was going on, they had started killing people. I got the call around 11pm. We were on our way from Ekiti, where we had gone to do the Yoruba nation rally. I got to Ibadan around 12am, and when the calls did not stop coming, I decided to come home. The palace of our monarch was torched. Adolak filling station, too, was burnt. We are assembled here.\u201d\n\nPolice confirm incident, begin investigation\n\nThe Oyo State Police Command has confirmed the invasion of Igangan in Ibarapa zone of the state by unknown assailants during which many lives and property were destroyed.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer for the command, Mr. Adewale Osifeso, who made the confirmation, yesterday, said the incident began at about 11:10pm, on Saturday.\n\nAsked to comment on the figure of people that were killed during the invasion, Osifeso stated: \u201cCasualty figure would be premised upon the completion of the ongoing comprehensive investigations, please.\u201d\n\nOyo Assembly Speaker, Allaafin condemn attack\n\nMeanwhile, the Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Debo Ogundoyin, who hails from Eruwa, one of the seven principal towns of Ibarapa, has condemned the fresh attack on Igangan, by bandits and suspected criminal herders overnight.\n\nAlso, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, condemned the and call on residents of Igangan and the entire state to be calm.\n\nGovernor Makinde calls for calm\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has appealed to residents of the state to remain calm as security operatives have taken control of the situation in Igangan, where people suspected to be criminal herdsmen killed about 20 persons in the early hours of yesterday.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigeria appears to be at crossroads over the steady rise in oil prices which hit $72 per barrel over the weekend, distorting earlier projections of the World Bank and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which had earlier predicted a low price regime for 2021.\n\nBrent crude, the global oil price benchmark is gradually making a rebound with a barrel of oil likely to hit $75 in the weeks ahead and probably above, a development that signaled a ray of hope for the troubled sector which has battled a low price regime occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic since last year.\n\nIronically, while other oil producing countries with robust refining capacity are anxious to reap the gains of higher oil prices, Nigeria seems to be fretting because a higher price regime will definitely translate to increased cost of refining and higher fuel subsidy.\n\nOn the other hand, gains will be reaped for the country as its 2021 oil price projection was based on an estimate of $40 per barrel, indicating a daily gain of $57.6 daily for the country at 1.8 million barrels of oil production per day.\n\nBut the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, had warned that states might have nothing to share from the FAAC because the country spends about N112 billion monthly subsidizing fuel as a result of the inefficient state of the nation\u2019s refineries which currently is in comatose.\n\nThere was anxiety and panic in the country in April when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had, in a letter to the Accountant General of the Federation , projected that it would deduct N112 billion oil and gas proceeds from the Federation Account for fuel subsidy in order to ensure continuous supply of petroleum products in the country and guarantee energy security\n\nWith daily consumption of petrol at 55 million litres per day and oil at $72 per barrel, the N112 billion monthly subsidy claims may balloon to over N200 billion monthly.\n\nSpeaking in April at the fifth edition of the special ministerial briefings coordinated by the presidential communications team, Kyari said while the actual cost of importation and handling charges of petrol amounted to N234 per litre, the government was selling the product at N162 per litre. That development, according to him, cost the country about N120billion monthly.\n\nWhile pump price steadily rose, the face-off between labour and Federal Government kept the latter in a tight corner. The unions had earlier forced the government to reverse the pump price from N168 per litre last year to N162.",

          "text": "Condolence messages have been pouring in following the demise of Prophet TB Joshua.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari said he would be missed by his followers all over the world not only for his spiritual contributions, but for touching many lives through philanthropic gestures.\n\nAccording to a statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina, Buhari who commiserated with the family and members of SCOAN on the passing of their father and founder, urged them to take solace in the knowledge that life is not measured and defined by chronological longevity, but by enduring legacies and lives touched positively.\n\nThis is as Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, said he received the news of the death with a heavy heart.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu, in a statement by his media aide, Richard Olatunde, said the renowned cleric was a blessing to humanity and a great Ambassador of the state whose ministry was noted for charity.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, Prophet Joshua\u2019s demise came as a rude shock. The pains are not mere emotional flashes; they are indeed piercing. The Ondo State born Pastor and Televangelist was a philanthropist whose exit will be sorely missed by many.\n\n\u201cProphet Joshua was committed to giving and was more often, inexorably imbued with calmness while lifting the downtrodden. As a televangelist, he did not just win souls for Christ, he was passionate about changing lives.\n\n\u201cHe demonstrated timelessly, an alluring service to humanity and compassion by assisting not only his home local government, Akoko North West. Other adjoining local governments in Akoko land benefitted from his large heart of benevolence.\u201d\n\nKogi Governor, Yahaya Bello, said the cleric would be missed for his audacious truth telling and his peaceful advocacies as well as great concern for humanity most especially, widows, orphan and people living with disabilities\n\nWhile he prayed for God to comfort and strengthen the family, church and those greatly hurt by his death, he urged them not to derail for the footprints of the late clergy mostly his humanitarian endeavours\n\nIn his reaction, Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, said he was saddened by the pastor\u2019s death, who he said impacted the lives of millions of people across the world.\n\n\u201cPastor Joshua deployed his gift of delivering the word of God in relatable terms to advance the church of Christ and brought laughter, solace and comfort to many with Christ\u2019s message of love.\u201d\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, in a statement, said the evangelist will be remembered not only for spreading the gospel of Christ, but also for his humanitarian works through which he positively touched millions of lives.\n\nHis death shocking, painful \u2013 Kalu\n\nLamenting the demise of the renowned preacher and evangelist, former Abia governor and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu said Pastor Joshua was popular beyond the shores of Nigeria, adding that he would be greatly missed by his followers.\n\nIn his condolence message, Kalu prayed for eternal rest for the deceased.\n\n\u201cHis death is shocking and painful. He was committed to spreading the gospel of God through his religious and philanthropic platforms. Pastor Joshua was simple, kind-hearted, generous and easy going.\n\n\u201cHe played a key role in human capital development through philanthropy and counselling. His demise has no doubt, left a big vacuum in the Synagogue.\n\n\u201cHowever, the congregation should take solace in the fact that the late clergyman contributed immensely to the growth of the Synagogue church and the larger community by touching lives positively.\n\n\u201cThe late Pastor Joshua will be remembered as a notable spiritual leader with passion for empowering the poor and vulnerable in the society.\u201d\n\nWhile praying for the repose of the soul of the deceased, Kalu extended his condolences to the people and government of Ondo state over the sad loss.\n\nJonathan, Arthur Eze, Gani Adams mourn\n\nFormer president, Goodluck Jonathan, described the late Joshua as a devout man of God, who served God and humanity with relentless passion during his life.\n\nThe former president in a message by Ikechukwu Eze, in Abuja, yesterday, said he impacted millions of lives across Nigeria and the globe.\n\nHe said he was saddened to hear about the death of T.B Joshua, at a young age of 57.\n\n\u201cTB Joshua was a devout man of God who served God and humanity with relentless passion.\n\n\u201cHe was a man of sound doctrine, meek and faithful to his call and passion of reconciling men to God and offering hope to humanity.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian leader, TB Joshua and his ministry exemplified Christ in faith, love and charity; positively impacting the lives of many Nigerians, Africans and millions of people across the world.\n\n\u201cI condole with his family, his church and millions of his followers across the world. May God grant them peace and strength to cope with this loss,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\nThe former president also prayed God to grant millions of Joshua\u2019s followers across the world the strength to cope with his exit.\n\nAcclaimed philanthropist and oil merchant, Prince Arthur Eze, described his death as a global calamity for the entire human race and Christians worldwide.\n\nAccording to Prince Eze, with TB Joshua\u2019s death, Nigeria has lost a precious citizen who stood out as a symbol of national unity and pride.\n\nHe said the death was a big loss to the preaching and spreading of the gospel and entire Christendom world wide.\n\nPrince Arthur Eze said the prophet would be missed by his teeming admirers and followers to whom he dedicated his spiritual powers, healing and delivering them from evil spirits and divers health challenges.\n\nProphet Joshua he said was used to perform a lot of notable healings which immortalised him.\n\nThe philanthropiat described TB Joshua as a humble man of God who the Almighty used to touch many souls in terms of philanthropy and spiritual cleansing.\n\n\u201cIndeed TB Joshua was a religious iroko tree whose life gave succour and salvation to humanity\u201d he lamented.\n\nPrince Arthur Eze prayed for the repose of the soul of Prophet TB Joshua while believing that \u201che is already seated in the right hand of our lord jesus christ.\u201d\n\nPrince Eze however expressed regrets that those whom he was used to cure and were still being healed from different ailments and health problems would miss his ministrations for spiritual freedom and purity.\n\nThe Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has described the death as a rude shock, painful and devastating.\n\nAdams described the late prophet as an \u2018Iroko\u2019 tree and an abode for many.\n\n\u201cT.B. Joshua found favour in spreading the Gospel of God through his ministry.\n\n\u201cAccording to the words of God in the Bible, the Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants, the prophets.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult for me to come to terms with the reality of his death. It was very sad. Prophet T.B. Joshua lived and died for God. His life was a complete definition of God\u2019s generousity and philosophy.\u201d\n\nTerrible loss to Yoruba nation \u2013 Akintoye\n\nIlana Omo Oodua (IOO) said his demise was a loss to the Yoruba nation.\n\nLeader of the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, in a statement by Maxwell Adeleye, said he was a great servant of God with outreaches touching most part of the world and bringing charity to the needy everywhere, including his people in the Akoko Area of Ondo State.\n\n\u201cIn many countries across the world, people watched his ministry on TV as he brought his gospel message with hope and joy. We, his people, will miss him greatly. We all pray that God will accept him into the joy of heaven,\u201d the renowned historian and Second Republic member of the Nigerian Senate said.\n\nIkotun community youths mourn\n\nThe youths in the community were also seen gathered in twos and threes speaking in hushed tones. They wondered what would become of their fate now that the man who brought rapid development to the area was no more.",

          "text": "\u201cEvery person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference\u201d \u2013Section 39 (1) CFRN\n\nDavidson Iriekpen, Nseobong Okon-Ekong, Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nThe federal government has continued to face searing criticisms of its decision to suspend the operation of the American microblogging social network, Twitter, in Nigeria as some Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) yesterday told THISDAY that the action contravened Section 39 (1) of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThey also dismissed the directive of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, to the Federal Director of Public Prosecution, to arrest and prosecute any user of Twitter in defiance of the suspension order, as offensive to Section 36 (12) of the Constitution as altered.\n\nSection 39 (1) stipulates: \u201cEvery person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyers argued that the suspension amounted to a hindrance of the citizens\u2019 right to receive information.\n\nThey further argued that the threat of prosecution by the AGF has no basis in law as it clearly violates Section 36 (12), which states: \u201cSubject as otherwise provided by this Constitution, a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that the offence is defined and the penalty, therefore, is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a law of a state, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of law.\u201d\n\nMalami, had in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu, had directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation to work with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy to ensure speedy prosecution of alleged violators.\n\nBut Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, also described the suspension of Twitter as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nJoining the fray, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives threatened to sue the federal government over the suspension of Twitter operations.\n\nThe lawyers, in separate interviews with THISDAY yesterday, described the action of the government as illegal, null and void and unenforceable.\n\nThey said the suspension in the first place was illegal because it infringed on the fundamental human rights of the citizens.\n\nThe lawyers, citing portions of the law, stated that the government cannot prosecute anyone under a non-existent law.\n\nHuman Rights activists and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Mike Ozekhome, citing decisions from the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, said: \u201cNo citizen of Nigeria can be tried or punished for an alleged offence not created by law.\u201d\n\nOzekhome, who faulted the directive of Malami, warned that the government should \u201cbe ready to build thousands of prisons across all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria so as to accommodate the deluge of \u2018erring\u2019 Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, there must be a statutory provision creating an offence before any person can be convicted for the said offence.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe punishment too must be specifically named in a legislation. The apex court emphatically stated that it is rudimentary and elementary for anybody or persons having something to do with dispensation of justice in this country to know that no citizen can be made to face any criminal trial for an act that is not qualified as an offence not defined or stated (codified) in any law and the punishment thereof prescribed.\n\n\u201cAll the above judicial authorities are crystal clear that neither Malami nor the DPP, nor this government, can prosecute any Twitter user. Using Twitter is not a known crime or written offence.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the National Assembly has not enacted any law banning the use of social media, including Twitter, Ozekhome said the mere verbal pronouncement, declaration, directives or threats by Malami could not amount to a law validly passed by the National Assembly.\n\nChief Godwin Obla (SAN) described the suspension of Twitter as senseless and not legally justiciable because there is no order proscribing Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nObla, who noted that what the federal government did in the first place was to stop telecommunication companies from allowing Twitter to use their platform to operate in Nigeria, said that no Nigerian could be punished for merely using Twitter which according to him is an online means of disseminating information.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is nowhere and I have not seen the order by the Attorney-General proscribing Twitter because there must be an order. Can the federal government on its own have breached the citizens\u2019 right to disseminate and to hold and manage information? The answer is no.\n\n\u201cSo, if a Nigerian citizen is using another IT platform, say, the United States platform, he can disseminate information; it\u2019s a piece of online information, it\u2019s not physical. If my Twitter account is a US Twitter account, I can tweet from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ban does not make sense. It is not legally justiciable. I do not see how it can be enforced, and I don\u2019t see how any citizen can be found guilty of such an offence.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Prof. Konyinsola Ajayi (SAN), wondered when a pronouncement by a mi\n\nnister becomes a law on which citizens could be prosecuted.\n\nHe said for anyone to be arrested and arraigned before a court of law, there must be an offence, adding that in this instance, there is no known law for which a person has disobeyed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any law that says if there is a pronouncement by a minister, it becomes an offence,\u201d he said, explaining: \u201cTo arrest someone there must be an offence, a written offence. There must be a law; you must refer to a law that says anybody that disobeys an order or a statement by the minister is an offence but there is nothing like that, there is definitely no law like that.\u201d\n\nAnother senior lawyer, Chief Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), also stated that there is no known law on which Nigerians could be prosecuted for using Twitter and added that the power to make criminal laws rests with the National Assembly and not the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not aware of any law that has been enacted by the National Assembly. The president cannot enact criminal law, only the National Assembly can do so.\n\n\u201cCriminal laws are not enacted in secrecy; it has to be published before it can be effective.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Chief Joseph Daudu (SAN), said, President Muhammadu Buhari lacked the power to use state institutions to fight personal battles.\n\nDaudu also clarified that the decision of Twitter to suspend Buhari\u2019s personal account \u201cis not a matter between Nigeria and the social networking service.\u201d\n\nHe made this clarification in his response to THISDAY\u2019s inquiries on the constitutionality of the federal government\u2019s decision to suspend Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria.\n\nDaudu said every Nigerian operating a Twitter account \u201cdoes so in his own name, even if the underlying objective is to promote the objectives and aspirations of his constituency, business outfit or even office.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said Buhari, though a very eminent personality \u201cis an individual customer of Twitter with no greater rights than the other millions of persons who have also subscribed to Twitter and agreed to their rules and conditions of membership.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter perceived that Buhari broke its rules and applying one of the sanctions open to it removed the offending tweet. Whether the account was blocked or suspended is really not the issue at this point in time,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, therefore, said the president lacked the power to use state apparatus and institutions \u201cto hit or get back at Twitter, which is what he has done in retaliation by banning them from Nigeria using state institutions such as the NBC and the NCC to deprive all Nigerians of their access to Twitter.\u201d\n\nMr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN) also stated that before anyone could be punished for any offence in Nigeria, the offence must be defined and the punishment thereof must be prescribed in a written law.\n\n\u201cThis is what is stipulated by Section 36(12) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that except there is an existing law that proscribes the usage of the Twitter account, \u201cit is unconstitutional to arrest let alone prosecute anyone for using Twitter\u2019s services in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, also told THISDAY that the parliament is currently looking into the recent suspension of Twitter by the federal government, with a view of getting a critical analysis before taking a position on the trending issue.\n\nKalu said: \u201dThe House is busy looking into the trending Twitter issue as expected for any federal parliament. It is time for an in-depth critical analysis of the entire picture not yet time for press releases on the issue. But be rest assured, it won\u2019t be long before we make our position known in line with our laws and democratic principles.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer and former National Secretary of the Labour Party, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, condemned the attempt to prosecute violators of the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nAjulo opposed Malami\u2019s position, saying: \u201cWithout prejudice to the rationale for the ban of the blogging site in Nigeria, it is imperative to note that the provisions of Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution are clear to the effect no one shall be prosecuted for an offence not known to law.\n\n\u201cI have carefully stated the contents of our various penal laws and nowhere is a citizen of the country prohibited from receiving or disseminating information, which is a right guaranteed under Section 39 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOrtom described the suspension of Twitter operations in the country as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nThe governor said the Twitter suspension offered no solution to any of the problems facing the country, as the move was only capable of heightening tensions and fuelling suspicions among Nigerians over the real motives of the federal government.\n\nOrtom, in a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, said that suspending Twitter amounted to suppressing freedom of expression, gagging social media and undermining fundamental human rights of Nigerians, a development contravening Chapter four of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nOrtom emphasised the need for the federal government to listen to the views and yearnings of the people to enable it to address the challenges confronting the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives has threatened to sue the federal government in court over the suspension of Twitter operations in the country.\n\nIt described the decision as an act of desperation of a non-performing and failed government to intimidate and cow the citizens to consolidate its hold on power by brute force.\n\nThe Leader of the caucus, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement yesterday, said Twitter had become an integral component of the citizens\u2019 ability to keep the government in check and to provide real-time feedback on the impact of the government\u2019s activities on the citizenry.\n\nPDP: APC behind Twitter Suspension, Moves to Suppress Nigerians\n\nThe PDP has accused the National Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP said facts available to it showed how APC leaders at one of their party\u2019s national caucus meetings recommended the regulation of social media in Nigeria and how they have been plotting to obliterate internet-based interaction platforms such as Twitter.\n\nThe PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the APC Caucus had been pushing bills in the National Assembly, particularly in November 2020, seeking to enforce a draconian regulation of social media so as to gag Nigerians from exposing its atrocities, including human right abuses, treasury looting, nepotism and sectional marginalisation by the APC administration.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cNigerians can also recall how the APC administration in carrying out the agenda of its party has been using the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to suffocate the media space with humongous fines and threats of suspension of operating licences of broadcast stations.\u201d\n\nBuhari: We Are Taking the Lead in Cyber Policing\n\nProtocols:\n\n1. It is with great pleasure that I address you today on this occasion of the 2019 Annual Investment Meeting here in Dubai.\n\n2. I wish to thank His Royal Highness, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates, for inviting me to speak at this event.\n\n3. This is the ninth edition of such a gathering. At this point, I want to congratulate His Highness, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum for his vision to support such a platform where world leaders in both the public and private sectors exchange ideas on how to make this world a better place.\n\n4. This morning, my brief remarks will be on digital globalisation, which we all agree is transforming the world as we know it. Almost every day, innovations and transformative ideas are rolled out. This trend is here to stay.\n\n5. Today, we have a cyber world that is intangible but real. This borderless world is powerful, and it impacts the lives of billions of people, no matter how remote their physical locations are.\n\n6. People work in it. People socialise in it. And people invest in it. This presents enormous opportunities. But it also remains a constant threat if left unregulated.\n\n7. On the one hand, it has made the human race more productive and more efficient. Today, we have digital banking, virtual currencies and many social platforms that connect people and cultures.\n\n8. On the other hand, we have seen platforms hijacked and manipulated as evidenced by the steady rise in fake news and cybercrimes.\n\n9. More recently, we are also witnessing the use of the cyber space to manipulate elections, subvert the democratic rights of citizens as well as propagate violence.\n\n10. In effect, the digital world has become the new frontier for both good and evil. Therefore, the challenge for world leaders must be to ensure that this space is inclusive, accessible and safe.\n\n11. In Nigeria, our mobile phone penetration exceeds eighty per cent. This means majority of Nigeria\u2019s one hundred and ninety million citizens are fully connected to this new digital world; especially our youth.\n\n12. Sixty five percent or one hundred and seventeen million Nigerians are under the age of 25 years. These bright minds are the drivers of this emerging digital sector.\n\n13. Today, Nigeria has close to ninety technology hubs and every day, new ones are coming up and they are all developing solutions for Nigerian, and indeed global problems.\n\n14. Already, these young entrepreneurs have attracted investments of over one hundred million dollars. A sizeable amount from overseas including Silicon Valley.\n\n15. As many of you from this region are aware, Nigerian start-ups always have a very impressive outing at the Gulf Information Technology Exhibition (GITEX). Many have won prizes.\n\n16. As leaders, it is therefore our responsibility to create the enabling environment for these minds to flourish and reach their full potential.\n\n17. When we came in 2015, we immediately agreed that any future economic growth must be inclusive.\n\n18. As the Nigerian youth population are fully digitalised, it is clear that the idea of having an inclusive economy cannot be achieved without digital inclusion.\n\n19. We therefore leveraged and supported digital platforms in our numerous socio-economic programs: from training extension workers in agriculture, health and education sectors; to enabling micro-credits to increase financial inclusion.\n\n20. However, whilst this digital globalisation has occurred rapidly in the private sector, many governments and regulators have not kept pace.\n\n21. New waves of cybercrime and terrorism continue to threaten the positive strides being made.\n\n22. On cyber security, Nigeria has taken the lead in cyber policing in West Africa. In this, we are working with our regional and global partners.\n\n23. Furthermore, our public sector reform programs focus on digitising key operations. From procurement to payroll to revenue collections, we are using digital platforms to reinforce our objectives of improving efficiency, accountability and transparency in governance.\n\n24. We are also working on creating the largest digital database in Africa. Already, our digital identity system has captured over thirty million Nigerians and legal residents.\n\n25. As earlier observed, the digital world is borderless. In many instances, the criminals in this world are faceless and without physical addresses. This is why we must all come together to protect the good while eliminating the bad.\n\n26. Emerging threats are difficult to prevent or manage unilaterally. It has to be a collective effort, led by both public and private sector leaders \u2013 many of whom are here today.\n\n27. A certain level of regulation is needed to preserve the integrity of the digital economy.\n\n28. I therefore would ask all of us here present, over the coming days, to put our heads together and come up with proposals on how we create a digital world that is accessible, inclusive and safe.\n\n29. I thank you for listening and wish you very successful deliberations.\n\n\u2022Being the text of keynote speech delivered by President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Annual Investment Meeting in Dubai, UAE, on April 8, 2019\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Stakeholders demand legal backing for proscription\n\nAdibe Emenyonu in Benin City, James Sowole in Akure, Bassey Inyang in Calabar, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Sylvester Idowu in Warri, Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti and Amby Uneze in Owerri\n\nDespite the ban on open grazing of cattle by Southern governors, the practice has continued to flourish in the 17 states of the region with stakeholders asking for legal backing for the proscription order.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigations at the weekend showed that the delay by the governors in enacting laws in their states to legalise the ban has heightened concerns among residents, particularly in the farming communities of the states.\n\nWith the absence of the law, according to THISDAY\u2019s investigations, herders have continued to openly graze their cattle, leading in some cases to frequent clashes between them and farmers whose farmlands suffer devastation due to the movement of the animals.\n\nThe governors, under the aegis of the Southern Nigeria Governors Forum (SNGF), rising from a meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, on May 11, had, among others announced a ban on open grazing to check the escalating conflict between farmers and herders.\n\nHowever, their decision had riled the federal government with President Muhammadu Buhari querying the legality of the ban.\n\nIn Ondo State, THISDAY gathered that the Bill against Open Grazing and other Matters Related has passed through the second reading but the lawmakers couldn\u2019t go further in the legislative process due to the ongoing strike by parliamentary workers.\n\nBut open grazing by herders has reduced drastically in the state, particularly in places close to urban areas.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the herders still move their cows in many villages like Osi, Ogbese, Ala, Igbatoro, Eleyowo and other villages in Akure North Local Government Area.\n\nAlso, sources told THISDAY that the practice is still going on in villages in Ondo North but not with the impunity earlier displayed by herders.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Commander of the Ondo State Security Network, Amotekun, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said open grazing had reduced in the state as the security agency no longer give them chances to continue the illegal practice.\n\nHe said: \u201cHowever, thinking that we would not have some herders still engaging in open grazing in view of the ban and the operation of Amotekun is like saying why do we still have crime when there are policemen working?\n\n\u201cOndo State Government through Amotekun is not relenting. The herders know they are doing the wrong thing. Once they see us, they run away. They know they are doing the wrong thing destroying some people\u2019s means of livelihood for yours to thrive, we see it as being unfair.\n\n\u201cThe position of government is very clear about it. No open grazing is no open grazing, and anybody that is engaging in it is doing illegal thing and anybody that is caught, will face the full wrath of the law.\u201d\n\nIn Cross River State, the herders were still practising open grazing as usual in some communities in Odukpani, Obanliku, Yala, Yakurr, and Obubra Local Government Areas.\n\nHowever, THISDAY gathered that there have been no clashes between the herders and any of the communities since the cows are restricted to the areas where they have been grazing for decades.\n\n\u201cThe owners of the cows pay rent to the community for the space the cows are taken to feed in the bush along Calabar-Itu highway. That is how we have been operating with them for years, and there is no problem; we have never heard problems,\u201d a community leader from Okoyong confided in THISDAY.\n\nHowever, the state government is insisting that it will not go it alone, but would wait for the southern governors to work out modalities on the way forward.\n\nPress Secretary to the Cross River State Governor, Mr. Christian Ita, said grazing in restricted area was not strange to the state having established the first cattle ranch in Nigeria; the Obudu Cattle Ranch Resort.\n\n\u201cAs I said, I am sure modalities would be worked out at the Southern governors\u2019 level, and then we proceed from there,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Anambra State, despite the ban on open grazing, herdsmen still graze cattle in communities in the state, even within the state capital territory, in open fields and on farms belonging to farmers.\n\nMr. Fredrick Okoye, a farmer in Umuokpu community, Awka South Local Government Area, told THISDAY that despite the ban on open grazing, Fulani herdsmen still graze their cattle on their farms, damaging their crops daily.\n\n\u201cThere is a law which states that if Fulani people destroy your crop, they will pay you for it, and if farmers kill cattle, the farmer will pay for it. But to tell you the truth, that arrangement has not been working. If they (herders) destroy your farm, they don\u2019t pay. If you kill their cattle, they also do not even report for payment, rather, they think of a reprisal.\n\n\u201cThat is the major reason we are afraid. They graze on our fields everyday, even today. If you come to Umuokpu today and wait until afternoon, you will see them,\u201d Okoye said.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Okpuno and Mgbakwu communities, all around the state capital, cattle were seen in the area, grazing in open fields.\n\nThere have been cases of clashes between herdsmen and farmers in Anaku, Omor and even in riverrine parts of Anambra State.\n\nAnambra State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C. Don Adinuba, said the anti-open grazing law was unnecessary as the proclamation of the ban by the governors was enough for the herders to comply.\n\nThe Speaker, Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Marcus Onobu, also told THISDAY that the persistent open grazing of cattle in the state was due to the inability of the state government to come up with legislation against it.\n\nOnobus said Governor Godwin Obaseki was yet to come up with a bill to legalise open grazing.\n\nHe added that though a private bill against open grazing exists, the legislature was yet to debate it because it requires public hearing.\n\n\u201cBut I think the major problem is the strike action by legislative workers because already, we have a private bill before us.\n\n\u201cEven if we want to rely on the private bill without waiting for the governor, we are still going to have a public hearing, and we cannot do that since the legislative workers\u2019 strike has not been called off,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, without a legislation, it will be difficult to enforce the ban on open grazing as verbal pronouncement is not enough because aggrieved persons can go to court to seek redress.\n\nIn Delta State, open grazing persists in the forest, particularly in Ughelli, Abraka, Oghara in Delta South and Central Senatorial zones.\n\nHowever, security arrangement and agitations by the people have reduced open grazing.\n\nMr. Olisa Ifeajika, Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, confirmed to THISDAY that there has been a reduction in open grazing in the state.\n\nIfeajika said the state was yet to enact a law against open grazing due to the ongoing strike by parliamentary workers.\n\nDespite the anti-open grazing law in Oyo State, herders are still openly grazing their cattle in most areas of the state.\n\nAreas where open grazing is still going on in the state include Ibarapaland, Oyo/Ogbomoso expressway, Oke Ogun and some parts of Ibadan, the state capital.\n\nThe state House of Assembly in October 2019 passed a bill titled, \u2018Oyo State Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Law\u2019, which was signed into law by Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nHowever, Makinde has expressed the determination of his administration to enforce the law, stating that the state government will within the next eight weeks launch a task force to enforce the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Oyo State, open grazing is against the law. The implementation plan will come out within the next six to eight weeks and the task force will cut across Oyo State. So, whoever goes against the law in this state will face the wrath of law and that is just it.\u201d\n\nMakinde\u2019s Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mr. Taiwo Adisa, while speaking on the challenges facing the implementation of the law, identified the major one as the lack of commitment of the police and other security agencies to enforce the law.\n\nFarmers operating in Ekiti State have also raised the alarm that open grazing of cattle and other ruminant animals are still happening in all the three senatorial districts of the state.\n\nSome farmers told THISDAY in Oke Ako, Irele and Ipao in Ikole Local Government Areas and Ijan and Aisegba in Gbonyin Local Government area as well as Aaye Oja, Igogo and Osan in Moba Council Area that the practice was still effective in their areas.\n\nTHISDAY observed that the practice was even common in Ado Ekiti, the capital city, especially along Ado-Ijan-Ikare, Ado-Iworoko-Ifaki and Ado-Ikere-Akure roads.\n\nHowever, the State Commander of Ekiti State Security Network codenamed Amotekun Corps, Brig. Gen. Joe Komolafe (rtd), said the law was being vigorously enforced by the security outfit.\n\nHe said the outfit had been zealous in the enforcement of ban on open grazing of cattle, adding that some herders and cattle had been arrested with owners already in court facing charges while their cows were confiscated.\n\nAkomolafe added that his officers had engaged in shootout with some herders around 2:00am on more than four occasions around Ikole axis, which he said attested to the proactiveness of Amotekun to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cIt is part of our statutory duties to enforce the law and we are doing it. We have arrested scores of cattle owners who are in court facing charges but their cases got stalled by JUSUN\u2019s strike. Some are still being detained by the police.\n\n\u201cWe know that some herders are still disobeying this law, but we are extending our dragnets against them. Even most of them who are returning to the North due to the advent of rain used to take permission from us and we took pain to escort them to the border in Kwara or Kogi to ensure that no destruction takes place,\u201d he added..\n\nThe ban on open cattle grazing was yet to be enforced in Imo State.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Imo State Government has so far not send any anti-open grazing bill to the House of Assembly.\n\nAt the moment, herdsmen are still seen in the bushes and by the road sides grazing their cattle without anybody or security personnel challenging them.\n\nEven in the Owerri, the capital city, as well as in other various villages and communities, open grazing still goes on unchecked.\n\nAreas where the herdsmen usually go for grazing include Irette, Avu, Obinze, in Owerri West LGA; Emekuku, Agbala, Amakohia/Akwakuma in Owerri North LGA.\n\nOther areas are Obowo, Okigwe, Mbaise, and other Local government areas.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s undisclosed health challenges are taking their toll on his ability to perform his duties as he goes off duty at 5pm daily, a presidential source told SaharaReporters.\n\nAccording to the source, urgent national issues that can benefit the county are left unattended to by the President the moment it is 5pm Nigerian time and postponed till the following day.\n\n\u201cThe President is tired, it\u2019s no more news that he has dementia, a mental sickness that causes memory loss and impaired judgment.\n\n\u201cCurrently, he won\u2019t attend to files till 10am and the moment it\u2019s 5pm, he goes off duty. Even if Nigeria is on fire, he won\u2019t make any decision. Nobody can see him again except members of the (Presidency) cabal and close family members. This is seriously affecting his handling of national matters.\n\n\u201cWe were here when Goodluck Jonathan was President; he would work till 11pm daily,\u201d the source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters in December 2020 had reported how the inability of President Buhari to make critical decisions on insecurity and the depressed economy had become worrisome to many Nigerians \u2013 a situation which his dementia and other undisclosed illnesses he is treating could have contributed to.\n\nIt had been reported that his medical conditions had forced him to jet out of the country at least seven documented times for treatment, spending about 200 days since 2015 when he assumed office in his first term.\n\nOn February 5 to 10, 2016, Buhari took a six-day vacation in the United Kingdom, saying that his doctors lived in England.\n\nBetween June 6 and 19, 2016, Buhari went on a 10-day medical trip to England for an ear infection surgery. He extended his trip by three days to rest.\n\nOn January 19, 2017, the President was back to London again on a medical vacation.\n\nOn February 5, 2017, he wrote to the National Assembly, seeking an extension of his London medical leave.\n\nLater on March 10, 2017, Buhari returned to Nigeria but didn't resume work immediately at Aso Villa. The presidency had claimed that \"he was working from home.\"\n\nOn May 7, 2017, Buhari embarked on a trip to London for another medical vacation. He returned after 104 days \u2013 the longest he had stayed outside the country. He returned to Nigeria on August 19, 2017, and he took time to resume work because his handlers said rats had reportedly damaged furniture in his office.\n\nOn May 8, 2018, Buhari went to London for a four-day \"medical review.\"\n\nOn April 26, 2019, Buhari again left for the UK on a 10-day private visit to seek medical care.

          "text": "Government is a relationship \u2013 between the leadership and the governed. A democratic government, in particular, should not operate in vacancy of citizens\u2019 imprimatur. A government needs the trust, support and goodwill of its citizens. Legitimacy is the reward for good governance. Any government, which by intransigence severs the funiculus that links it with the citizens, is taking the highroad to oblivion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReally, most people will not remember the infrastructure and extraordinary projects executed by an administration. But they will remember how secure they felt and the freedom they enjoyed under that government. General Abacha is reputed to have executed some of the sterling infrastructure projects in Nigeria. In fact, some of the roads his regime through PTF built are still sturdy to date. But how is he remembered today? He is remembered as a murderer and a violator of human rights.\n\nOur leaders should learn from the ruins of others before them. Power is situational. What we do with it when we possess it will live with us, and even with our relics and generations to come. At this point, what I believe should be elemental for President Buhari is his legacy. He should not let \u2018\u2019power hawks\u2019\u2019 carnivorise what is left of his substance.\n\nThe suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian government is a jackboot experiment. It cannot be defended, rationalised or excused in anyway. Internet freedom is as basic as the right to life and the right to freedom of expression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, some notable Nigerians and organisations have condemned this insidious attempt at absolutism. The Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN) led by Kabiru Yusuf said lucidly \u2018\u2019the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operation by Nigeria is wrong and an overreaction\u2019\u2019. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos state, and member of the APC \u2013 the president\u2019s party \u2013 is of the opinion that the federal government should have managed the situation better.\n\n\u201cThe federal government can handle this a lot better \u2014 because of the number of ecommerce; the number of youths doing digital stuff on the internet, and we cannot throw that away and say it\u2019s not happening. I believe there could be a lot of restraint and better management from both sides,\u201d the governor said.\n\nNigeria is said to lose N2.18 billion per day owing to the Twitter shutdown \u2014 according to NetBlocks, a data-driven online service. We do not need an Okonjo-Iweala to divine for us the cost of this folly. Many youths and businesses rely on Twitter for oxygen. And the federal government just pulled the plug \u2014 in a country with 40 million unemployed people, blistering inflation and insecurity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToiling Nigerians lose more in this dogfight between the Nigerian government and Twitter. Twitter loses nothing in the short and in the long run. So, who offended Buhari and who should be writhing from the economic perils of his ban? Well, if the government is deploying this as a gambit to asphyxiate dissenting voices on social media it will be a futile performance. Only good governance can silence the noise on social media.\n\nCitizens from all strata have been giving the government a dressing down in the past few days. As expected, the US, the UK, Canada and EU did not equivocate in expressing disappointment at this punitive approach to an issue that could have been resolved through other channels. The condemnations are in order.\n\nWhat is very annoying is the threat by Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, to arrest and prosecute anyone circumventing the ban to gain access to Twitter. This is farcical. Why is this man making a spectacle of Nigeria in the public square? I think we have enough comedians in the country already.\n\nHowever, there is the pesky issue of hate speech, fake news, misinformation and disinformation on social media \u2014 particularly on Twitter and Facebook? How do we address this problem? We cannot look away and pretend that this creeping monster does not portend enormous danger for Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome countries like India, even the US and the UK, have set these tech leviathans to task regarding sanitising their social media space. We cannot suspend our hands and watch Nigeria burn.\n\nAs Kadaria Ahmed, top journalist, said while reacting to the \u2018\u2019decree\u2019\u2019 of the National Broadcasting Commission to broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts, \u2018\u2019the government (must) go back and engage with experts many of whom abound in the country on how to fight hate speech, misinformation and disinformation while respecting and upholding the rights that are fundamental in a democracy\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe Buhari government must redeem itself. Nigeria is still a democracy.\n\nBy Fredrick \u2018Mr OneNigeria\u2019 Nwabufo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter @FredrickNwabufo\n\n#Keepiton",

Our conversation took place over two plates of half English breakfast, two cups of coffee, and homemade fruit smoothies.\n\nMoyosola Kara is the director of marketing and communications at Eze Wholesale \u2013 a YC-backed startup on a mission to simplify the wholesale electronics trade market. She\u2019s an ambitious straight-shooter who is serious about taking breaks and carving out time to reconnect with herself and the people in her life.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Moyosola to Centre Stage because she\u2019s had an unconventional but rewarding career as a marketing and communications specialist. Her experience working with businesses across multiple industries has equipped her with valuable skills that are needed in today\u2019s digital economy.\n\nTell me the last good book you read\n\nI just finished Untamed by Glennon Doyle. I also read a really good book by Elaine Welteroth. She was the youngest editor in Conde Nast\u2019s history and the second African American person to be made editor-in-chief at Teen Vogue.\n\nYou have described yourself as a homebody who enjoys the occasional getaway. How are you able to marry your introverted personality with your role as a communications executive?\n\nBeing able to switch into extroverted comms mode provides a nice balance. If I had a job in a quiet little cubicle, I would probably be miserable. I get my fix from my job. I get my fix when I interact and engage with my team, and with customers. Human interaction is very important, especially because we are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nTell me about school. What did you study? Where did you go?\n\nI did not study marketing or communications (surprise surprise). I have a Bachelor of Commerce in Law (BCom Law) and it\u2019s a program that is only offered in South Africa. I started off with studying economics, but after my first year and learning more about what economists did for a living, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to go down that career path.\n\nSo, you changed your degree?\n\nYes, I did \u2013 at the start of my second year. Here\u2019s the truth: initially, I thought I was going to enjoy the law aspect of the program. I mean I enjoyed speaking, had gone through Toastmasters, and being a lawyer seemed like a viable career option. I was wrong. In the end, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer.\n\nWow. How were you able to figure out your career path?\n\nI didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do or what kind of career I wanted to pursue. It wasn\u2019t until my time at Elizabeth Arden that I figured out my passion: talking to customers and connecting them to their favourite brands or businesses. When I was in South Africa, Elizabeth Arden was typecast as a beauty brand that catered exclusively to white South African women. Black South African women bought their perfumes, but make-up and skincare? No chance. When Elizabeth Arden was ready to change that image, I became fully immersed in trying to figure out our campaigns and how to speak to this new target audience.\n\nSo you kind of fell into marketing and communications?\n\nBasically. I didn\u2019t realize until years later that what I was doing at Elizabeth Arden was marketing. And I loved it.\n\nHow are you able to wear both hats? Especially because marketing and communications (comms) are two different departments?\n\nMy career in Nigeria started in PR. Then I worked in digital marketing, media, marketing, before finally settling down in a communications role at 54gene. My learnings have prepared me for where I am right now and given me the skills I need to wear both hats effectively well.\n\nHow do you find alignment between the two?\n\nI\u2019ll admit that although they are significantly different, there are parts of marketing and communication that are interwoven. For me, it\u2019s about finding synergy in those interwoven parts. My job is to set key goals and metrics for each department and ensure that we are all working towards achieving them with maximum efficiency. Sometimes, it gets tricky.\n\nHow so?\n\nWell, comms is heavy on messaging and storytelling. While marketing is more tactical and strategic with a lot more moving parts. And obviously, because we are in a fast-paced social media and technology age, digital marketing is hot right now and isn\u2019t what it used to be three years ago.\n\nHow are you able to keep up with the changes?\n\nSocial media is my new learning ground. You\u2019ll be surprised by how much you learn on Twitter, Youtube, and Medium. On the marketing side, I follow themarketingtopic on Twitter and I\u2019m also subscribed to Marketing Brew. I also enjoyed reading Clueless To Designer \u2013 it\u2019s a beginner\u2019s guide to product design written by Mitchelle Chibundu. Mark Manson also writes a newsletter that I\u2019m subscribed to and enjoy reading every now and then.\n\nHow are you applying what you are learning on the job?\n\nMy role at Eze is vastly different from my role at 54gene. With Eze, I\u2019m dealing with markets outside of Africa which means I have to learn how to speak the marketing language for those markets. I have to draw inspiration from marketing leaders who understand what Eze is trying to do in the wholesale ecosystem.\n\nWhat would you say to aspiring and working communications and marketing professionals?\n\nFirstly, prioritize storytelling. Eat, breathe, and live storytelling. Explore how different brands are telling stories and motivating their customers to buy a product or engage with their posts on social media.\n\nSecondly, study consumer behaviour. What is driving people to spend money? What are your customers\u2019 pain points? Who are you selling to?\n\nLastly, invite empathy into your work. Tactics are important but if you don\u2019t know how to connect with your audience on a deeper level, you will lose them to a competitor. A growing number of young buyers are paying attention to businesses that care about promoting social change and impact.\n\nMoyosola\u2019s tip: Empathy and storytelling go hand-in-hand.\n\nWhat does good leadership look like to you?\n\nI believe that leadership is about paying attention to your people. It\u2019s important to be kind, empathetic, and supportive. I think not enough is said about managers who support their team members. You need to move away from just doling out tasks to going over and beyond to arm your team with the tools and resources they need to succeed. I\u2019m dedicated to ensuring that my team members are developing their skill sets and getting access to the training they need.",

          "text": "South African Mobility startup WhereIsMyTransport has raised a $14.5 million Series A extension round to continue its expansion across emerging markets.\n\nThe round was led by Naspers Foundry, Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. This investment comes a year after the company raised a $7.5 million Series A round from investors including Google and Toyota Tsusho. This brings the total raised by the company during its Series A funding to $22 million.\n\nFormed in 2016, WhereIsMyTransport is a big data platform that provides sustainable mobility solutions in emerging markets. It maps formal and informal public transport networks. The company then uses data obtained to improve the public transport experience, making commutes safe and accessible.\n\nIts products are used by cities to coordinate and monitor services, operators to integrate their systems, and passengers, who access the platform through apps and endpoints connected to the WhereIsMyTransport platform. WhereIsMyTransport has been used to enrich Google Maps in Mexico and has helped the World Bank examine access to job opportunities via public transport in 12 African cities.\n\nWith this new investment, WhereIsMyTransport plans to continue its expansion across emerging markets, with a launch in Peru planned for later this year. It has already mapped 34 African cities and has over 100,000 users in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority of the world,\u201d said CEO Devin de Vries.\n\nFabian Whate, head of Naspers Foundry, said WhereIsMyTransport had a strong track record of developing the best-in-class technology for improving the daily commutes of people across the world.\n\n\u201cThe mobility technology company is a great addition to the Naspers Foundry investment portfolio and we look forward to working with the WhereIsMyTransport team as they take their business to the next level,\u201d he said.\n\nMobility in emerging markets via public transportation is often a hassle \u2013 it\u2019s inefficient and time-consuming. The successful expansion of WhereIsMyTransport would reduce friction in the movement of people and goods across Africa and other emerging markets.",

          "title": "Club Swan Creates Services To Address Challenges Faced By Nigerian Entrepreneurs",
          "text": "Abiodun Ajayi \u2013 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Strategist\n\nClub Swan, a global lifestyle club designed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, has launched new services to address challenges faced by Nigerian cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nInnovation in payments first came with the advent of paper money to replace bartering. The second wave of innovation continued with the issuance of credit and debit cards. Now, through technology, we are on the third wave of payment innovation: the blockchain and digital currencies.\n\nTo provide recent historical context, in the late 1990s, many believed mobile phones were too expensive for a large majority of people in Africa. Lack of infrastructure meant that it was unthinkable to just set up a mobile telecommunications market. However, in 1998, Mo Ibrahim saw an opportunity and developed a business model to meet the needs of Africans. This triggered development across the continent and created thousands of jobs. The telecoms industry in Africa is now worth over $200 billion.\n\nToday, cryptocurrency has initiated an entrepreneurial boom in Nigeria. A report by Chain Analysis showed that in 2020, Nigeria ranked first among African countries in peer-to-peer payments. Up to $139 million was traded in peer-to-peer payments in 2020 according to the report.\n\nCryptocurrency activity in Africa.\n\nThe basis of this adoption is the need for viable alternatives to challenges we face in global payments.\n\nNigeria has become a hotbed for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and has unleashed a vibrant crypto and blockchain community alongside a teeming population of digitally native youth who are unabashedly united to participate in the third wave of payment innovation.\n\nTo a large extent, the situations we see in Nigeria are indicative of the trends occurring generally in sub-Saharan Africa. Simply put, there is a wave of enlightenment and Nigerians are willing to test and figure out new ways of doing things facilitated by technology.\n\nWhen oil revenue plunged in 2020, a dollar shortage ensued which devalued the Naira. As of March 2021, the inflation rate in Nigeria hovered around 18%. Aspiring business leaders are now dealing with the fact that current financial options available simply can\u2019t keep up with inflation. Hence, many entrepreneurs have turned to crypto as a viable option.\n\nChallenges faced by Nigerian entrepreneurs\n\nParticipating in Global eCommerce International Settlements\n\nParticipating in Global eCommerce\n\nCryptocurrency allows entrepreneurs to transfer and receive money from anywhere worldwide. However, some face undue obstacles when payment firms place limits on Nigerians.\n\nCrypto has enabled Tola Fadugbagbe, a businessman who moved to Lagos 10 years ago to grow his business. Today, he sources his mobile phones from east Asia and he finds it easier to make payments to his east Asian partners in bitcoin.\n\nCrypto has created a paradigm shift in the way people start to think about emerging markets and creating new business opportunities. The success of cryptocurrency can be attributed to the fact that business owners need alternative ways to conduct trade in a seamless fashion.\n\nInternational Settlements\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology have made it possible for individuals to conduct business virtually without any intermediaries, thereby enabling companies worldwide to reach out to customers across international borders. In the past few years, merchants have leveraged for cross-border payments. According to Lagos vendor Abolaji Odunjo, \u201cmaking payments with Bitcoin makes transactions easier and reduces costs.\u201d\n\nCrypto advantages for Nigerian Entrepreneurs\n\nExpanded payments opportunities\n\nSince the dawn of civilization, payment for goods and services has been ever present. However, it has gone through innovation over the years. From the earliest exchange of goods by barter to the advent of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith crypto, there are expanded payment opportunities. This makes transactions easier and more efficient.\n\nTrusted transactions\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are based on blockchain which is publicly accessible and transparent. The transactions are relatively secure and fast.\n\nWe Nigerians know, the quickest way to build trust is to give customers the quickest response time as we prefer quick service delivery. The entrepreneur or business owner that can provide the shortest time between when the customer makes payment and when the customer receives value ultimately wins the heart of the customer.\n\nDisadvantages of crypto for Nigerian Entrepreneurs\n\nNo reliable methods to off-ramp large amounts of crypto to fiat\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to large funds of $2000 and above, only one reliable service is available to Nigerians. Unfortunately, this service is designed mainly for peer-to-peer transactions, which come with their own set of challenges.\n\nClub Swan provides a reliable bridge\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Club Swan is a global lifestyle concierge membership club designed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Members can take advantage of their payments platform that enables the use of cryptocurrencies alongside traditional currencies. Club Swan created the platform to address the obstacles many legitimate entrepreneurs face when using digital and legacy currencies.\n\nNot only does Club Swan enable its members to use crypto to off ramp to fiat currency and use fiat to purchase crypto currency from its inventory, it also provides an option for its members to receive the Club Swan prepaid card that can be used globally. Moreover, members enjoy expanded flexibilities when it comes to spending as the platform supports three major global currencies. For entrepreneurs that travel extensively, Club Swan provides dedicated concierge, travel and lifestyle services for its members. This includes but is not limited to discounted hotel and airfare and access to exclusive luxury events. Best of all, membership is open to Nigerians and services are geared toward Nigerian entrepreneurs.\n\nTo become a member of Club Swan, go to https://clubswan.com and select the membership tier that suits your needs. All members are vetted through their Know Your Customer protocols and upon successful completion, entrepreneurs can now fully participate in the third wave of payment innovation.\n\n",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

In addition, the body further prohibits media platforms from using User Generated Content (UGC) as sources in their reportage.\n\nThe statement calls for strict compliance citing lines from the NBC Act and The Broadcasting Code that point to media companies having an obligation to adhere to national laws and be mindful of content capable of inciting violence or public unrest.\n\nAlthough not outrightly stated, defaulters could be penalised based on the federation\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s order to prosecute any Nigerian still using the microblogging platform.\n\nThe latest order resulting from the ongoing Twitter suspension in the country since Friday, June 4, 2021, is a way of disincentivising individuals and corporate bodies from patronising Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this proves to be a challenging period for businesses strongly dependent on the social media platform.\n\nWhile the statement does not clearly state what media platforms are affected by the directive, the NBC Act defines broadcasting stations as entities \u2014 like radio, sound, television, cable, or satellite stations \u2014 that have received a broadcasting licence after satisfying the regulator\u2019s requirements. From the definition, it is not clear if new media companies are also caught in this web.\n\nThis is not the first time the NBC is clamping down on broadcasters in the country.\n\nRecall, during the October 2020 #EndSARS protest, NBC suspended three media companies on the claims of using UGC as their sources while accusing them of misinformation and releasing content that could incite unrest.\n\nIn a previous article, we established the role that UGC has played in the past in Nigeria while questioning why it should be forbidden because of the October 20, 2020 Lekki Tollgate Massacre.\n\nFollowing the Twitter suspension order, some digital platforms have disengaged themselves from receiving customer complaints via their Twitter handles, advising users to reach out through other channels; others have put up disclaimer posts about where they are tweeting from.\n\nFor one, recent events have pointed to the intensified drive of the federal government to inhibit free speech, one of the many signs that the country may gradually be borrowing China\u2019s cards.\n\nAs Twitter users in Nigeria find alternatives to access the platform either through VPN and other channels, it remains to be seen how this would ultimately impact journalism, freedom of speech, and timely dissemination of information in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, Nigeria has finally joined the list of countries losing millions of dollars to government-led Internet crackdowns annually. According to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool (COST), the country may have lost up to $18 million (~\u20a66.5 billion) having kept up the order for almost 36 hours.",

          "text": "It is no longer news that the Nigerian government has indefinitely banned Twitter\u2019s operations in the country.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Friday, June 4, 2021. He also revealed the government\u2019s directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to begin the process of licensing over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve seen the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) instruct telcos to suspend access to Twitter.\n\nIn another statement released on Saturday, June 5, 2021, Garba Shehu, the President\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, cited the platform\u2019s role in disseminating false information and fake news as the rationale behind the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also advised disregarding the notion that the ban is a knee-jerk reaction to the deletion of a tweet made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe tweet in question, which referred to the Nigerian Civil War, was removed by Twitter for violating its policy on referencing mass murders, violent events, or specific means of violence where protected groups have been the targets or victims.\n\nThis is not the first time the government has attempted Internet censorship. It had gone the expected legislative route in 2019 with the \u201csocial media bill\u201d, which was outrightly rejected by Nigerians.\n\nThe bill is officially titled \u201cProtection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations and Other Related Matters Bill 2019\u201d and prescribes a \u20a6300,000 ($730) fine or a jail term of up to three years for persons spreading false information or that which could affect the nation\u2019s security and relationship with other countries.\n\nBecause it was perceived to be a gag on citizen\u2019s right to freedom of expression as enshrined in the Constitution, it received a lot of backlash from the Nigerian public. As of press time, the bill has not progressed further than the second reading stage.\n\nSo far, discussions on Techpoint Africa have focused on the economic impact, a possible Internet firewall, and security issues arising from the use of VPN. However, this discourse will analyse the legal issues surrounding the government\u2019s decision.\n\nOur chat with three lawyers \u2014 Co-founder, Tech-Hive Advisory, Ridwan Oloyede; Lead Advisor, Lawrathon, Enyioma Madubuike; and Tech Lawyer and Policy Consultant, Timi Olagunju, \u2014 is detailed below.\n\nIs the ban legal?\n\nAll three lawyers agree that the ban is illegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Oloyede, the ban is \u201can attack and suppression of the freedom of expression guaranteed under the Constitution and other international human right norms that Nigeria is a party to.\u201d\n\nThis right to freedom of expression as contained in Section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) provides for freedom to hold an opinion and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\n\nA 2016 United Nations (UN) resolution on the promotion, protection, and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet guarantees the protection of human rights \u2014 particularly, freedom of expression \u2014 offline and online. A resolution confirmed by Oloyede to have been supported by Nigeria.\n\nOther international treaties which expressly provide for this right include the African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedom, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all of which Nigeria is a party to.\n\nTo put all of this in context, the Constitution is regarded as the \u201cgrundnorm\u201d of all laws in Nigeria. The law from which all other laws, policies, regulations, and guidelines draw their legality. If any of these in any way deviate from the spirit of the Constitution, it cannot stand.\n\nAs Olagunju puts it, these international treaties/conventions are meant to promote rather than restrict this right. The only condition for restriction is where it is expressly provided for by law or as a matter of national security, public order, or the reputation of others. This is also contained in Section 45 of the Constitution.\n\nAccording to Oloyede, the conditions for derogating from human rights under the constitution were not met.\n\n\u201cAn executive decision cannot be considered a law reasonably justified in a democratic society. As we speak, there is no legislation from the National Assembly prohibiting the use.\u201d\n\nAs Madubuike puts it, \u201cThere are processes provided for actions that would impact citizens\u2019 rights; this unilateral action has been done without any due process. None.\u201d\n\nOther aspects to consider under this heading involve the declaration made by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, which effectively orders the prosecution of anyone found using Twitter.\n\nNigerian law clearly states that no one can be prosecuted for a crime that is unknown to law.\n\nAccording to Madubuike, \u201cTweeting is not a crime. The fact that a minister says otherwise does not make it so. Crimes are created by specific laws made by lawmakers, not by declaration of a Minister. We are still a constitutional democracy despite all appearances otherwise.\u201d\n\nNBC, Ministry of Information and Culture, and its powers\n\nThe NBC, by virtue of its establishing Act, has regulatory powers in respect of broadcasting. This means that its purview is in relation to television and radio companies. This places the Commission under the aegis of the Ministry of Information and Culture, headed by Mohammed.\n\nTherefore, in the context of Mohammed\u2019s proclamation, it seems he may have overstepped his bounds\n\nOlagunju attributes the powers exercised by the MInister as likely being under the umbrella of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) as an agency with an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework under the purview of the Ministry for Communication and Digital Economy.\n\nHe also says that the directive regarding OTT and social media licences might be a back door to enacting the social media bill, which must be looked at in light of the National Assembly\u2019s oversight powers in that regard.\n\nOther legal issues which have been raised include the use of videos and pictures gotten from Twitter as evidence in court. Both Oloyede and Olagunju agree that the Evidence Act of Nigeria is more concerned with the relevance of the evidence rather than its source.\n\nThus, a defense of a Twitter ban in such a scenario would not suffice.\n\nWhat we may have to worry about is the Judiciary\u2019s role and independence. Ordinarily, Nigeria practises the doctrine of separation of powers which, as Oloyede explains, means the Executive, Judiciary, and Legislature are independent bodies.\n\nSeveral organisations such as the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) have made known their intentions to contend the legality of the ban in court.\n\nWhile we know the ban is illegal, it is now up to the courts to give a decision.",

          "title": "#TwitterBan: Should Nigerians be worried about VPNs?",
          "text": "Following the announcement of the indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria on Friday, June 4, 2021, Twitter users in the country have opted for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to bypass the ban.\n\nA VPN allows individuals to protect sensitive information by securing a public connection to a private network. Any data that passes through a VPN is converted into a code to prevent unauthorised access. This protects users against probable hacking attacks or theft of crucial data.\n\nWhile the government and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can monitor daily online activities and restrict the websites or apps that Internet subscribers can visit or access, a VPN can provide security solutions that restore online privacy and liberty.\n\nWith a VPN, you can easily browse the Internet without worrying about restrictions, monitoring, or tracking done by the ISPs, government, or even third parties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, while the adoption of VPNs might be a quick solution for users to bypass the Twitter ban, some of these free VPNs are not safe enough to protect or keep users\u2019 data private because they compromise their security.\n\nResearch by the ICSI Networking and Security Group found that 38% of the 283 Android VPNs studied contained malware.\n\nAccording to Fortinet \u2014 an American cybersecurity company \u2014 this malware could be used by cybercriminals to steal users\u2019 data, gain unauthorised access to their data or machine, or launch a cyberattack.\n\nIn 2020, according to research by Nord VPN, seven free VPN providers \u2014 UFO VPN, FAST VPN, Super VPN, Free VPN, Flash VPN, Secure VPN, and Rabbit VPN \u2014 in Hong-Kong exposed 1.2 terabytes of data collected from millions of users who trusted them with their logs even though they claimed to offer no-log policies.\n\nUsers\u2019 data containing sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, emails, home addresses, and passwords were unprotected and publicly made available.\n\nLike the ISPs and the government, some free VPNs track their users\u2019 online activities. The ICSI research discovered that 72% of the free VPN services analysed embedded third-party tracking tools in their software.\n\nThis permits these VPNs to sell the information they collect to third parties and allows advertisers to target users.\n\nSome free VPNs conceal information about sharing or selling user data, but others disclose it in their privacy policies. But how many people read privacy policies before accepting them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFree VPNs are not free because they money rise their operations in other ways. To make revenue, they either sell users\u2019 data to third parties or flood you with ads without your permission.\n\nThe adage then comes to mind, if you are not paying for the product, you are the product.\n\nWhile paid VPNs have ad-blocking tools, malware protection features, and unlimited bandwidth that secure users\u2019 data, free VPNs have a smaller infrastructure, leading to slower Internet speeds.\n\nIn times like the Twitter ban, VPN services might be a solution. However, users must carefully choose what country they connect with because VPNs are illegal in some countries.\n\nTherefore, do your research to ensure your connection is not established in countries like Russia, Uganda, Turkey, and China, amongst others.\n\nUsing a paid VPN will cost you more money than your data subscription. Still, there are affordable paid VPNs that you can access individually or as a family.\n\nComparitech advises that before choosing a paid VPN, look for a provider that actively prevents IP address disclosures. Also, ensure it does not collect log data that users share on it.\n\nLook for a provider that has a VPN kill switch feature. This helps users exit specific programs if an Internet connection fluctuates, reducing the risk of sensitive data being disclosed.\n\nFinally, ensure the VPN you are selecting supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This ensures that only authorised users can gain access to it.\n\nThe VPN might be a temporary solution as the Federal Government, on Saturday, June 5, 2021, reportedly reached out to the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) to discuss plans to build an Internet firewall.\n\nThe Internet firewall, if built, would allow the government to block VPNs. This means that Twitter might not be accessible via some free VPNs.\n\nWhile social media has been a tool for free speech and expression, in 2019, the government introduced the hate speech and social media bills to control the right to speech and expression online.\n\nAlthough the social media bill was brought up again in 2020 due to the #EndSARS protests, with the Twitter ban, it looks like it is already being implemented.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what the government is planning. However, we know that VPNs are temporary solutions to the Twitter ban, and some free VPNs do not guarantee security and privacy.",

AAU is Edo State university; it is not a local university. We must restructure it to meet universal standards.

So, I have to prepare the school to be an international university, which Ambrose Alli meant it to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleading for your support for the sake of our children and for the sake of our future. Please, join me; support me, so that we can clean up AAU, because what it has done and what it can do for Esan land and the entire Edo Central Senatorial District, you cannot imagine,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, former Minister of Works, Mr. Mike Onolememen, assured the governor that the entire Esan people are fully in his support.\n\n...",

          "title": "CBN gas policy holds out promise for domestic market",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThere is high optimism among Oil and gas experts and economic analysts that the target of expanding gas consumption in Nigeria would be substantially achieved with appropriate deployment of the N250bn gas intervention fund set aside by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe use of cooking gas in Nigeria increased to one million metric tonnes in 2020 from about 400MT consumption level recorded four years ago. But operators attribute the increase to the removal of the subsidy on kerosene, noting that Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) penetration was still far from the national target of five million metric tonnes set for next year.\n\nIt is no longer debatable that Nigeria is endowed with enormous natural gas resource. However, how to use this resource to develop and transform the nation\u2019s economy and add significant value to the lives of its citizens remains a major issue for decades.\n\nAccording to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) \u2013the regulator of activities in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, as at January 2020, Nigeria\u2019s proven gas reserves stood at 203.16trillion cubic feet. The nation\u2019s unproven gas reserve is still at about 600trillion cubic feet. These numbers no doubt put Nigeria as a major player in the world gas market, ranking as the ninth largest gas producer globally and the number one on the African continent.\n\nFor long, there have been conversations around how Nigeria can leverage the vast opportunities in its gas resource to open up the country for investments, which will in turn lead to massive job creation, enhanced energy efficiency, increased productivity as well as increased revenue to both government and businesses.\n\nAlthough, Nigeria prides itself as a major exporter of LNG to the world via the Nigeria LNG Limited, making gas available for domestic use through business-friendly government policies and actions will help a great deal in driving economic diversification and competition.\n\nPlayers in the country\u2019s gas sector are of the view that there is no better time to optimise the potential of the gas resources than now that the whole world is struggling to survive the impact of coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTo them, the pandemic and its attendant economic turmoil has presented an opportunity for the country to look inward by prioritising in-country utilisation of the abundant gas resources. They believe there should be increased attention to the development of gas infrastructure in Nigeria and the deepening of domestic consumption and utilisation of the commodity in order to boost the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nHowever, despite the abundant gas potential, Nigeria still struggles to develop and grow its economy, a situation that makes jest of the country at the international front.\n\n\u201cNigeria does represent quite an interesting paradox. We are major resource holders, major exporter of gas, at the same time we struggle on the domestic front with de-industrialization, with unmet domestic gas demand and insufficiency in gas supply to the power sector for power generation,\u201d President of the Nigerian Gas Association (NGA), Mrs Audrey Joe-Ezigbo, once said.\n\nCBN to the rescue\n\nIn order to make Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) the fuel of choice for transportation and LPG the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, captive power and small industrial complexes, the federal government introduced the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP). Under the NGEP, the CBN is providing N250 billion loan to help stimulate investment in the gas value chain as part of its efforts to stimulate finance to critical sectors of the economy.\n\nIn a guideline titled \u2018Framework for the implementation of intervention facility for the national gas expansion programme\u2019, CBN set N10bn as the maximum loan an obligor can access under its N250bn intervention fund for the gas sector.\n\nPart of the term loan conditions for manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, was that the term loan, \u201cShall be determined based on the activity and shall not exceed N10bn per obligor. Working capital is maximum of N500m per obligor.\u201d\n\nIt said the objectives of the facility included improved access to finance for private sector investments in the domestic gas value chain; and also to stimulate investments in the development of infrastructure to optimise the domestic gas resources for economic development.\n\nThe facility, the apex bank said, also aimed to fast-track the adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice for transportation and power generation, as well as LPG as the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, transportation and captive power.\n\nIt would also fast-track the development of gas-based industries particularly petrochemical (fertilizer, methanol, etc) to support large industries, such as agriculture, textile, and related industries; provide leverage for additional private sector investments in the domestic gas market; and boost employment across the country.\n\nEligible activities under the intervention include establishment of gas processing plants and small-scale petrochemical plants; establishment of gas cylinder manufacturing plants; establishment of L-CNG regasification modular systems; and establishment of auto gas conversion kits or components manufacturing plants.\n\nOthers are establishment of CNG primary and secondary compression stations; establishment and manufacturing of LPG retail skid tanks and refilling equipment; development/enhancement of auto gas transportation systems, conversion and distribution infrastructure; and enhancement of domestic cylinder production and distribution by cylinder manufacturing plants and LPG wholesale outlets.\n\nIt also involves the establishment/expansion of micro distribution outlets and service centres for LPG sales, domestic cylinder injection and exchange; and any other mid to downstream gas value chain related activity recommended by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cThe intervention fund by CBN is a welcome development because it will not only support in deepening the consumption of gas but will help ameliorate sicknesses caused by the use of firewood,\u201d an economic analyst with interest in public health, Mr. Bath Onwuachu, told our correspondent.\n\nHe urged operators in the gas industry to take advantage of the fund to further expand the sector and increase the penetration of gas consumption. According to Onwuachu, deepening of gas usage would reduce the rate of deforestation, a development that would impact positively on the environment.\n\nMr. Lambert Ojo, a gas processing and evaporative cooling specialist, believes the intervention for local investors in the gas sector would stimulate the economy. He, however, called for a transparent and seamless process when obtaining the facility from the apex bank in order to encourage industry players.\n\n\u201cWe have enough to do in the domestic gas space. What is happening internationally in the near future should not affect us because there\u2019s a lot we can do with our resource,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF), Ahmed Bobboi, stated that PEF was aligning with the CBN and the federal government to further deepen the consumption of gas in Nigeria. He said to achieve this, the agency was planning to equalise gas price so as to ensure that more citizens had access to gas.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are trying to introduce the bridging scheme to gas because government has declared this year till 2030 as a decade of gas.\n\n\u201cAnd we say if this (petrol price equalisation) is working for the economy for over 45 years now effectively, if we can extend the practice to gas we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain.\u201d",

          "text": "Two persons were reportedly shot and injured on Saturday after residents of a community, recently attacked by bandits, blocked the convoy of Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State while protesting against insecurity in the state.\n\nThe protest followed the killing of 88 persons by bandits in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area of the state on Thursday.\n\nResidents said a vehicle attached to the governor\u2019s convoy was burnt by the protesters after shots fired by security agents to disperse the crowd hit two persons. The two men were said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in the state, Premium Times reported.\n\nMr Bagudu was in the council area on Saturday to condole with the people over the killings. However, some residents burnt used tyres on the streets, booed the governor and attacked his convoy over his alleged poor handling of security challenges in the areas.\n\nThe Emir of Zuru, Muhammadu Sani-Sami, who confirmed the incident in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, said the governor was in the area to sympathise with the residents, following the bandits\u2019 attack, when the incident happened.\n\nThe governor usually visits and sympathise with residents whenever such things happened and promised to bring an end to such attacks but they keep on reoccurring, the emir said.\n\n\u201cBut the youth this time came out en masse and showed their grievances, maybe because they did not see any change, despite the repeated promise to stop the attacks,\u201d the traditional ruler said.\n\nMr Sani-Sami, however, said the governments was doing its best to forestall the attacks but noted that security agents in the area do not have the numbers to stop the bandits.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday when he paid a condolence visit to the affected communities, the governor regretted the nefarious acts of banditry in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is really unfortunate that these obnoxious and deadly attacks occurred after the area had been quiet and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow this vicious cycle to continue, as such, all hands must be on deck to provide plausible solutions to the problem,\u201d Mr Sarki quoted his governor saying in the statement.\n\nThe governor also admonished the people to regard the tragic incident as an act of the Almighty Allah and urged the residents to pray for God\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe governor also urged vigilante groups in the area to collaborate with the security agencies, traditional rulers and the various communities, to ensure the success of their activities.\n\nIn his remark, the village head of Gaya, one of the attacked communities, Ahmad Ubandoma, narrated how the attacks happened and urged the governor to facilitate the deployment of more security personnel in the area.\n\nDanko-Wasagu, like Sakaba LGA where bandits killed nine police officers in April, shares boundary with Zamfara and Niger states.\n\nAt least 88 people were killed by bandits in attacks on some communities in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area.\n\nSome of the affected communities are Koro, Kimpi, Gaya, Dimi, Zutu, Rafin Gora and Iguenge, all of which are described as difficult to access from Kebbi State.\n\nThe governor, following the incidents, urged residents to be optimistic about the security situation in their area. He said passing blame will not solve the problems and pledged to take more pungent measures against the bandits.\n\n\u201cWe should note that passing blame will not solve the problem. What is required (is) mutual trust and respect for all,\u201d the governor\u2019s spokesperson, Yahaya Sarki, said in a statement.\n\nMr Sarki was, however, silent on the violent protest in the affected areas.\n\nCredit: Premium Times",

          "text": "Two non-governmental organisations, Media Rights Agenda (MRA) and the International Press Centre (IPC) have condemned the Federal Government\u2019s indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria and threatened to lodge a formal complaint before the appropriate agencies of the African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) if the government does not immediately rescind its decision.\n\nThe organisations condemned the government\u2019s action as a violation of international norms and standards, citing the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights\u2019 Resolution 362 on the Right to Freedom of Information and Expression on the Internet in Africa, adopted on November 4, 2016 at its 59th Ordinary Session; the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, adopted by the Commission in November 2019, at its 65th Ordinary Session; and recent UN Human Rights Council resolutions touching on the matter.\n\nArguing that the action is an unjustifiable violation of the rights of all Nigerians to freedom of expression and access to information, while also contravening the relevant instruments of both bodies.\n\nIn the statement signed by MRA\u2019s Executive Director, Mr. Edetaen Ojo; and the Executive Director of IPC, Mr. Lanre Arogundade, the organizations noted that in its Resolution 362 of 2016, the African Commission has expressed concern at the practice by African States of \u201cinterrupting or limiting access to telecommunication services such as the Internet, social media and messaging services.\u201d\n\nBesides, they said, the Declaration of Principles also provides in Principle 38 (1) and (2) that \u201cStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards\u201d and that \u201cStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\u201d\n\nThe organizations also cited the UN Human Rights Council resolution on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, adopted at its 38th Session in July 2018, in it asked \u201call States to address security concerns on the Internet in accordance with their international human rights obligations to ensure the protection of all human rights online, in particular freedom of opinion and expression.\n\nIn addition, they noted that in its latest resolution related to the matter, which was adopted at its 45th Session in October 2020, the Council has also unequivocally condemned \u201cmeasures in violation of international human rights law aiming to or that intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online and offline, which undermine the work of journalists in informing the public, including through practices such as Internet shutdowns.\n\nThe organizations called on the Federal Government to urgently take steps to comply with these internationally agreed norms and standards and retrace its steps from its current path, which puts Nigeria in danger of becoming a rogue nation that is constantly violating international human rights law as well as the principles of international law.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr. Ojo, said: \u201cThe Government\u2019s claim on the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence is not only unsubstantiated, but is clearly bogus and illogical.\n\n\u201cThe pertinent questions here are: who is the government accusing of using the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence? Is it the owners of Twitter that are posting such tweets? Is it foreigners using the platform for such activities? Or is it all Nigerians who are on Twitter or some of those Nigerians who use Twitter? The Government needs to be specific on this\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf some Nigerians on Twitter are using it in a manner that displeases the Government, how is banning Twitter for all Nigerians, in contravention of international norms an appropriate response? And if the government is convinced that people should not be allowed to post whatever they like on Twitter, no matter how divisive, hateful or inciting, why was the Government itself so angry when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, which it adjudged to be in violation of this same principle?\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Arogundade said: \u201cOn the surface the government claims it is fighting Twitter but in reality what it is doing is waging war against its own citizens by infringing on their fundamental and socio-economic rights despite their being constitutionally guaranteed. If anything, the threat by the Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), to prosecute anyone that disobeys the ban is indicative of the fact that if this government has its way all social media platforms would be shut down because they have become veritable avenues for citizens to express their disaffection with its acts of mis-governance\u201d.\n\nHe added that, \u201cthe ban does not show that the government is serious about the welfare or economic well-being of the citizens otherwise it would have given due consideration to how the decision would disrupt businesses that are transacted by many individuals and corporate bodies on Twitter and affect investor confidence in the Nigerian economy before rushing to make the announcement.\u201d",

It is no coincidence that the last time Nigeria saw an infrastructure revolution on this scale was during the period, in the late 1990s, when the President ran the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF).\u201d\n\nBeyond the focus on completing inherited and abandoned projects, the Buhari administration has creatively unlocked public and private sector financing for infrastructure in Nigeria, through such initiatives as the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), the Highway Development Management Initiative (HDMI), the Sovereign Sukuk Bonds (that have collectively raised close to a billion dollars), and the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme.\n\nREAD ALSO: BREAKING: Pastor Adeboye Decries Twitter Ban, Says Action Covered Against Universal Declaration On Human Rights\n\n\u201cThese initiatives cover thousands of kilometres of critical roads and will mobilize several billions of dollars in public and private financing.\n\n\u201cThis week, the President will commission the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail, the first double-track Standard Gauge Rail project in West Africa (and the first Standard Gauge Rail project in Nigeria to be started and completed by the same administration).\n\n\u201cThis landmark commissioning is taking place nine months after the President commissioned the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail, completed by his administration 33 years after construction began.\n\n\u201cThe 168km Abuja-Kaduna Rail project, and the 42.5km Abuja Light Rail project, both inherited from previous administrations, were completed in 2016 and 2018 respectively.\n\nThe second Niger Bridge, originally conceived decades ago, is now more than 50 percent completed, and scheduled for commissioning in 2022, as is the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, which has defied every administration since 1999.\u201d\n\nThe group indicated that other landmark projects being completed include the Bodo-Bonny Road in Rivers State, Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki Expressway, Loko-Oweto Bridge connecting Benue and Nasarawa States across the River Benue, Port Harcourt-Enugu Expressway, East-West Road (across Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa-Ibom and Cross River States), the new Ikom Bridge in Cross River, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway, Keffi-Akwanga-Lafia-Makurdi Road, and many more.\n\n\u201cNew International Airport Terminals have also, been completed and commissioned in Abuja and Port Harcourt, while those in Lagos and Kano are being completed.\n\n\u201cIn addition, brand new Runways have been constructed in Abuja and Enugu, in 2017 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cOff-grid solar and gas electrification programmes are being rolled out for homes, markets, educational institutions (Federal Universities, Unity Schools, Primary Healthcare Centers); and a National Mass Metering Programme launched in 2020 will deliver 6 million new electricity meters nationwide.\u201d\n\nThe statement further stated that the administration is also enabling and supporting private sector to invest in critical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cA brand new Deep Sea Port is being constructed, in Lagos, the first new Deep Sea Port in the country in more than four decades; while ground-breaking for a second private-sector-funded Deep Sea Port (in Bonny) took place in March 2021.\n\n\u201cWith a diverse mix of financing options in place, the Buhari Administration has broken Nigeria\u2019s decades-old infrastructure development jinx and set new standards for future administrations to build upon,\u201d the group emphasised.",

          "text": "By Daniels Ekugo\n\nHyundai Motor Nigeria has launched its all-new CRETA vehicle in Nigeria with a redesigned and more powerful SUV model set to create unparalleled driving experiences for customers across the region.\n\nUnveiled during the press launch, the second-generation CRETA has been transformed into the ultimate sub-compact SUV for any terrain.\n\nBuilding on the success of the first model, the fresh-look CRETA is more spacious, boasts improved features and utilizes state-of-the-art technologies to meet the complete needs of working professionals, young peer group and families.\n\nCentral to Hyundai\u2019s vision of delivering a superior experience is performance and the CRETA is installed with highly evolved powertrain engines, bringing incredible power and cleaner emissions.\n\nMr Gaurav Vashisht, Head Sales and Marketing at Hyundai Motors Nigeria, said: \u201cDeveloping high-quality vehicles are at the core of our vision and this is reflected with the all-new Hyundai CRETA model.\n\n\u201cSince the first model was launched, the CRETA has become one of the most popular vehicles and the latest version is set to be a game-changer in the sub-compact SUV segment.\n\n\u201dFrom top to bottom, we have crafted the car carefully, pushing the boundaries to ensure that it stands out on the road and is equipped with a wide range of improved features that will deliver even more fun-loving driving experiences.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the new CRETA is no like no other vehicle. It\u2019s a true urban crossover with loads of versatility that is modern, sensuous and sporty in design.\u201d\n\nThe all-new Creta comes with a choice of three engines. The Smart stream G1.5 (maximum power of 115ps/6,300rpm and maximum torque of 14.7kgf.m/4,500rpm) and the Kappa 1.4T-GDI (140ps/6,000rpm and 24.7kgf.m/1,500-3,200rpm) are both gasoline engines, providing better fuel economy on the roads.\n\nOffering more choice is the diesel U2 1.5 VGT (DSL) engine, which has a maximum power of 115ps/4,000rpm and a maximum torque of 25.5kgf.m/1,500-2,750rpm.\n\nTo match the performance, Hyundai has made significant improvements to both the interior and exterior including the size. At 4,300mm (length) and 1,790mm (width), the outside of the CRETA is 20mm and 10mm bigger respectively than the first model.\n\nThe masculine personality on the front is reflected through the grille\u2019s bold and rectangular latticework, holding a bigger and more striking H-logo as well as distinctive two-tier headlamps. The addition of sinewy character lines over the clamshell-type bonnet also reinforces the masculine identity.\n\nThe quality of the exterior is replicated inside with the increase in size providing more space, comfort and convenience.\n\nFitted with a 4-speaker system, passengers can benefit from crisp and exceptional audio quality when listening to music on the go.\n\nThe premium interior is completed with a multi-functional 3.5inch TFT LCD cluster and the optional fully digital 7-inch supervision version, delivering information in rich detail with unprecedented speed and precision.\n\nWith the passengers\u2019 safety the utmost priority for Hyundai, the CRETA is safer than before. The body structure is made of advanced ultra-high tensile-strength steel, giving it exceptional crash resistance.\n\nRear disc brakes have also been installed while the driver can use the rearview camera when parking.

          "text": "Nigeria and Cameroon will once more battle it out at the Stadion Wiener Neustadt in the second of a two-match friendly programme in the Austrian capital, Vienna.\n\nFive \u2013time African champions Cameroon edged the first encounter 1-0 at the same venue on Friday, courtesy of a 36th minute strike by Andre Zambo Nguissa. The Super Eagles created chance after chance but failed to get the ball into the net.\n\nCoach Gernot Rohr spoke at length about having to use a rash of new players in the first session, but he is compelled to do even more of that in Tuesday\u2019s encounter following injuries to defenders William Ekong and Jamilu Collins, and the knock for pacy winger Moses Simon.\n\nSimon appeared to be getting better as of Monday morning, but the smart money is on him starting from the bench, just as Cyprus-based goalkeeper Francis Uzoho may start in goal against the Indomitable Lions. With the versatile Abdullahi Shehu heaved back to the rear from midfield for which he was initially pencilled down, and the couple of injuries from Friday\u2019s match, Rohr has had to extend invitation to Hungary \u2013based Vincent Onovo to fight for his first cap. Onovo arrived in the team hotel just after dinner on Sunday.\n\nA three-man defenceline is in the offing, with perhaps Chidozie Awaziem, who impressed in that unit on Friday, Abdullahi and Ozornwafor. Another late invitee, Anthony Izuchukwu, from Slovakia, is another possibility. A loaded midfield could include Onovo, with Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebo, Samson Tijani and Abraham Marcus also on the roll.\n\nHome \u2013based professional Anayo Iwuala could start, with Paul Onuachu, Peter Olayinka, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, Moses Simon, Terem Moffi and Captain Ahmed Musa also to taste action.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s game, Rohr told the media: \u201cWe missed seven key players due to injuries, so it was not our best team, but it was good to see other players. We are not happy to lose the game, but we saw some interesting new young players.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s defeat was Rohr\u2019s first loss to Cameroon in four matches. The Eagles pounded the Lions 4-0 in Uyo and were held 1-1 in Yaounde in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches in September 2017, and then edged the Lions 3-2 in the Round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt two years ago.\n\nThough a friendly game, fierce rivals Cameroon were very happy to prevail over Nigeria for the first time since winning the Africa Cup of Nations final on penalty shoot-out in Lagos 21 years ago. \u201cWe took the game seriously because we played against a tough opponent, a big game against a big rival. It was important for us to show our preparations, and I\u2019m happy we won,\u201d said Cameroon\u2019s Germany-based striker Eric Choupo-Moting.\n\nA sense of purpose to win the second game reigns supreme in the Eagles\u2019 Hilton Garden Inn camp in Wiener Neustadt, 46 kilometres outside Vienna.\n\nAfter a one-hour training session in the light drizzle on Sunday morning, the three-time African champions will have their last training session at the match venue on Monday evening. Captain Ahmed Musa says defeat in Tuesday\u2019s game is not an option.\n\n\u201cWe are not happy to have created so many chances and fail to score. We will approach the game differently on Tuesday. Cameroon is a big rival and we are not happy to have lost the game on Friday.\u201d\n\nGoalkeeper Maduka Okoye told thenff.com: \u201cWe bave taken some positives from the first match against Cameroon. We had a good game and it was unfortunate that they scored with just that one shot on target. However, we have shown that we are ready for the AFCON with the strength of character we showed after conceding the goal. We are ready to go for it on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nNew-boy Abraham Marcus said it was a dream come true for him to join up with the Nigeria camp. \u201cWhen the coach introduced me into the game, all I had in mind was to help the team get the equalizer. I look forward to another opportunity on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nBoth teams have qualified for the finals of the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations, which Cameroon will host in January 2022. Nigeria finished top of their group winning four of six matches and drawing two, while Cameroon also topped theirs though they had already qualified as hosts.\n\nThe two teams are using both matches to look at their general shape, form and structure ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches starting in September.",
