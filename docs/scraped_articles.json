          "title": "How Oshoala\u2019s influence made me bag first class from UNILAG -Sister",
          "text": "Sherifat Omosholape, Barcelona attacker and Super Falcons captain, Asisat Oshoala\u2019s younger sister is one of the 281 students who graduated with first class during the 51st convocation of the University of Lagos.\n\nSherifat, who graduated with a cumulative gradient point average of 4.98 out of the possible five points, shares how her sister\u2019s fame and success as a pro-footballer influenced her to study harder and emerge with first class in Mass Communication in this interview with SODIQ OYELEKE\n\nWhat would you describe as your motivation?\n\nI was motivated by a lot of things, top of which is my family, faith and the future i.e fear of failure.\n\nMy family is a huge inspiration to me in every sense. Everyone has the go-getter instinct and that pushes me to be the best I can be. I am also inspired by my fastidious and devout late mother, my no-nonsense father, and my elder sister who is a pro-footballer. Their drive and self-belief to be the best at what they do motivate me a lot. Also, in school, I was surrounded by a lot of smart and promising friends, school mates and colleagues who never ceased to put me on my toes. My lecturers, Dr. Shaibu Husseini, among others served as practical examples and set the tone for us to excel. Another thing is the stereotypical views about women in hijab. I am always happy to show the world that there is more to being a Muslim and excellence is part of it.\n\nIs there anything you did differently?\n\nI honestly just tried to be consistent and prayerful, because I believe it\u2019s God\u2019s grace that matters.\n\nI had interests in some other fields like fashion and entrepreneurship but I eventually had to focus on the degree because my parents advised I take things poco a poco.\n\nHave you always emerged top in your class?\n\nFor me, the turning point was my Senior Secondary School because I was extremely playful and carefree in my Junior School. I\u2019ve had excellent academic records since my senior school and I was the valedictorian\n\nof my graduating set in 2015 at Longford International School, Ebute Metta.\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced?\n\nFinding the right balance between academic and social life was a great challenge in my early years. It was quite difficult to manage the freedom I\u2019d just gotten as an undergraduate because I\u2019d never left home before then. Nevertheless, I wanted to stay focused so I had to put some very strict concentrated mechanisms in place to try to set my priority straight. Although, it took a while.\n\nDid the success or fame of your sister has any influence on your academic prowess?\n\nYes, it did. Her success gives me this strong conviction that I can achieve anything, so far I set my mind to it. I have had the privilege to see my sister battle tooth and nail to attain greatness. If I don\u2019t get motivated by how much work she puts into her career and how much of a fighter she is, then something must be wrong somewhere. My sister is the quintessential role model. Her work ethic and dedication have a ripple effect on all of us. I am really glad to have a closer look into her journey from grass to grace, and it\u2019s absolutely inspiring. She\u2019s my role model and her success influences me a lot.\n\nWhat was her reaction after your emergence with first class?\n\nShe was overjoyed. You know, she doesn\u2019t settle for less. For her, excellence is very key. She prayed for my continuous growth and also, challenged me to never relent. In her words, The Oshoalas brag different.\n\nHas she promised you any gift \u2013 a car, house, special trip?\n\n[Laughs] Yes, she is definitely going to get me something. But I don\u2019t want to talk about that.\n\nDo you have any passion for sport or take part in any sporting activities?\n\nNot at all. I cannot kick a football to save someone. I liked running in Primary/Secondary School, I fainted once while at it, so I found my square root. Of course, that was mere child\u2019s play.\n\nI have a keen passion for broadcasting which influenced my studying Mass Communication and attending National Broadcast Academy. I also run a News programme titled \u2018News Wrap Up\u2019 and another programme, \u2018Up-Close\u2019 which are also towards honing my skills in the field.\n\nWhat\u2019s your advice to other students?\n\nI\u2019m still a toddler trying to walk through the path of success. However, my advice to students is to stay consistently focused, work and also, play hard. Also, it is very important to put God first.\n\nWhere would you likely be in the next five years?\n\nI\u2019d love to attain the heights of the Broadcasting profession. As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019d love to own a Broadcast outfit, that is, having acquired and to a reasonable extent, honed my skill in the field and working for renowned stations like the BBC. I also wish to further my academics by acquiring both Master\u2019s and PhD degrees. And then, I\u2019d love to do some fashion influencing, by the side. In five years, by Allah\u2019s grace, I should have achieved some of this while working towards others.",

          "text": "By Adesina Wahab\n\nThe Supreme Head, Cherubim & Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria, His Eminence, Prophet Solomon Adegboyega Alao, has called on politicians with conscience and unquestionable integrity to come together and save Nigeria from disintegration.\n\nThe clergyman, in a statement to thedailynewsngr.com in Lagos on Friday, said the precarious situation in the country called for principled politicians to forget their political differences and work together to provide an alternative to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, at the centre.\n\nHe said while many Nigerians at the onset had confidence in President Muhammadu Buhari because of his antecedent, \u201cit appears that forces beyond his control are not helping him to deliver on his promises. I have suggested to Mr President to allow opinions to flow freely, particularly from the critics\u201d.\n\nThe Head of C & S worldwide said that he was one of the firm believers in the unity of Nigeria and he is also of the conviction that Nigerians would be better to stay together and enjoy maximum benefits of unity in diversity, but regretted that the administration at the centre was doing the opposite of what would keep this country united by being insensitive to criticism.\n\n\u201cIn my honest opinion, brute force would not solve our problem,\u201d he said.\n\nProphet Alao berated the government for arresting leaders of agitation for secession of Nigeria, noting that dialogue and improvement on the welfare of the citizens and good governance would end all agitations.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is na\u00efve for anybody to say that our continued togetherness as a country is not negotiable. There is nothing that is not negotiable except death. The clamour for restructuring and devolving more power to the state to reduce the burden on the centre must be looked into.\n\n\u201cIt is normal for people to agitate but the government can calm the situation by inviting the agitators for a dialogue.\n\nGovernment should address some of the contentious issues they are raising and consider the call for restructuring as one of the immediate solutions to ethnic crises in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBesides, the failure of the government to fulfil its campaign promises on true federalism, curbing of insecurity, economy and employment for the teeming youths roaming the streets are major challenges threatening the peace of the country. Also, the alleged seeming non-adherence to the federal character in terms of appointment to top security positions is giving the government a bad name due to insensitive advisers. I advise the President to rectify this urgently\u201d.\n\nProphet Alao also expressed displeasure at the defection of some governors from the opposition parties to the ruling APC, saying that their motives were not to deepen democracy but to escape justice after their tenure.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that APC is accepting these bread and butter politicians. The APC ought to have asked why didn\u2019t they defect during their first term in office.\n\n\u201cWe all heard a former APC chairman when he told the governors from the opposition parties to decamp to the APC for their sins to be forgiven. Now we can see the rush to the ruling party, but they should know that it is not in the interest of this country to have a one-party state. The late Ghanaian President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah tried it, but he failed\u201d.\n\nHe also criticised the arrest of some Christians inside the church for their anti-Buhari posture.\n\nHe told thedailynewsngr.com that It was sacrilegious for security agents to storm a church and arrest people because of their anti-Buhari posture.\n\n\u201cI am not making case for them but I am concerned that they did not respect a sanctuary of God. Can they go inside a courtroom and arrest a suspect in the presence of a Judge?\u201d\n\nProphet Alao advised the federal government to reconsider its decision on social media and consider unfettered information as one of the critical ingredients of democracy.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nThe Federal Government will soon establish an Aerospace University to address the challenges of qualified and specialized manpower in the nation\u2019s aviation sector.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, made this known at the weekly ministerial press briefing organized by the Presidential Communication Team led by the President\u2019s spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, at the presidential villa, Abuja.\n\nSirika explained that the university would be world class and would collaborate with some famous institutions.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, civil aviation alone can sustain our economy. Ethiopia is half-Nigeria, there are 85 million people and their major source of income and economy is Ethiopian Airlines.\n\n\u201cSo, civil aviation alone can actually run an economy, it depends on how you do it.\n\n\u201cBut we have seen that we are not producing anything out of civil aviation and all the aviation ventures in the country keep collapsing and that has compounded the problem. We attribute that to the lack of capacity to manage.\n\n\u201cSo we are going to establish the institution in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), other friendly countries and some universities around the world.\n\n\u201cSo, it will be a world class university and there is a small team working on it now. We have submitted our concept notes to the Nigerian Universities Commission and it is being attended to.\n\n\u201cI think this university will come up very soon, before the end of the year. The Minister of the FCT has given us the land. It will be half online and half real time studies.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the university when operational would boost activities as well as produce the needed manpower in the aviation sector.\n\n\u201cWe started this journey in civil aviation with countries like Brazil.\n\n\u201cWe started our own in Zaria in 1963, with a partnership between Nigerian government and the UNDP and since then, till now, we don\u2019t produce even rivets as a nation but Brazil that we started with is now producing all sorts of aircrafts.\n\n\u201cSo, we think that we should have a university to go deeply into research and development and create those opportunities within our sector and turn out those young men and women with good brains to go into the venture of aerospace and aviation,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the proposed national carrier for the country, the minister revealed that the carrier would come on board in 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians should trust that we will be able to deliver a very robust carrier that will be for the size of our economy and we are on course.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have almost gone past the project development stage, we have completed the development of the Outline Business Case (OBC), we have got a compliance certificate of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) and it is our intention that we will take the OBC back to the Federal Executive Council perhaps by next Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are on our way. As for the timeline, we will have this airline in 2022 by the grace of God and we will start with the domestic and escalate into international.\n\n\u201cWe are discussing and we will get the best deal for Nigeria and Nigerians because for sure, the market is there,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the minister, all is being done to make air transportation more affordable for citizens, through an improvement of facilities and services.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a country of over 200 million people who are highly mobile. So, what we are doing is first and foremost, to develop the infrastructure that will make civil aviation function.\n\n\u201cAnd once that is done, it will increase the availability of the service and because there is more supply it will help in bringing down the price,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said all the achievements he enumerated were contained in a roadmap developed for the aviation sector, which had since been approved by President Muhammadu Buhari.

The variant is expected to spread to more countries.\n\nThe variant has also been linked to a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation. There are ongoing studies to understand the impact of the variant on existing vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nIhekweazu noted that as part of the country\u2019s COVID-19 response, the agency had been working with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic sequencing.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the detection of variants of concern, and initiate response activities. All data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data. Given the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travelers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to him, the Federal Government through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) has initiated several measures to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19.\n\nThis, he said includes the introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with widespread prevalence of variants of concern. The national travel protocol which includes compulsory seven-day self-isolation and repeat test on the seventh day after arrival, are in place to reduce the risk of spread of the virus.\n\nThe NCDC stressed that it was very important that this was strictly adhered to, to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.\n\nIhekweazu said: \u201cProven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nBritish Government has raised the alarm that the rising conflicts could destabilise Nigeria\u2019s democracy in the run-up to the 2023 elections.\n\nThis is even as the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) declared that the level of insecurity across the country is not only eroding citizens safety and peoples means of livelihood but also threatening the expression of the rights of Nigerians.\n\nThey both spoke at the launch of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative (PISI) in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nChris Beecroft, development director, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), in his good will message, blamed the frequent crisis on injustice and impunity and weak justice institutions in the country. He said peace and stability could be achieved when causes of conflict are managed through strong, fair and responsive governance mechanisms at community, state or federal levels. He stressed that the conflict represents an existential threat to Nigeria\u2019s unity and its development.\n\n\u201cThere is an active insurgency in the North East, farmer-herder conflicts are extending across the country, resource conflicts in the Delta, tension in the South-East and banditry in the North West. Conflict destroys lives, destroys livelihoods, destroys hope and ambition for the future. Conflict represents an existential threat to Nigeria\u2019s unity and its development.\u201d\n\nBeecroft explained that the use of police and army would only be part of the solution and called for greater emphasis on reconciliation, mediation, arbitration, and access to justice \u2013 all vital components of a vibrant, resilient, and effective social contract.\n\nAccording to him, proliferation of small arms and weapons and the weaponisation of social media are drivers of conflict and instability.\n\nHe called for job creation for young Nigerians \u201cso they have a stake in a prosperous and peaceful Nigeria,\u201d adding however, that \u201cwith the right commitment, dedications and support, there are solutions.\u201d\n\nBeecroft stated that the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office recognised the important role the NGF plays in setting the peace and security agenda and in building state and community level structures and institutions to reduce violence and respond to conflict and insecurity across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe UK is pleased to have been able to support this initiative and is committed to continue working with the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) in advancing its peace and security agenda.\n\n\u201cThe UK is engaged in supporting Nigeria to reduce violent conflict in a number of areas. We promote a regional response in the North East and Lake Chad Basin through our contribution to the Regional Stabilisation Facility (RSF) and delivery of programmes on peace building, humanitarian assistance, protection of civilians, human development, good governance and accountability.\u201d\n\nFormer head of state and Chairman of National Peace Committee Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd), in his remarks, expressed worry over what he called the instrumentalisation of violence, noting that violence has become a commodity in Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar, who was represented by Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Fr. Matthew Hassan Kukah, said Nigerians were in denial of the diagnosis. He said poverty was not the cause of violence in Nigeria, arguing that China has about 300 million unemployed.\n\nNGF\u2019s chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues, confessed that the spate of violence and coordinated criminal activities have undermined government authority and waned public trust in recent times.\n\nHe attributed the current security crisis to several factors \u201cincluding an oversized population that the government is unable to cope with, a large number of poor people estimated at over 40 percent of the population who are living below $1 per day and indeed, desertification which has affected over 60 percent of Nigeria\u2019s land as drought and climate change has continued to aggravate land deterioration in the country.\u201d\n\nThe NGF chairman also blamed the situation on proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which he said worsened and exacerbated the level of violence and fatalities.\n\nHe said between May 2011 and February 2021, over 76,000 deaths were reported.\n\n\u201cThis number also includes persons who have been killed by a state actor. In addition to the proliferation of arms is an undertone of rising ethnic conflict, with different ethnic groups subsumed in conflicts and pitched against one another.\u201d\n\nNGF\u2019s Director General, Asishana Okauru, explained that the launch forged a significant step in the life of the NGF as \u201cwe strive to build a nation where safety of lives and property is guaranteed.The Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative is a consequence of our determination to contribute to the conversation on inclusive security and add the leverage of the sub-nationals to the efforts to secure the lives and property of our country men and women.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nMinister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has disclosed that Nigerian airlines are owing federal agencies to the tune of N37 billion.\n\nHe said while Arik owes about N13bllion or N14billion, Bi-Courtney is owing Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) about N14 billion, adding that for the past 13 years since it began operations, it has not remitted a single dime to them as stipulated in the agreement.\n\nSirika, who was the guest at this week\u2019s ministerial press briefing organised by the Presidential Communication Team at the presidential villa, Abuja, said the debt was owed to agencies including Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) among others.\n\nAccording to him, government had been cautious in demanding for the payment mindful of how the media and the Nigerian public might react.\n\nThe Minister, however, vowed that the government would go after the airlines to make sure that they pay what they owe.\n\nSirika, who addressed the controversy over the disbursement of the N5 billion COVID-19 palliative to aviation stakeholders, said the point was made that airlines owing aviation parastatals should not benefit.\n\nHe explained: \u201cIn fact, the service providers in our system, FAAN, NAMA, said oh these guys are owing us, we should take the money from the money being given as palliatives. We said no but the intent of President Buhari is to ensure that he cushion the effect on businesses. Let us find a way of surviving, and let them take the money. So we would have taken the money and left them with nothing and we stay with nothing.\n\n\u201cSo, this brings to the question on the money owed the parastatals. It is about N37 billion that they are owing, especially Arik, the culprit. I know they\u2019re owing us about, N13 billion or N14 billion.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re owing government, you are owing FAAN, the Bi-Courtney is owing about N14 billion as at the last count. It has not paid a single dime since the time he started to run the terminal building. And we have not ceased giving him electricity, water, fire cover, and so on and so forth. He hasn\u2019t paid a dime for 13 years.\n\n\u201cAnd if we go to shut his doors, media, of course, and Nigerian people will say we\u2019re killing businesses but he is killing our services too, because we have to have that money to provide for that toilet that you\u2019re looking for in Lagos Airport.

          "title": "Oba of Benin, Obaseki Set for Showdown over Looted Artefacts",
          "text": "*FG demands unconditional repatriation from Germany\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nExcept a compromise is reached, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, are heading for a showdown over the impending return by Germany and the United Kingdom of artefacts stolen from the Benin Palace in 1897 during a raid by the colonial invaders.\n\nWhile the monarch favours the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, or in the alternative, a museum to be built and managed by the federal and state governments, the palace believes the governor prefers a private trust to take custody of, and manage the ancient precious artworks.\n\nHowever, Obaseki told THISDAY that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\n\u201cI intend to work with the Oba of Benin in an arrangement that would be led by the federal government,\u201d he told THISDAY, accusing a palace chief, Elemai Oseni, of misinforming the revered monarch about his plans.\n\nHe said he would straighten out things with the monarch on his return from Germany, where he and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, are currently negotiating and insisting on unconditional repatriation of the artefacts.\n\nNotwithstanding, the brewing quarrel in Benin may become public knowledge today as Oba Ewuare II addresses a historic press conference, the first ever, signposting the importance he attaches to the issue.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the brewing crisis may replay the bitter aspect of the history of ancient Benin Kingdom dating back to 1897 when Britain invaded the kingdom, subdued Oba Ovonramwen, plundered and looted his palace and sent him on exile.\n\nA Benin chief named Obaseki, said to be the great-grandfather of the current governor, was apprehended by palace historians as one of those who betrayed Oba Ovonramwen and made the British expedition a success.\n\n\u201cThe current standoff, therefore, has a touch of history,\u201d a Benin chief told THISDAY last night, pointing out: \u201cIt is significant that another Obaseki is at play on this occasion.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered that following the imminence of the return of the looted artefacts by the UK, German and French governments, Obaseki came up with a grand plan to form a private trust, not owned by the state government, to take custody of the returning artefacts.\n\nHis plan, it is gathered, is to have the private trust build a museum of West African Arts in Benin, the state capital, where the artefacts would be kept and curated.\n\nLegacy Restoration Trust, a private entity, THISDAY learnt, has since emerged, parading itself as the authorised custodian of the artefacts.\n\nOba Ewuare II is said to have opposed this move on the ground that it would amount to private appropriation of the cultural heritage of his kingdom.\n\nWhile the monarch is said not to be opposed to the idea of the federal and state governments taking custody of the artefacts and keeping it in a museum to be built by them, he has expressed his objection to a private trust managing the ancient artworks.\n\n\u201cOba Ewuare\u2019s position,\u201d said a source, \u201cis that at the least the artefacts should return to the palace where they were stolen, contending that the palace could on its own build a museum where they would be kept and manage.\u201d\n\nThis position was well articulated in a statement by Benin Traditional Council dated 10th May 2021 and signed by the Secretary, Mr. Frank Irabor; and the Executive Assistant, Corporate and Legal Affairs, Mr. Denis Osaretin.\n\nDisowning Legacy Restoration Trust and Legacy and Legal Restoration Trust that it said had been parading themselves as presumptive custodians of the incoming artefacts, it said: \u201cFor categorical clarification, these individuals and groups of persons are not known nor authorised by the Oba of Benin, who is the original owner of the looted artefacts and the custodian of Benin customs and tradition.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpololokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, Oba of Benin remains the custodia Legis of all insignia, symbols and such other artefacts depicting the rich cultural heritage of the Benin people.\u201d\n\nIt said, the Oba of Benin or his duly authorised representative or body corporate, is, therefore, the only person that can have any dealings with any foreign donours or missions or any international institution over the artefacts.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that following this statement, the Secretary to the State Government had conversations with the palace secretary but the meeting ended in a deadlock with both parties hugging their mutually exclusive positions.\n\nAt the centre of the conflict, THISDAY has learnt, is the potentially huge financial resources that might accrue from the warehousing of the artefacts.\n\nAlready, the German government is committed to an initial donation of 4.5 million Euros to the Edo Museum of West African Arts and Cultural District projected to be built in Benin City.\n\nThis was revealed in a statement on Wednesday by Foreign Minister Maas, which spoke eloquently about the desire of Germany to return the artefacts in its custody and pay adequate reparation.\n\nObaseki too had spoken glowingly about his trust project last month after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, during which he sought the federal government\u2019s help to secure the return of the artworks.\n\nObaseki said museums had become catalysts in the evolution and development of cities.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThere is a city called Bilbao in Spain, and that was the head of the Basque separatist movements many years ago.\n\n\u201cThe investment by the Guggenheim Foundation, by the Guggenheim family museum in Bilbao, has changed the economic fortunes of that city.\n\n\u201cToday, Bilbao earns more than a billion dollars from just the presence of that museum in that city. Because everybody wants to come in to see what\u2019s in that museum.\n\n\u201cSo, bringing back these works, this world cherished works, bringing the originals back to their home, I mean, you can imagine for years to come, people, children unborn, all over the world want to come and see these pieces.\u201d\n\nHe said his administration was designing a whole cultural district for Benin, saying that the proposed museum would be situated within the cultural district.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs I speak, the planners from Latin America are in Benin City, looking at work and doing the surveys. That process should end in about August.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the museum is going to be a series of, you know, buildings, you have the pavilion where these works will be brought in initially and will be kept.\n\n\u201cWe also undertaking more archaeological excavations, and whatever we find will be kept in the pavilion.\n\n\u201cWe have a national museum that currently exists. And that\u2019s going to be refurbished, then we have the main Edo Museum of West African Arts. And the construction for that will take another one or two years to begin.\u201d\n\nOba Ewuare is, however, resisting the private trust, being promoted and led by Phillip Ihenacho, said to be Obaseki\u2019s business partner in Afrinvest, with Victor Ehikhamenor, Enotie Ogbebor, Eric Idiahi and Babatunde Adebiyi as trustees with renowned Ghanaian architect, David Adjaye as architectural consultant.\n\nTHISDAY learnt the monarch had reached out to the presidency and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, who appear to be sympathetic to the cause of having the looted artefacts returned to the palace from where they were stolen.\n\nFG Demands Unconditional Repatriation from Germany\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has urged Germany to ensure an unconditional return of the 1,130 Benin artefacts that were looted from Nigeria in the 19th century and domiciled in German museums.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, at meetings, held on Wednesday in Berlin with German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Monika Grutters, and Foreign Minister, Mr. Heiko Maas, said the return should be whole rather than substantial on the heel of remarks by Grutters that the European nation was ready to make \u201csubstantial return\u201d of the 1,130 looted artefacts.\n\nHe added that the issue of provenance, which has to do with the place of origin of the artefacts, should not be allowed to unduly delay the repatriation of the artworks.\n\n\u201cThat they are known as Benin Bronzes is already a confirmation of their source of origin (which is Benin),\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nAt a separate meeting with Maas, the minister reiterated that no conditions should be attached to the return of the artefacts.\n\nHe stressed the need for the parties to commit to definite timelines for the return of the artefacts, in addition to concluding all negotiations in a very short term.\n\nHe said the discussions between Nigeria and Germany on the return of the artworks were not the end of an era but rather the beginning of a new vista of stronger relations, pivoted by cultural diplomacy, between both countries.\n\nHe thanked Germany for taking the lead\n\nin the global efforts to repatriate all artefacts looted from Nigeria and the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe see Germany as a leader in the efforts to take practical steps to repatriate our stolen artefacts, and we hope Germany will sustain that lead,\u201d he said Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who was also on the Nigerian delegation said a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum was being built-in Benin City to house the artefacts upon their return, as part of a new cultural district in the city.\n\nHe said he was attending the talks to demonstrate the strong partnership involving the federal government, the (Benin) royal family and the people of Edo State.\n\nOn his part, the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf Tuggar, said the issue of the repatriation of the Benin Bronzes should be seen as an opportunity to take the cooperation between Nigeria and Germany to a greater height.\n\nHe commended Germany for taking the lead in the repatriation process.\n\nEarlier, the German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Grutters, had said: \u201cThe way we deal with the issue of Benin Bronzes is important to addressing our colonial past,\u201d describing the issues as \u201can important personal concern.\u201d\n\nShe assured the Nigerian delegation that the 1,130 artefacts would be returned to Nigeria from next year.\n\nShe stated that the fact that Germany had twice sent delegations to Nigeria for talks over the planned repatriation indicated that both sides had moved beyond mere talks, adding that all the museums in Germany stockpiling Benin Bronzes have agreed to cooperate.\n\nOther people on the Nigerian delegation were Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monument (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani, and Prince Ezelekhae Ewuare, who was invited by the German government.\n\nThey were later taken on a guided tour of the Humboldt-Forum, a royal palace-turned-museum in the heart of Berlin that houses art works from around the world.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*We are discussing with tax authorities, says company\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has commissioned some banks to recover N1.82 trillion from the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa (MCA).\n\nPreparatory to the collection of the amount, which is arrears of tax liabilities of the companies, the agency has also ordered that all local bank accounts of the two organisations, owners of pay television, DSTV, should be frozen.\n\nFIRS Executive Chairman, Mr. Muhammad Nami, said yesterday that the decision to appoint the banks as agents and to freeze the accounts were due to the group\u2019s continued refusal to grant FIRS access to its servers for audit.\n\nBut in a swift response, MultiChoice Nigeria said it had the media statements made by the FIRS, but had not received any notification from the agency.\n\n\u201cMultiChoice Nigeria respects and is comfortable that it complies with the tax laws of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have been and are currently in discussion with FIRS regarding their concerns and believe that we will be able to resolve the matter amicably,\u201d the company added.\n\nHowever, Nami accused the companies of breaching all agreements and undertakings with the agency and for not responding to correspondences.\n\nNami, in a statement by the Director, Communications and Liaison Department, FIRS, Mr. Abdullahi Ahmad, said Multichoice, \u201clacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records.\u201d\n\nHe added that it is important that Nigeria ends all tax frauds that have been going on for too long.\n\nAccording to him, all companies must be held accountable and made to pay their fair share of taxes, including back duty taxes owed, especially VAT for which they are ordinarily agents of collection.\n\nHe accused MultiChoice Nigeria of avoiding to give the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\n\nHe also accused the companies of being involved in the under-remittance of taxes, which necessitated a critical review of its tax-compliance level.\n\nThe statement added that the group\u2019s performance does not reflect in its tax obligations and compliance level in Nigeria.\n\nNami said: \u201cThe level of non-compliance by MultiChoice Africa (MCA), the parent company of MultiChoice Nigeria (MCN) is very alarming. The parent company, which provides services to MCN, has never paid Value Added Tax (VAT) since its inception.\n\n\u201cThe issue with tax collection in Nigeria, especially from foreign-based companies conducting businesses in Nigeria and making massive profit is frustrating and infuriating to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\n\u201cRegrettably, companies come into Nigeria just to infringe on our tax laws by indulging in tax evasion. There is no doubt that broadcasting, telecommunications, and the cable-satellite industries have changed the face of communication in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, when it comes to tax compliance, some companies are found wanting.

          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has detected a confirmed case with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as lineage B.1.617.2 in Nigeria.\n\nThe Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility A statement issued Thursday night by the Head of Communications at the NCDC, Dr. Yahaya Disu, said the variant was detected in a traveler to Nigeria, following the routine travel test required of all international travelers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja.\n\nAs part of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response, NCDC said it has been working with the Nigerian\n\nInstitute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases\n\n(ACEGID), and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic\n\nsequencing.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the detection of variants of concern, and initiate response\n\nactivities. All data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global\n\nmechanism for sharing sequencing data.\n\n\u201cGiven the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travelers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly,\u201d it said.\n\nNCDC said that given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria,\n\nall Nigerians should ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures\n\nin place.\n\nIt added, \u201cProven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent\n\nhandwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. The COVID-\n\n19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, the Centre urged states to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public, adding that public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population.\n\nAccording to the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, \u201cAlthough we have\n\nseen a low number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the last eight weeks, it is incredibly\n\nimportant that we do not forget to be careful.\n\nThe surge in cases in countries across the world and Africa is an important reminder of the risk we face. Please protect yourselves and the people you love by adhering to the known public health and social measures,\n\ngetting vaccinated if you are eligible and getting tested if you have symptoms\u201d.\n\nThe Centre said that the recommended control measures to limit the spread of the Delta variant \u201cis to continue to\n\nbe testing, following the existing public health guidance and abiding by the current travel\n\nand public restrictions\u201d.\n\nThe Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of\n\nconcern, given its increased transmissibility. The variant has been detected in over 90\n\ncountries and is expected to spread to more countries. The variant has also been linked\n\nto a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation.\n\nThere are ongoing studies to understand the impact of the variant on existing vaccines and\n\ntherapeutics.\n\nNCDC further said that government had through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC)\n\ninitiated several measures to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19.\n\nAccording to the agency this includes introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with widespread prevalence of variants of concern..\n\nIt also said that the national travel protocols including compulsory seven-day self-isolation and repeat test on the seventh day after arrival, were in place to reduce the risk of spread of the virus. It is very\n\nimportant that this is strictly adhered to, to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari and his power brokers in the All Progressives Congress (APC) have again shaded former Lagos State Governor and APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu, by approving a subtle indefinite tenure for the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Buni who had been in charge since when Adams Oshiomhole \u2013 Tinubu\u2019s loyalist \u2013 and his members were sacked in June 2020, ought to have come up with the calendar of the party\u2019s national convention, but Buhari\u2019s loyalists stated that it was not yet time.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the reluctance to announce national convention and choose national executives was to weaken the power and influence of Asiwaju in pushing for his candidates who would then begin more mobilisation for his yet-to-be-announced 2023 presidential ambition.\n\nThe development is already polarizing further the Buhari camp and the Tinubu camp in the APC, while other smaller camps have to take a stand between Buhari and Tinubu in the silent struggle.\n\n\u201cThe indefinite tenure exten\u00adsion granted to the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC is not going down well with us. Buhari has an agenda. Why keep Mala Buni over the party for this long when he has the business of a state to attend to?\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker Committee was inaugurated on June 25, 2020, and the committee should spend six months after dissolution of Oshiomhole\u2019s Nation\u00adal Working Committee. But by December, the Buhari faction in the party extended the committee tenure extended for another six months which brings it to June 20201.\n\n\u201cAgain, a week ago, the 13-member committee went to the Presidential Villa, only to be told they would be in charge indefinitely. This is against the spirit and letters of the agreement for the committee members,\u201d a source in Lags APC, familiar with the development, stated.\n\nSaharaReporters observed that while the APC weeks ago released the formal timetable for congresses from ward level to the state level, it failed to an\u00adnounce date for the national convention, a situation which means that the committee, led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State will continue in office indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe president ap\u00adproved the timetable for APC ward, local government and state congresses. Ward con\u00adgresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by local govern\u00adment congresses on 14th Au\u00adgust, 2021 and state congresses on 18th September, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we are not happy but we don\u2019t want to be seen as rocking the boat. We are just bidding our time. We are planning our own strategy too so that the effect will not be monumental on us.\n\n\u201cThis is a party we built from scratch and worked for. At this stage, we cannot allow anything to damage the plat\u00adform just because of the be\u00adhaviour of some people who are inconsiderate and power hungry,\u201d one of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists explained.\n\nSaharaReporters had first in June reported that Tinubu\u2019s obvious absence at the one-day working visit of Buhari to commission various projects in Lagos State is deepening the conflict between the camps of both political actors ahead of 2023.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that the Presidency, against its former custom, refused to extend an invitation to Tinubu ahead of the visit which should make him feel welcome at the ceremony, and the camp of the APC leader felt embarrassed by the Presidency\u2019s decision.\n\nTop sources also revealed that Tinubu did not feel comfortable to stay in Lagos during the Presidential visit in order to hide the growing battle between the two from public glare and he instead decided to embark on a journey.\n\nA political analyst, Farooq Kperogi, said on Twitter, \u201cI learned a while ago that Aso Rock didn\u2019t formally invite Tinubu to Buhari\u2019s official functions in Lagos. So, Tinubu jetted off to God knows where (someone said London) to escape public humiliation.\u201d",

But by December, the Buhari faction in the party extended the committee tenure extended for another six months which brings it to June 20201.\n\n\u201cAgain, a week ago, the 13-member committee went to the Presidential Villa, only to be told they would be in charge indefinitely. This is against the spirit and letters of the agreement for the committee members,\u201d a source in Lags APC, familiar with the development, stated.\n\nSaharaReporters observed that while the APC weeks ago released the formal timetable for congresses from ward level to the state level, it failed to an\u00adnounce date for the national convention, a situation which means that the committee, led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State will continue in office indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe president ap\u00adproved the timetable for APC ward, local government and state congresses. Ward con\u00adgresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by local govern\u00adment congresses on 14th Au\u00adgust, 2021 and state congresses on 18th September, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we are not happy but we don\u2019t want to be seen as rocking the boat. We are just bidding our time. We are planning our own strategy too so that the effect will not be monumental on us.\n\n\u201cThis is a party we built from scratch and worked for. At this stage, we cannot allow anything to damage the plat\u00adform just because of the be\u00adhaviour of some people who are inconsiderate and power hungry,\u201d one of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists explained.\n\nSaharaReporters had first in June reported that Tinubu\u2019s obvious absence at the one-day working visit of Buhari to commission various projects in Lagos State is deepening the conflict between the camps of both political actors ahead of 2023.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that the Presidency, against its former custom, refused to extend an invitation to Tinubu ahead of the visit which should make him feel welcome at the ceremony, and the camp of the APC leader felt embarrassed by the Presidency\u2019s decision.\n\nTop sources also revealed that Tinubu did not feel comfortable to stay in Lagos during the Presidential visit in order to hide the growing battle between the two from public glare and he instead decided to embark on a journey.\n\nA political analyst, Farooq Kperogi, said on Twitter, \u201cI learned a while ago that Aso Rock didn\u2019t formally invite Tinubu to Buhari\u2019s official functions in Lagos. So, Tinubu jetted off to God knows where (someone said London) to escape public humiliation.\u201d",
          "summary": "SaharaReporters gathered that the reluctance to announce national convention and choose national executives was to weaken the power and influence of Asiwaju in pushing for his candidates who would then begin more mobilisation for his yet-to-be-announced 2023 presidential ambition.\nThe development is already polarizing further the Buhari camp and the Tinubu camp in the APC, while other smaller camps have to take a stand between Buhari and Tinubu in the silent struggle.\n\u201cThe indefinite tenure exten\u00adsion granted to the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC is not going down well with us.\n\u201cThe president ap\u00adproved the timetable for APC ward, local government and state congresses.\nWard con\u00adgresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by local govern\u00adment congresses on 14th Au\u00adgust, 2021 and state congresses on 18th September, 2021.",

          "text": "On June 27, Seun Kuti, Afrobeat singer and son of the late music legend Fela Kuti, said Nigeria has witnessed at least one fuel tanker explosion every week in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe made the claim while speaking on a programme on Channels Television.\n\n\u201cEvery week this year, we have had a tanker explosion. Let me just use the tanker explosions as an instance of how the press and professionals of Nigeria continue to fail the people. Every week this year, one tanker has exploded in one place in Nigeria,\u201d Kuti said.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that one tanker even exploded right in the city of Ikeja in front of Sheraton Hotel, killed people and destroyed businesses there. You will never hear the media say: \u2018Billionaire owners of tankers are killing Nigerians or \u2018Billionaire tanker owners are terrorists\u2019.

          "title": "Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures",
          "text": "On April 29, Mayowa, 32, was distraught when he couldn\u2019t pay for a 19km Uber ride he had taken to visit a friend in Park View Estate, a well known residential community in the highbrow area of Ikoyi, Lagos. His orange branded Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) app had not launched as he tried severally to make a transfer from his current account to the empty savings account linked to the debit card on his Uber app.\n\nThinking his MTN data service was the problem, he tried punching his bank\u2019s *737# short code to make the transfer but he got an unresponsive code message.\n\nHe tried again, and again and again without success. Frustrated, he made a last attempt accessing his account through GTB\u2019s mobile website, but it took forever to load. To make matters worse, Mayowa\u2019s buddy was away from home, at a dragging management meeting and wouldn\u2019t pick up his frantic calls.\n\n\u201cTen minutes had passed by now. The Uber driver was looking at me funny. It was embarrassing. I had to plead with him to have some patience,\u201d a laughing Mayowa shared.\n\nOut of Service\n\nMayowa is one of many GTB customers who suffered embarrassment, inconvenience or loss of opportunity, as downtimes on the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking services became frequent in the first half of 2021, sometimes stretching days on end.\n\n@gtbank why is your bank frustrating customers? I have not been able to access my GT Mobile App for days now. And when money is sent to my account I don't receive alert be it SMS or Email alert.\n\nI recharged 1k few days ago I was debited, but my phone wasn't credited. \u2014 Precious Oye (@BarrypOye) April 30, 2021\n\nWhat is going on @gtbank_help. I am fed up with you guys @gtbank. Everything is stressful.\n\nWhy have I been experiencing this all evening \ud83d\ude29? Now it's CT11, no more E150.\n\nI am starting to tire of your channels pic.twitter.com/cmLjiiaiEL \u2014 Dr. Ameena (@amkmusty) March 22, 2021\n\nAn employee explained that the E105 and CT11 error codes pop up when a partner firm Clickatell\u2019s server is down or GTB\u2019s API is unreachable to initiate the transaction\n\nBuying airtime on @gtbank app is just pure scam, they would deduct the money n not deliver the airtime and I\u2019m just tired of complaining. \u2014 Abbie \ud83d\udc3e (@Abigailsluvv) June 16, 2021\n\nHow can GTB be silent at a time like this? I know they can see the complaints. Do traditional Nigerian banks no longer care about proving quality customer support & help? Tomorrow, they will still charge us a silly \u2018convenience\u2019 fee \ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Koromone Koroye (@Koromone_K) April 29, 2021\n\nA comparative analysis conducted by TC Insights, of customer complaints on Twitter about the mobile app and USSD services between the first half of 2020 and 2021, showed a 54% spike.\n\nA customer representative with the company explained under anonymity that most of the complaints this year have been about the USSD platform, mobile application, unexplainable SMS charges and lately, One Time Password (OTP) issues.\n\n\u201cThese are the recurring problems and complaints. Just ask any GTB customer. They will share some bitter experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nSeven years ago, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria\u2019s third-largest lender, pioneered mobile banking with its *737# USSD service in Nigeria, introducing a new level of ease to customers.\n\nToday, other banks have adopted it and an estimated 40 million Nigerians use USSD services for mobile banking. According to the GTB\u2019s financial report, its revenue from USSD fees was \u20a62.13 billion ($5.3m) in 2019, a significant 34% increase from the \u20a61.58 billion ($3.9m) made in 2018.\n\nGTB didn\u2019t reveal its USSD revenue for 2020 but it disclosed that the total amount it processed via USSD was \u20a63.89 trillion, a 9.4% increase from the \u20a63.55 trillion processed in 2019. Its mobile app also has over a million downloads on the Google play store alone.\n\nStaff churn and delayed promotions\n\nTechCabal has learnt, from interviews with 19 former and current employees of the bank\u2019s IT division, that the division has suffered a spike in attrition within the last six months. It has resulted in technical gaps and work overload for current employees.\n\nAccording to these sources, the absence of promotions in 2020 for already overworked employees who felt they were deserving triggered the first wave of exits into the labour market which had attractive offers for their talent. The workforce shortage cascaded into increased workload and mounting pressure for the remaining division employees.\n\nAt least ten team members resigned this year from the application development team, a unit which often consists of 20 members, according to a former software developer with the bank .\n\n\u201cI was handling one application then it doubled as a result,\u201d Stanley* said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a particular team where three members left in the space of one month. Now, four people\u2019s responsibilities are being juggled by one person,\u201d another employee, at the time of the interview in May, shared.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is crazy. One person is doing three people\u2019s jobs all in the name of efficiency. That\u2019s why our cost to income ratio will always be the lowest in the industry,\u201d Michael*, an ex-employee exclaimed.\n\nGTB\u2019s operating expense increased by \u20a616.5bn from its 2019 figure (\u20a6131bn) due to additional investment in technology to enable staff to work from home and costs associated with implementing safety procedures as well as COVID 19 protocols.\n\nThe frequent loss of experienced talents without a commensurate hiring rate resulted in gaps in technical capabilities, a source explained.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe application I am managing was handled by two people, but my partner has gone to join another team. If I\u2019m leaving now, a new person can\u2019t cram and get a good grip of everything in my handover note within 3 weeks. We simply need more people on the team!\u201d\n\nThis gap is often reflected when there is a service downtime towards the end of the month caused by server overload. During this period, transaction volume increases due to salary payments and other month-end payments, leading to more pressure on existing resources.\n\nAccording to sources, towards the end of the month, experienced hands would usually be proactive in tracking certain metrics and moving different applications across servers to ensure there\u2019s space for the surge. But in the absence of such hands, performance management and quality control suffer.\n\nTechCabal contacted Guaranty Trust Bank for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough\n\nThe bank appears to have taken some steps to solve at least part of the problem that have caused recurring transaction problems this year.\n\nOn June 2nd, 2021 about 900 staff of GTB received a long overdue announcement: they had been promoted. It offered some consolation to many who had been expecting for a while.\n\nHowever, a software developer who was promoted made it clear that this promotion won\u2019t serve as a solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still understaffed. The App development team is almost half of what it was at the beginning of the year. They haven\u2019t replaced people. Some people even got promoted but left because they don\u2019t want the stress again,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu*, a mid-level associate disclosed that complaints have been made to line managers who encouraged the units and explained that recruitments are ongoing for entry-level and experienced hands who will begin resuming from July.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s wait and see\u201d, he said.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\n$1 = \u20a6 400\n\nWritten by Staff Writer Daniel Adeyemi and Editor-in-Chief Adegoke Oyeniyi @seunadegoke01\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peter Njonjo wants to change the way food moves in Africa",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nPeter Njonjo started his first business in high school. He noticed a problem; the school canteen was too far from the dormitories.\n\nEvery day, he and his classmates made the tiresome journey from their beds to the canteen to buy bread. Peter\u2019s solution was simple \u2013 buy all of the bread in the canteen, bring it to the dormitories, sell to customers from the comfort of their beds and charge a small fee for this convenience.\n\n\u201cI built a very successful franchise because there were many dormitories so I couldn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said to me during our call.\n\nToday, he is solving a similar problem on a much larger scale. He is the CEO and co-founder of Twiga Foods, a company that is taking fresh and processed foods from over 4,000 farmers and manufacturers who are often far away and delivering to more than 35,000 vendors across Kenya \u2013 while charging a small fee for this convenience.\n\nFrom having an incomplete MBA to heading Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across 33 African countries, his story is one of a man who is passionate about making the lives of people just a little easier.\n\nHis name is Peter Njonjo and this is his life in tech.\n\nPeter Njonjo and the case of the incomplete MBA\n\nIf you scroll down to the Education section of Peter Njonjo\u2019s LinkedIn page today you would find an entry for an MBA in Strategic Management from the year 2000 and right below it are the words \u201cMasters Incomplete\u201d.\n\nDuring our call, Peter tells me that he completed the coursework required to get the MBA. The incompleteness would boil down to his final MBA paper and the professor who was in charge of it. Put simply, they were not very cooperative.\n\n\u201cThey were very fussy, they were always changing their minds. And I was very busy.\u201d\n\nYou may ask what could have made a 21-year old Peter too busy to focus all his time on placating his professor \u2013 his job at Coca-Cola.\n\nAround the time when he applied for his master\u2019s program, Peter was also starting a job as an accountant in Coca-Cola with his newly minted degree in finance \u2013 which he had gotten in nine months.\n\n\u201cSo many people have stories of growing up in university and all the partying. For me, it just passed so quickly and I was always in the library.\u201d\n\nDuring the typical two-year window between high school and university, Peter decided to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In that time he made considerable progress. He chose to attend the United States International University Africa (USIUA), a private university in Nairobi.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the work I\u2019d done during my CPA, my undergraduate lasted nine months.\u201d\n\nHis fizzy rise to the top at Coca-Cola\n\nIn 1998, Peter Njonjo was one of the youngest CPAs in the entire country. He joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in that same year and his first task on the job was to reconcile some accounts that just wouldn\u2019t balance.\n\n\u201cI spent very very long hours trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut that was only the start of his 18-year career at the company.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of people who worked in Coca-Cola, the tenures are very long. It\u2019s a company where if your DNA matches that of the company, there are a lot of opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAnd Peter was taking as many of these opportunities as he could. For him, it was a case of being an entrepreneur within an existing organisation and owning processes. He was, as he puts it, \u201cusing other people\u2019s money to create value\u201d. This approach endeared him to a lot of people early on and helped to advance him through the ranks so that by the time he turned 31, after 10 years in the company, he became country manager for Kenya.\n\nThree years later, he would be in charge of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in six countries across East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique. In this time, he would put together deals worth more than a billion dollars in CapEx (Capital Expenditure).\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t slowing down. During his time as general manager of Coca-Cola East Africa, he started his own company with his co-founder and friend Grant Brooke.\n\nTwiga Foods was not the first business they would try to run together. Their first had been a business that involved felling timber and replenishing the plantation where they got the timber from. The business did not work out.\n\nSometime later, Grant came to Peter with an idea. He wanted them to sell bananas.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was like \u2018Oh God, this doesn\u2019t sound like one of those things I want to be involved in for the long term. But let me just listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd listen he did.\n\nGoing bananas and starting Twiga\n\nA fun fact that would help Peter Njonjo take the leap into the world of bananas is that bananas are one of the biggest traded commodities in the world.\n\nSo the plan was to export bananas. But that was far from a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the supply chains were so broken and there were so many challenges out there. It was not going to be as straightforward as we thought.\u201d\n\nWhen they were unable to sell even one container outside of Kenya, Peter felt it was time for them to sell the bananas locally. But even there, they met broken supply chains that made it hard for them to create any value as many parts of the retail industry was fragmented and informal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to formalise something that\u2019s informal, you\u2019ll encounter all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of those challenges was the absence of a standard for packaging produce. This made it hard for a business like theirs to calculate their gross profit margin per unit because, effectively, the concept of a unit in the market was foreign.\n\n\u201cSo we had to introduce bananas with crates and teach people that you can actually by bananas in crates and buy them ripened instead of buying them and ripening yourself and losing half of it.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of tweaking Twiga\u2019s business model and figuring out the best way to create value, Grant ran the business while Peter sat on the board and helped direct the business. He also continued to rise through the ranks at Coca-Cola, eventually becoming President of Coca-Cola West and Central Africa overseeing 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. He would leave this role in 2019 to become CEO of Twiga Foods.\n\n\u201cI had discussed with Grant that if the business ever became too big, then I would be happy to step in. Because, for me, it was a major investment.\u201d\n\nIt was such a big investment for him that while they made attempts to raise more capital for the business, he and his wife decided to sell the home they had built to finance the business in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my wife\u2019s idea. We had a term sheet from the lead investor but the due diligence was taking time and I was afraid the company would run out of money before the round closed.\u201d\n\nBut according to Peter, they were fairly confident about where the business was going and so it made sense for them. They would eventually close a $1.75 million seed round.\n\n\u201cAnd I think one of the things you can learn is don\u2019t get too attached to material assets. Instead, focus on legacy and the things you need to build.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, play Legacy by Jay-Z\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 45 this year. I was born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya. I\u2019m the firstborn of four children.\u201d\n\nThat is how Peter Njonjo starts his story on our call. He and his siblings were born to their mother, a retired accountant who is now involved in the family business, and their father, an engineer who is still active in the real estate market.\n\nPeter and his wife Tina have four children. When I ask him about what personal plans he has for him and his family he said, \u201cEnsuring that I\u2019m there for my kids as they grow up and enjoying my marriage with my wife and figuring out things we can pursue that are tied to our passions; be it philanthropy or angel investing.\u201d\n\nFor Twiga, big plans abound as well. In September the company plans to commission the largest standalone banana ripening facility in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good amount of time fine-tuning our business here in Kenya so that should help us scale fast. In the next five years, we want to be in 12 countries on the continent, serving about 100,000 customers a day.\u201d\n\nWith the success it has already recorded in Kenya, Twiga Foods is well on its way to achieving these goals.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Thursday said it has directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA), in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nMultiChoice Group is a South African entertainment giant and owner of the popular DStv and GOtv services. Its operations in more than 20 other African countries contribute up to a third of the company\u2019s revenues, with Nigeria being the largest market.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, accused the company of persistently breaching all agreements and undertakings with the tax agency. MultiChoice also allegedly denied access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\u201cThe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,\u201d the executive chair of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company. Particularly, [MultiChoice Nigeria Limited] has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income,\u201d he said.\n\nNami revealed that the revenue service has now instructed banks to sweep the balances in MultiChoice Africa and MultiChioce Nigeria\u2019s accounts before carrying out any other transaction on behalf of the companies. \u201cIt is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe MultiChoice Group reports revenues in primarily two segments \u2013 South Africa and the rest of Africa. According to the FIRS chair, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, MultiChoice\u2019s latest results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nThe Group, in a statement responding to the accusations, said it had not been formally notified about the matter and the case appeared to be based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,\u201d it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.\n\nMultiChoice is the latest South African firm involved in a huge tax scandal in Nigeria. In 2018, the Nigerian unit of MTN Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to the importation of equipment and payments to foreign suppliers from 2007 to 2017. Though the tax demand was eventually dropped.\n\nBeing one of DStv\u2019s biggest markets, the tax dispute in Nigeria could significantly disrupt the operations of MultiChoice if it is not resolved quickly.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "title": "International Passport New Regime 2021 \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Federal Government has said it is turning around the entire passport application process by the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) to Six weeks timeline from 1st of June, 2021, so as to ensure seamless, transparent, as well as according human dignity to applicants and fulfil citizenship integrity, in line with the mandate of the Ministry of Interior. There is a new passport regime that is driven by technology.\n\nThe minister of interior Rauf Aregbesola has hinged the future of ISSUANCE OF PASSPORTS in Nigeria to technology. Aregbesola noted that giving the critical role ICT will play in the work of the Service; the ministry has launched an IT solution that has simplified ISSUANCE OF PASSPORTS. According to him, this IT solution \u201cwill ensure that all Nigerians carryout registration, without visiting any of immigration offices. This solution can be used anywhere in the world. From the time you register with immigration online. Aregbesola has predicted that technology would play a major role in the future of the issuance of passport. Technology seems to dictate the speed at which life is changing.\n\nAregbesola is considering the benefit from online passport application roll out. It is designed to improve efficiency and convenience by providing a modern and secure service to millions of passport holders and applicants. The service means applicants can upload a suitable digital photo from their smartphone or tablet, making applying for a passport quick and simple. In total, the whole process takes 10 minutes.\n\nAregbesola is introducing a host of new tech projects under issuance of passport, and he hopes to complete and implement most of these very soon. The most crucial one, already in its pilot stages, is the integration.\n\nIntegration with the database that can make verification a much less tedious task for the passport authorities, This integration will help Nigerians with establishing identity by verifying even the biometric match.\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola has disclosed that:\n\n\u201cWe have created special centres for expedited services. These special centres will run on public-private partnership basis. This has already taken off in Abuja and 10 more will be opened in coming weeks as more of such centres will be opened all over the country. Our goal is to have one in each local government, university campuses, institutions of higher learning and other places.\n\nA timeline will be fixed for every application i.e., a collection date. This will be six weeks, comparable to what obtains in other countries. This is to allow for enough time to investigate and validate personal information supplied by the applicants. What we are driving at is the peace of mind that comes from assurance of certainty. If there are circumstances that will make the date to change, it will be communicated to the applicant one week before the collection date.\n\nApplicants will have no basis for further communication with officers, other than to complete their application process and leave the venue. The date for the collection of their passports or any challenge to the application, will be communicated to them. The technology for the efficient running of this system has been acquired and will be deployed.\n\nWe are publishing on our website the list of the backlog of passports that are ready which are yet to be collected by the owners. They will be required to go to the state commands to collect them.\u201d\n\nTo permanently curb the complaints of difficulty in obtaining Passports from the NIS, Aregbesola has came up with several innovations that all pending passports will be Issued on or before May 31st, 2021 and starting from June 1, 2021, a new regime will begin. It has become imperative that we review our operations and rejig our system, in order to be able to offer excellent services to our clients. We need to review a system from time to time to see if it helps best to serve and realise the objectives. One, Aregbesola has declared a zero-tolerance stance to all forms of touting. No applicant will be made to pay any illegitimate fees. We are going to embed security operatives \u2013 seen and unseen \u2013 in all our passport offices. They will wear body cameras.\n\nThe Federal Government has said that at least 45,000 Passport Booklets are yet to be collected by applicants at the various Nigeria Immigration Service enrolment centres worldwide. This is coming as the government extends the deadline for clearing Passport Backlog initially for 31st May by one week. The new date for the beginning of the new Passport Regime is now June 8. At a review meeting with the management of the Service, it was revealed that 230,000 Passport Booklets have been produced so far and members of the public enjoined to visit their enrolment centres for collection.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola had at a meeting with Passport Control Officers and Attaches of the Service from across the world on April 22 rejigged the Passport Application Processing by announcing sweeping reforms. However, before the beginning of the new passport processing regime, a promise was made to Nigerians to clear all passport backlog.\n\nMinister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola, has said through a public-private partnership, government would establish at least one special centre in each local government area, beginning with Abuja, to speed up passport processing.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Abuja\n\n...",

          "title": "OBITUARY: The controversial life of Africa\u2019s most influential preacher, T.B. Joshua",
          "text": "Temitope Balogun Joshua epitomised the aspiration of every lowly roadside Evangelical preacher or a small-time pastor, ensconced in a small claustrophobia store or makeshift hut, whose voice and importance are amplified a hundred folds by the usually an oversized megaphone.\n\nFor such preachers, their dreams are usually the same \u2013 grow the sprinkle of devout worshippers who attend services at their usually austere places of worship into a multitude of ardent followers from all parts of the world.\n\nThey dream of becoming mega-preachers or admired televangelists with millions tuning in to hear them speak from lavishly furnished altars laid inside their gleaming religious edifices.\n\nSuch preachers want to replace their ascetic garbs with custom-made designer apparel, own expensive automobiles, usually driven in convoys with screaming sirens, ensuring they do not go through the tortuous inconveniences of ordinary people like sitting in traffic.\n\nSome of them dream of, perhaps, owning private jets. They dream of ditching their usually rustic mannerism and accents for something more cosmopolitan. They want the good life. Why not? Even, Jesus, had his feet daubed with a jar of expensive perfumed oil.\n\nHowever, like the seeds in the bag of the sower in that Gospel\u2019s allegory, some of these dreams will fall on the path and will be snatched by birds before they even have time to grow. Some of them will fall on rocky ground, devoid of enough soil for sustenance and they will be soon withered and die. Others will fall on among thorns and will be asphyxiated, bearing no fruit.\n\nA few like T.B. Joshua\u2019s, will fall on fertile ground, grow into robust crops, yielding grains in hundredfold.\n\nT.B. Joshua, as he was commonly known, was born into a Christian family on June 12, 1963, in the small town of Arigidi, Ondo State, South-west Nigeria. He started reading the Bible as a child. He told the Guardian Newspaper in 2019 that, at age six, he had finished reading the Bible from start to finish, twice.\n\n\u201cMy interest in the subject grew to the extent that I could read the whole Bible on the average of two months during my secondary school days. I was also the leader of the Scripture Union (SU) of my school,\u201d he said.\n\nT.B. Joshua dropped out of secondary school.\n\nHe admitted, in the same interview with the Guardian newspaper, that he did not have a head for books. Later in life, he tried to go back to school, he just could not cope, until he ditched the idea.\n\nAlso, he tried to join the Nigeria Army but could not make it to his interview at the defence academy in Kaduna on time because a train he was travelling in broke down at Jebba, in Kwara State.\n\nThe Young T.B. Joshua wanted more from life than what it offered at Arigidi, so he left home in a \u201cbolekaja\u201d truck transporting farm produce to Lagos. The trip was slow, perhaps because bolekaja trucks were usually sluggish, rickety, and broke down regularly. He said he spent five days on the road from Arigidi Akoko to Lagos.\n\nT.B. Joshua arrived at the popular Mile 12 food market in Lagos and worked for a few days, washing the feet of traders as they left the muddy market before he left to join his sister in Ikotun -Egbe. He did a series of other menial jobs including working on a poultry farm. He did not find fulfilment doing menial jobs, if he was going to live a life of working menial work, he would have stayed back in rural Arigidi.\n\nDesolate about his future, T.B Joshua switched to his first love- religion. He briefly served as a junior prophet at a parish of the Celestial Christian Church of God, a Christian sect founded in 1948 in the Benin Republic, whose adherents adorns white flowing robes and are required to be barefooted when dressed in the white garment.\n\nMembers of Cele, as the church is commonly known, are often scorned by other Christians because of their syncretic doctrine, which encourages the burning of candles, the use of seawater, palm frond, going into trance to prophesy, and elements of animism and sacrifices like practices in traditional African religion.\n\nClearly, T.B. Joshua\u2019s sojourn as a prophet in the Celestial Church of God influenced the doctrine of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN). The use of white garments, in the early days, in the early days of SCOAN was apparent as T.B. Joshua primarily adorned white clothing.\n\nHowever, they were not usually made into robes (in the styles of the Cele church).\n\nAlso was exorcism and his claim that his holy water could cure sundry ailments such as HIV and Ebola. (There were no independent authentications of these claims).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Early Days of SCOAN\n\nIn 1987, T.B. Joshua founded SCOAN. It started as an eight-man congregation, which grew rapidly, thanks to T.B. Joshua\u2019s acclaimed prophetic gift and miracle healings.\n\nLike most religious upstarts, T.B. Joshua and his pioneer members worshipped in makeshift accommodations. The church moved a lot in its early days, mainly because it was often flooded, (not surprising as Ikotun was a swampy backwater Lagos neighbourhood) and the need for bigger spaces as his congregants grew.\n\nBy the time it moved to its current location, in 1994, it had changed locations four times.\n\nEven before the virality of social media, T.B. Joshua understood the power of the media and meticulously documented how he rebuilt the churches after each flooding episode. There are still videos on Youtube of a scruffy looking T.B. Joshua lifting woods, bricks, and sand as he rebuilt the usually ramshackle edifices of his early church.\n\nThe videos also depicted him as a man of the people who ate with his followers. (One video showed him queuing to buy yam and beans worth N5, which was served in plastic utensils). Another showed him washing a toilet used by his congregants with a straw broom.\n\nAfter Sunday services, he was escorted out of the church by a crowd of his members as he takes a commercial motorcycle to his praying and personal sanctuary in Agodo-Egbe, a nearby island.\n\nThe Scandals\n\nAs T.B. Joshua\u2019s popularity soared, so did the scandals. A former disciple of the prophet, Bisola Johnson, wrote a book \u2013 (The T.B Joshua I know \u2013 Deception of the Age Unmasked) and granted several interviews where he accused T.B. Joshua of sexual slavery and sundry allegations including manipulation, diabolism, deceit, and contrived miracles.\n\nLate broadcaster and investigative journalist, Kola Olawuyi, in the late 1990s, ran a series on his Nkan Mbe radio programme, where he spoke to several former backroom staff and members of the SCOAN who revealed all manners of alleged atrocities including occultism at the church.\n\nThe scandals even trailed T.B. Joshua beyond the borders of the country, The Cameroonian government placed a ban on his church in the country in 2012, describing him as \u201cdiabolical\u201d in a statement titled \u201cThe Devil in the House\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Cameroonian Government warns these pilgrims that they will face the consequences alone. This is motivated by the painful and shameful fact that Cameroonian men and women, in search of deliverance and blessings, once in that church, find themselves in bestial and pitiable conditions,\u201d the statement signed by the country\u2019s foreign minister at the time, Henri Eyebe Ayissi, read.\n\nHe was also accused of causing the death of several HIV and AIDS patients who thronged to his church for faith healing after he discouraged them from taking their medication or the claim that his holy water has healed them of the ailment.\n\nIn 2016, PREMIUM TIMES revealed that T.B Joshua and his wife had incorporated a shell company, Chillon Consultancy Limited, on June 20, 2006, at the British Virgin Island (BVI), a notorious offshore tax haven. The clergy dismissed the story as false. However, this newspaper published original documents he submitted while registering the company, in a follow-up story.\n\nThe Collapsed Building\n\nWithout a doubt, the biggest scandal that trailed T.B. Joshua was on September 12, 2014, when a refurbished guesthouse within his church collapsed, killing 116 people, most of them South Africans, who had travelled to the Ikotun- Egbe headquarters of his church for pilgrimage.\n\nThough T.B Joshua suggested that the collapse was caused by an explosion from a bomb purportedly planted by Boko Haram terrorists (the church also suggested that a low-flying aircraft which flew past the church premises moments before the building collapsed might have been responsible), officials of the Lagos State building regulatory agency stated that the church did not seek requisite approval before adding more floors on the collapsed guesthouse.\n\nIt was later revealed that T.B Joshua bribed some journalists who covered the tragedy with N50,000 each to report the incident with a slant that presents the church in good light.\n\nT.B Joshua refused to attend the coroner\u2019s inquest organised by the state government to reveal how the victims died, despite being invited multiple times.\n\nReligious Tourism and Ikotun-Egbe Economy\n\nBefore SCOAN, Ikotun Egbe was a mostly swampy, often forgotten, backwater of Lagos. T.B. Joshua is, without a doubt. the biggest singular accelerator of development in the neighbourhood. With tens of thousands of pilgrims from mainly Southern African countries and all over the world visiting his church yearly, the economy of the area grew faster than many parts of Lagos. Small businesses providing ancillary services to the pilgrims sprung faster than trees planted by the river.\n\nResidential buildings were turned into commercial centres, malls and hotels catering to the needs of the unending flow of pilgrims from all over the world. So much was his influence in the area and beyond that in 2017 when he suggested he was going to move his church to Israel, it elicited a statement from the state government appealing that he should reconsider his decision.\n\nA former staff of one of Nigeria\u2019s leading airlines told PREMIUM TIMES that his church was one of the biggest money-spinners for Nigerian airlines, and in fact, several airlines from other places, that fly pilgrims from all over the world to Lagos.\n\nThe biggest propagator of T.B Joshua\u2019s evangelism is his Emmanuel TV, arguably the most-watched Christian television channel in the world. With the help of the station, which is mostly run by foreign members of his church, he reached millions of his supporters worldwide. Emmanuel TV YouTube page, which was recently suspended for posting homophobic content, was one of the most subscribed religious channels in the world, with over 1 million subscribers.\n\nThe philanthropist and lover of sports\n\nApart from his religious activities, T.B Joshua catered for the physical and material needs of people around the world. His humanitarian giving spanned beyond the country\u2019s borders into countries like Haiti, Pakistan, Ghana, Zimbabwe Ecuador, and several other places.\n\nHe is also very popular among the community of physically challenged people in Nigeria for his philanthropy. He is reported to have several scholarship programmes for indigent students across Africa, some of who he sponsored to institutions of tertiary learning abroad.\n\nT.B. Joshua often hands food items and bundles of cash gifts to people he purportedly healed or exorcised of demons during his services.\n\nHis philanthropy is only matched by his love for sports, especially football. He is the proprietor of My People Football Club, a Lagos based football club he founded in 2008. Notable among members of the team, who rose to national prominence, are \u2013 Ogenyi Onazi and Sani Emmanuel.\n\nHe was reported to have supported individual players with funds and claimed to have helped heal the injuries of some notable national football stars such as Joseph Yobo and Kanu Nwankwo, who once visited his church for faith healings. Many of them, however, subsequently got proper healings from subsequent medical procedures.\n\nHe was also popular with African movie stars.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most influential preacher\n\nLike many evangelical preachers, T.B Joshua regularly foretold political events. This has helped endeared him to political leaders across Africa.\n\nIn 2009, days after his victory in the country\u2019s presidential election, late Ghanaian president John Atta Mills, flew to Nigeria for a thanksgiving service at the Synagogue Church. Mr Mills said the preacher had accurately predicted his victory at the poll.\n\nT.B. Joshua was scorned by majority of Nigerian evangelical Christians, who are often uncomfortable with his doctrine, which they consider too syncretic and in fact, occultic to be have been ordained by God.\n\nHe was the source of a bitter feud between two of Nigeria\u2019s televangelists, Chris Oyakhilome of Christ Embassy and Chris Okotie of the Household of God in the early 2000s. Mr Okotie had reprimanded Mr Oyakhilome for fraternising with T.B. Joshua, who he described as \u201cthe vicar of the devil on earth\u201d.\n\nT.B. Joshua was as controversial as he was influential, eliciting extreme love in others the same way the mention of his name in some quarters, provoked resentment.\n\nHe died suddenly on June 5, 2012, a week before his 58th birthday. He was survived by his wife Evelyn and three daughters. He will be buried today in Lagos.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Agbeja\n\nCommissioner of Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) Akin Olateru on Thursday in Abuja said the preliminary report on the recent Nigerian Air Force (NAF) aircraft crash in Kaduna would be ready in a week.\n\nOlateru made the announcement at the release of eight accident reports which covered 2010 and 2019.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that A Beechcraft 350, belonging to the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), crashed around the Kaduna International Airport on May 21.\n\nGen. Ibrahim Attahiru, Chief of Army Staff, and 10 other military personnel perished in the crashed helicopter.\n\nAttahiru was on his way to Kaduna to attend the Passing-Out Parade of army recruits which was scheduled for the following day.\n\nOlateru, who said AIB had analysed the aircraft\u2019s flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), maintained that only the military has the authority to disclose the content of the preliminary report.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t speak for the military, we don\u2019t have mandate to report outcome of accident or incidence relating to NAF aircraft. Our mandate is limited to civil aviation. Military aviation is different from civil aviation.\n\n\u201cBut we are privileged to be called upon, which to me, will help the civil aspect of the incident because the accident happened at a civil airport.\n\n\u201cSo there are aspects of it we need to look at, the final response of the fire engine, the prevailing weather, what actually happened. What part the ATC play? These are all civil.\n\n\u201cWe cannot determine whether Nigerians will want the preliminary report or all the findings to be published. That is beyond our mandate, it is only Nigerian Air Force that can do that\u201c he said.\n\nAccording to him, despite the paralyzing effects of COVID-19, the bureau had remained committed to its mandate by working all through the pandemic to clear outstanding reports.\n\nThe commissioner said one of the reports was classified as \u201caccident\u201c while the remaining seven were serious \u201cincidents\u201c.\n\nHe said the bureau had released a total of 69 reports and 220 safety recommendations since its creation in 2007, pointing out that 48 reports and 139 safety recommendations were made under the present administration.\n\nHe added that the eight reports being released were with a total of nine safety recommendations which were addressed to the regulatory body, the affected airlines and the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), among others.\n\nThe commissioner said there were international dimensions to two of the reports which involved a Turkish plane and an Arik Air plane in Accra, Ghana.\n\n\u201cReports being released today are Report on serious incident involving a B737-500 aircraft operated by Air Peace Limited with nationality and registration marks 5N-BRN, which occurred at Port Harcout Airport, Omagwa, Rivers on 22nd June, 2019.\n\n\u201cReport on the serious incident involving HS-125- 700A aircraft operated by Associated Aviation Limited with nationality and registration marks 5N-BEX, which occurred at Benin Airport, Edo state, Nigeria on May 10, 2011.\n\n\u201cReport on the serious incident involving a B737-200 aircraft with nationality and registration marks 5N-BIF owned and operated by Chanchagi Airlines, which occurred at Kaduna Airport, Runway 05, Kaduna State, Nigeria on Aug. 20, 2010.\n\n\u201cReport on serious incident involving a Bombardier DHC-8-Q400 aircraft owned and operated by Arik Air Nigeria Limited with nationality and registration marks 5N-BKX which occurred en route Kotoka International Airport, Accra, Ghana, on March 6, 2018,\u201c it said.\n\nAnother is a report on the serious incident involving a Boeing 737-500 aircraft operated by Med-View Airline with nationality and registration marks 5N-BQM, which occurred at FL320 en route Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos on July 23, 2019.\n\nHe also mentioned a report on the accident involving a Hawker Siddeley HS-125-800 XP aircraft owned and operated by SWAT Technology Limited with nationality and registration marked N497AG.\n\nHe said it occurred on Runway 21, Port Harcourt Airport, Omagwa, Rivers State on June 11, 2015.\n\nThe commissioner said there was also a report on the serious incident involving an Airbus 330-343 aircraft owned and operated by Turkish Airline Inc. with nationality and registration marks TC-LOL.\n\nHe said it occurred at Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa, Rivers State, Nigeria on Dec. 31, 2019.\n\nHe said there was a report on the serious incident Boeing 737-300 aircraft owned and operated by Air Peace Limited with nationality and registration mark 5N-BUK.\n\nHe said it occurred at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, on May 15, 2019.\n\n\u201c I will enjoin media and interested members of the public to check our website (www.aib.gov.ng) for the details of all the reports,\u201c he said.",

          "title": "CDS Irabor on insurgency fight, others: We can\u2019t use old tools to defeat new threats",
          "text": "Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor has said old weapons and tactics have become unsuitable to defeat asymmetric warfare like Boko Haram insurgency, kidnapping, banditry and related crimes.\n\nThe CDS noted that long-term success against terrorism, insurgency, banditry and other internal security challenges required a total approach rather than just a military solution.\n\nTo this end, he said the military had resolved to acquire new platforms to address them adequately.\n\nNigeria has been in the throes of the insurgency fight in the North-east for over a decade, a development that has become worrisome to citizens, government and the international community.\n\nThe challenge was later to be compounded by banditry, kidnapping and a myriad of other security issues.\n\nThe defence chief spoke less than 24 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari openly admitted inadequate equipment and funding of troops, while also canvassing a change in tactics in the insurgency fight and others.\n\nPresident Buhari spoke when he decorated the new army chief, Farouk Yahaya with the new rank of lieutenant general Wednesday.\n\nIrabor speaks\n\nAnd addressing a regimental dinner organised in honour of the graduating students of Senior Course 43 of Armed Forces Command and Staff College Jaji, Kaduna state Wednesday, CDS Irabor said it\u2019s high time the military changed its tactics to address the nonconventional warfare like insurgency.\n\nThe graduating students, in the ranks of Major and its equivalents are to assume new responsibilities as mid-level commanders.\n\nAddressing the gathering, General Irabor said the involvement of military in containing asymmetric security threats in the past few years had highlighted the need to acquire new operational capability for the Armed Forces of Nigeria to deal with emergent threats.\n\nHe said: \u201cAccordingly, we are developing new capabilities in intelligence and surveillance, which are critical for staying ahead of terrorists and insurgents, and other criminal elements in the society.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, asymmetric warfare encourages the use of non-traditional military tactics for which our previous training and operational doctrines were not well suited. Nigeria is currently contending with a number of asymmetric threats. The most visible of these threats is the terrorism and insurgency by the Boko Haram in the North-East.\n\n\u201cEqually disturbing is the herders-farmers conflicts in some parts of the country, which recently have attained a worrisome dimension with different interpretations of the causes of the conflict and personalities involved. This is coupled with other varying acts of criminalities that are characterised by banditry, kidnapping among others. The involvement of the armed forces in the management of such internal crises requires a complex interplay of many factors.\n\n\u201cAs mid-level commanders, your role becomes even more challenging when operating in an operational environment that is intricately woven and influenced by many factors and several differing actors, most of which are not defined by military necessities. Expectedly, such complex security environment will require new capabilities and also portend several challenges to military and security practitioners.\n\n\u201cOne major success determinant in a complex security environment is for you to have a thorough understanding of the dynamics that define the crisis you are deployed to contain, and the interplay of the various actors. This understanding will ensure that you exhibit clear thought and adequate judgement in decision making even when under pressure. It will also guide you from the manipulative tendencies of some parties to the conflict.\n\n\u201cYou must remember that as a commander, and indeed as a member of the armed forces, you are required to be apolitical and neutral in your decision making and subsequent actions.\u201d\n\nOn the steps taken by the military command to address new threats, General Irabor said: \u201cThe curriculum of our training institutions across the services are constantly being reviewed and our new platform acquisitions are being focused to acquire new set of capabilities that address asymmetric threats. We cannot use old tools to address new threats.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we are developing new capabilities in intelligence and surveillance, which are critical for staying ahead of terrorists and insurgents, and other criminal elements in the society.\n\n\u201cThe Defence Headquarters as well as the services are utilising their Special Forces Units, which have been force multipliers and have proven to be critical in asymmetric warfare because of several unique capabilities they can bring into combat, including operating in small teams over extended period in difficult terrain.\n\n\u201cWe are also giving our officers and soldiers specialist skills to address the problems of terrorism and insurgency. I have been informed that the curriculum of the College, which you have gone through in the last 11 months, is in line with these realities.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the military merely serve to create the necessary conditions for other agencies of government to function in the restoration of long-term peace and security to the crises areas. You must understand and appreciate the important roles of other security agencies in the overall security architecture,\u201d the CDS said.\n\nBandits strike in Katsina\n\nIn a related development, bandits Wednesday killed two immigration officers and left a soldier injured after raiding a village in Jibia local government Area of Katsina state.\n\nThe incident involving the soldier occurred in Kadobe community, which lies about 25 kilometres from the local government\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe source identified the deceased immigration officers as Sani Abubakar, who hailed from Dutse, Jigawa state, and Yusuf Adam, an indigene of Kano state.\n\nThe two fallen officers are superintendent of the Immigration service.\n\nThe outlaws attacked the community at about 11: 30 p.m, killing the Immigration officers at their duty post.\n\nThe village head of Kadobe, Surajo Wakili, told PREMIUM TIMES that the bandits rustled many livestock from the community but some of the animals found their way back home in the morning.\n\nHe said residents of the area are living in fear due to frequent bandit attacks. He appealed for the deployment of more security agents to the area.\n\nComptroller of Immigration in Katsina state, Abdulrazak Mu\u2019azu, confirmed the attack but declined further comments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now mourning the deaths and receiving condolence messages. For now, it is not a time for media briefing, we will do so at the right time,\u201d Mu\u2019azu said.\n\nMeanwhile, colleagues of the slain officers have alleged poor condition of operations of the service in border communities. The officers, who asked not to be named for fear of sanction, complained of poor accommodation and lack of operational vehicles, which they said made them vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\u201cAt the Immigration check point at \u2018Babban Mutum\u2019 Control Post, in Baure LGA, there is no single operational vehicle, with many illegal migrants taking advantage of the restricted movement of immigration officers to sneak into Nigeria,\u201d an officer who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation, said.\n\nThe official alleged the police, other security agents and Immigration officers were operating illegal checkpoints to extort migrants who are taking to bush paths to avoid extortion by the officers.\n\nThere are 13 such illegal checkpoints between Babura local government area in Jigawa and Babban Mutum control post in Baure local government area of Katsina state.\n\nThe border area linking Nigeria to Damagaram in Niger Republic also has many illegal routes.\n\n14 abducted in Kaduna\n\nAlso, not less than 14 people were kidnapped following an attack by bandits at Ungwan Matari within the Sabon Tasha, Chikun local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nAmong the victims were a landlord and some of his tenants.\n\nThe bandits were said to have invaded the community which is adjoining Gbagyi villa towards Romi River at about 11.00pm Wednesday.\n\nOn arrival, the hoodlums shot sporadically, breaking fences and windows in a bid to gain access into the houses of their victims. This attack is coming barely three days after over 121 students of Bethel Baptist School also in the local government area were abducted by bandits.\n\nAlthough police authorities were yet to confirm the latest incident as at the time of the report, the immediate past council chairman of the local government, Samaila Leeman said a total of 14 members of the community were abducted by the kidnappers and taken away to an unknown destination.",

          "text": "Except a compromise is reached, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, are heading for a showdown over the impending return by Germany and the United Kingdom of artefacts stolen from the Benin Palace in 1897 during a raid by the colonial invaders.\n\nWhile the monarch favours the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, or in the alternative, a museum to be built and managed by the federal and state governments, the palace believes the governor prefers a private trust to take custody of, and manage the ancient precious artworks.\n\nHowever, Obaseki told THISDAY that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\n\u201cI intend to work with the Oba of Benin in an arrangement that would be led by the federal government,\u201d he told THISDAY, accusing a palace chief, Elemai Oseni, of misinforming the revered monarch about his plans.\n\nHe said he would straighten out things with the monarch on his return from Germany, where he and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, are currently negotiating and insisting on unconditional repatriation of the artefacts.\n\nNotwithstanding, the brewing quarrel in Benin may become public knowledge today as Oba Ewuare II addresses a historic press conference, the first ever, signposting the importance he attaches to the issue.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the brewing crisis may replay the bitter aspect of the history of ancient Benin Kingdom dating back to 1897 when Britain invaded the kingdom, subdued Oba Ovonramwen, plundered and looted his palace and sent him on exile.\n\nA Benin chief named Obaseki, said to be the great-grandfather of the current governor, was apprehended by palace historians as one of those who betrayed Oba Ovonramwen and made the British expedition a success.\n\n\u201cThe current standoff, therefore, has a touch of history,\u201d a Benin chief told THISDAY last night, pointing out: \u201cIt is significant that another Obaseki is at play on this occasion.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered that following the imminence of the return of the looted artefacts by the UK, German and French governments, Obaseki came up with a grand plan to form a private trust, not owned by the state government, to take custody of the returning artefacts.\n\nHis plan, it is gathered, is to have the private trust build a museum of West African Arts in Benin, the state capital, where the artefacts would be kept and curated.\n\nLegacy Restoration Trust, a private entity, THISDAY learnt, has since emerged, parading itself as the authorised custodian of the artefacts.\n\nOba Ewuare II is said to have opposed this move on the ground that it would amount to private appropriation of the cultural heritage of his kingdom.\n\nWhile the monarch is said not to be opposed to the idea of the federal and state governments taking custody of the artefacts and keeping it in a museum to be built by them, he has expressed his objection to a private trust managing the ancient artworks.\n\n\u201cOba Ewuare\u2019s position,\u201d said a source, \u201cis that at the least the artefacts should return to the palace where they were stolen, contending that the palace could on its own build a museum where they would be kept and manage.\u201d\n\nThis position was well articulated in a statement by Benin Traditional Council dated 10th May 2021 and signed by the Secretary, Mr. Frank Irabor; and the Executive Assistant, Corporate and Legal Affairs, Mr. Denis Osaretin.\n\nDisowning Legacy Restoration Trust and Legacy and Legal Restoration Trust that it said had been parading themselves as presumptive custodians of the incoming artefacts, it said: \u201cFor categorical clarification, these individuals and groups of persons are not known nor authorised by the Oba of Benin, who is the original owner of the looted artefacts and the custodian of Benin customs and tradition.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpololokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, Oba of Benin remains the custodia Legis of all insignia, symbols and such other artefacts depicting the rich cultural heritage of the Benin people.\u201d\n\nIt said, the Oba of Benin or his duly authorised representative or body corporate, is, therefore, the only person that can have any dealings with any foreign donours or missions or any international institution over the artefacts.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that following this statement, the Secretary to the State Government had conversations with the palace secretary but the meeting ended in a deadlock with both parties hugging their mutually exclusive positions.\n\nAt the centre of the conflict, THISDAY has learnt, is the potentially huge financial resources that might accrue from the warehousing of the artefacts.\n\nAlready, the German government is committed to an initial donation of 4.5 million Euros to the Edo Museum of West African Arts and Cultural District projected to be built in Benin City.\n\nThis was revealed in a statement on Wednesday by Foreign Minister Maas, which spoke eloquently about the desire of Germany to return the artefacts in its custody and pay adequate reparation.\n\nObaseki too had spoken glowingly about his trust project last month after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, during which he sought the federal government\u2019s help to secure the return of the artworks.\n\nObaseki said museums had become catalysts in the evolution and development of cities.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThere is a city called Bilbao in Spain, and that was the head of the Basque separatist movements many years ago.\n\n\u201cThe investment by the Guggenheim Foundation, by the Guggenheim family museum in Bilbao, has changed the economic fortunes of that city.\n\n\u201cToday, Bilbao earns more than a billion dollars from just the presence of that museum in that city. Because everybody wants to come in to see what\u2019s in that museum.\n\n\u201cSo, bringing back these works, this world cherished works, bringing the originals back to their home, I mean, you can imagine for years to come, people, children unborn, all over the world want to come and see these pieces.\u201d\n\nHe said his administration was designing a whole cultural district for Benin, saying that the proposed museum would be situated within the cultural district.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs I speak, the planners from Latin America are in Benin City, looking at work and doing the surveys. That process should end in about August.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the museum is going to be a series of, you know, buildings, you have the pavilion where these works will be brought in initially and will be kept.\n\n\u201cWe also undertaking more archaeological excavations, and whatever we find will be kept in the pavilion.\n\n\u201cWe have a national museum that currently exists. And that\u2019s going to be refurbished, then we have the main Edo Museum of West African Arts. And the construction for that will take another one or two years to begin.\u201d\n\nOba Ewuare is, however, resisting the private trust, being promoted and led by Phillip Ihenacho, said to be Obaseki\u2019s business partner in Afrinvest, with Victor Ehikhamenor, Enotie Ogbebor, Eric Idiahi and Babatunde Adebiyi as trustees with renowned Ghanaian architect, David Adjaye as architectural consultant.\n\nTHISDAY learnt the monarch had reached out to the presidency and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, who appear to be sympathetic to the cause of having the looted artefacts returned to the palace from where they were stolen.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",

          "text": "Pfizer is about to seek U.S. authorisation for a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, saying Thursday that another shot within 12 months could dramatically boost immunity and maybe help ward off the latest worrisome coronavirus mutant.\n\nResearch from multiple countries shows the Pfizer shot and other widely used COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against the highly contagious delta variant, which is spreading rapidly around the world and now accounts for most new U.S. infections.Two doses of most vaccines are critical to develop high levels of virus-fighting antibodies against all versions of the coronavirus, not just the delta variant \u2014 and most of the world still is desperate to get those initial protective doses as the pandemic continues to rage.\n\nBut antibodies naturally wane over time, so studies also are underway to tell if and when boosters might be needed.\n\nOn Thursday, Pfizer\u2019s Dr. Mikael Dolsten told The Associated Press that early data from the company\u2019s booster study suggests people\u2019s antibody levels jump five- to 10-fold after a third dose, compared to their second dose months earlier.\n\nIn August, Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of a third dose, he said.\n\nWhy might that matter for fighting the delta variant? Dolsten pointed to data from Britain and Israel showing the Pfizer vaccine \u201cneutralizes the delta variant very well.\u201d The assumption, he said, is that when antibodies drop low enough, the delta virus eventually could cause a mild infection before the immune system kicks back in.\n\nBut FDA authorization would be just a first step \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t automatically mean Americans get offered boosters, cautioned Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Public health authorities would have to decide if they\u2019re really needed, especially since millions of people have no protection.\n\n\u201cThe vaccines were designed to keep us out of the hospital\u201d and continue to do so despite the more contagious delta variant, he said. Giving another dose would be \u201ca huge effort while we are at the moment striving to get people the first dose.\u201d\n\nHours after Pfizer\u2019s announcement, U.S. health officials issued a statement saying fully vaccinated Americans don\u2019t need a booster yet.\n\nU.S. health agencies \u201care engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster might be necessary,\u201d the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a joint statement. That work will include data from the drug companies, \u201cbut does not rely on those data exclusively,\u201d and any decision on booster shots would happen only when \u201cthe science demonstrates that they are needed,\u201d the agencies said.\n\nCurrently only about 48% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated \u2014 and some parts of the country have far lower immunization rates, places where the delta variant is surging. On Thursday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, said that\u2019s leading to \u201ctwo truths\u201d \u2014 highly immunized swaths of America are getting back to normal while hospitalizations are rising in other places.\n\n\u201cThis rapid rise is troubling,\u201d she said: A few weeks ago the delta variant accounted for just over a quarter of new U.S. cases, but it now accounts for just over 50% \u2014 and in some places, such as parts of the Midwest, as much as 80%.\n\nAlso Thursday, researchers from France\u2019s Pasteur Institute reported new evidence that full vaccination is critical.\n\nIn laboratory tests, blood from several dozen people given their first dose of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines \u201cbarely inhibited\u201d the delta variant, the team reported in the journal Nature. But weeks after getting their second dose, nearly all had what researchers deemed an immune boost strong enough to neutralize the delta variant \u2014 even if it was a little less potent than against earlier versions of the virus.\n\nThe French researchers also tested unvaccinated people who had survived a bout of the coronavirus, and found their antibodies were four-fold less potent against the new mutant. But a single vaccine dose dramatically boosted their antibody levels \u2014 sparking cross-protection against the delta variant and two other mutants, the study found. That supports public health recommendations that COVID-19 survivors get vaccinated rather than relying on natural immunity.\n\nThe lab experiments add to real-world data that the delta variant\u2019s mutations aren\u2019t evading the vaccines most widely used in Western countries, but underscore that it\u2019s crucial to get more of the world immunized before the virus evolves even more.\n\nResearchers in Britain found two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, for example, are 96% protective against hospitalization with the delta variant and 88% effective against symptomatic infection. That finding was echoed last weekend by Canadian researchers, while a report from Israel suggested protection against mild delta infection may have dipped lower, to 64%.\n\nWhether the fully vaccinated still need to wear masks in places where the delta variant is surging is a growing question. In the U.S., the CDC maintains that fully vaccinated people don\u2019t need to. Even before the delta variant came along, the vaccines weren\u2019t perfect, but the best evidence suggests that if vaccinated people nonetheless get the coronavirus, they\u2019ll have much milder cases.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasize, if you were vaccinated, you have a very high degree of protection,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said Thursday.\n\nIn the U.S., case rates have been rising for weeks and the rate of hospitalizations has started to tick up, rising 7% from the previous seven-day average, Walensky told reporters Thursday. However, deaths remain down on average, which some experts believe is at least partly due to high vaccination rates in people 65 and older \u2014 who are among the most susceptible to severe disease.",
          "summary": "Pfizer is about to seek U.S. authorisation for a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, saying Thursday that another shot within 12 months could dramatically boost immunity and maybe help ward off the latest worrisome coronavirus mutant.\nIn August, Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of a third dose, he said.\nWhy might that matter for fighting the delta variant?\nBut a single vaccine dose dramatically boosted their antibody levels \u2014 sparking cross-protection against the delta variant and two other mutants, the study found.\nResearchers in Britain found two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, for example, are 96% protective against hospitalization with the delta variant and 88% effective against symptomatic infection.",

          "title": "Foreign Hit Squad Killed Haiti\u2019s President Moise, Police Say",
          "text": "A hit squad composed mostly of retired Colombian soldiers assassinated Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse earlier this week, police say.\n\nThe group included 26 Colombians and two Americans of Haitian origin, police chief L\u00e9on Charles told reporters.\n\nEight of the suspects are still on the run, while 17, including the two Americans, have been arrested.\n\nThe remaining suspects were shot dead during gun battles with the police in the capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, a group of gunmen broke into the president\u2019s home and shot him and his wife. Mr Mo\u00efse was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and died at the scene, according to authorities.\n\nHis wife Martine was seriously injured and has been flown to Florida for treatment, where she is said to be in a stable condition.\n\nIt is not yet clear who planned the attack or what motivated it. Haiti\u2019s interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, however, told the BBC that the 53-year-old president may have been targeted because he was fighting \u201coligarchs\u201d in the country.\n\nOn Thursday, police presented some of the suspects to the media along with weapons, Colombian passports and other evidence. \u201cForeigners came to our country to kill the president,\u201d Mr Charles said.\n\n\u201cWe will strengthen our investigation and search techniques to intercept the other eight mercenaries,\u201d he added.\n\nColombia\u2019s government has said at least six members of the alleged hit squad appeared to be retired members of its military. It has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts.\n\nThe US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained.\n\nInvestigators are still searching for the masterminds of the killing, which has triggered some civil unrest in what is the poorest nation in the Americas.\n\nAn angry crowd gathered on Thursday to watch the police operation in the capital. Some cars were torched, and people gathered outside a police station where the suspects were being held.\n\nA state of emergency remains in force across the country.\n\nThe assassination has prompted confusion over who is in charge of Haiti. The constitution says the president of the Supreme Court should take over, but he recently died of Covid-19.\n\nAfter that, amendments suggest the prime minister should lead. During his four years in office, Mr Mo\u00efse had six prime ministers and on Monday, a day before he was killed, he had nominated a seventh, Ariel Henry.\n\nMr Henry had not yet been sworn in, but insists he should be in charge.\n\nMr Joseph, the interim prime minister, told the BBC he was \u201cpuzzled\u201d by Mr Henry\u2019s statement.\n\nThe UN has said Mr Joseph should remain in charge until elections are held later this year.\n\nHe has said he will not stand for the presidency. \u201cI\u2019m not here to stay too long. We need to hold elections. I do not have a personal agenda,\u201d he said.\n\nHeavily armed assassins stormed the president\u2019s home in the hills above Port-au-Prince at around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nVideo released after the shooting appeared to show heavily armed men dressed in black pretending to be US drugs agents, shouting: \u201cDEA [US Drug Enforcement Administration] operations, everybody stay down!\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s office and bedroom were ransacked during the attack.\n\nThe first couple\u2019s three children, Jomarlie, Jovenel Jr and Joverlein, are reportedly in a \u201csafe location\u201d, officials said.\n\nEven before President Mo\u00efse\u2019s assassination, the situation in Haiti was marked by instability and there had been widespread protests demanding his resignation.\n\nParliamentary elections should have been held in October 2019 but disputes delayed them, meaning Mr Mo\u00efse had been ruling by decree.",
