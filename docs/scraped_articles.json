          "text": "By Ibrahim Wuyo, Kaduna\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor has confirmed that a military jet crashed in the Northwest region but the pilot survived the crash.\n\nIrabor spoke in Kaduna on Monday at an interactive session with senior and junior officers from the North West.\n\nIrabor who did not give details, said the pilot was flown to an undisclosed hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force, Edward Gabkwet, an Air Commodore ,explained in a statement on Monday that on 18 July 2021, at about 12.45 pm, a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet aircraft, returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna State, came under intense enemy fire which led to its crash in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cLuckily, the gallant pilot of the aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, successfully ejected from the aircraft. Using his survival instincts, the pilot, who came under intense ground fire from the bandits, was able to evade them and sought refuge in nearby settlements awaiting sunset.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing the cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation, Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several bandits\u2019 strongholds and maneuvered his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that upon receipt of the news of the crash, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, had directed that all efforts must be emplaced to rescue the pilot. Accordingly, NAF Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and helicopter gunships provided close air support to NAF Special Forces and Nigerian Army troops who were able to locate the crash site and the pilot\u2019s parachute, while also combing nearby locations for any sign of the pilot. It is gladdening to note that while in hiding, Flight Lieutenant Dairo confirmed that the presence of NAF aircraft within the vicinity of the crash site helped in scaring the bandits who were after him, thus enabling him to find refuge and escape to a safe location.\n\n\u201cIt is important to also recall that only recently, the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, had directed the Armed Forces of Nigeria to do all it takes to flush out criminal elements in Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna States. It is in fulfilment of this directive that the NAF, in conjunction with surface forces, has in the last 2 weeks mounted intensive day and night air interdiction operations against bandits and their hideouts, especially in these 3 states. Through these intensive air operations, hundreds of bandits have been neutralized and several of their hideouts destroyed.\n\n\u201cDespite the setback of yesterday\u2019s crash, the NAF remains committed towards fulfilling Mr President\u2019s mandate as well as other constitutional roles assigned to it. The willingness, readiness and tested ability of the NAF remains unshaken and unwavering as it continues to carry out its assigned roles,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Ex-2nd Vice Chairman of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Monday Ubani, has criticized members of the National Assembly for the rejection of the electronic transmission of election results in the recent electoral reform bill.\n\nHe said that the federal lawmakers exhibited legislative rascality in their actions and insisted that the Nigeria electoral process needed the involvement of technologies to achieve acceptable and transparent elections.\n\nUbani, who is currently the Chairman, NBA Section on Public Interest and Development Law (SPIDEL), in a statement issued to DAILY POST on Monday, maintained that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) must be given a fair and less restrictive legal framework to carry out their constitutional duties of organising, undertaking and supervising elections in Nigeria.\n\nHe further stated that the National Assembly members, by passing the bill, clearly violated the constitution of the land which they swore to uphold, describing the unfolded scenario as the biggest embarrassment of the century.\n\nThe Abia-born lawyer added that Nigeria has two years to ensure 100 percent network coverage in the whole country, saying, \u201cthere is no reason the country cannot vote more billions of naira for development of our key tele-comunication infrastructure that will restore the nation\u2019s dignity as the biggest country in African continent\u201d.\n\nNASS Salary: Ex-NBA vice-chairman, Ubani writes AGF, demands enforcement of judgment\n\nAccording to Ubani, \u201cthe present manipulative treachery to keep us stranded as a nation in our electoral improvements will be resisted with our last strength and we have the final hope placed on the third arm of the government( the judiciary) should these set of legislators persist in their doomed journey of interfering on our progressive electoral journey as a nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that Nigeria with her size, resources and sophistication are even starting late on this, because other nations smaller in size, resource, sophistication have deployed this system years ago and here we are in the year 2021 debating whether we should deploy technology in the transmission of our electoral results.\n\n\u201cI feel humiliated by such a scenario playing out in the hallowed chambers of our national assembly. Who does that, if I may ask. The macabre dance over this started in the National Assembly with confirmed allegation that the Bill which passed third reading under the chairmanship of Senator Kabiru Gaya of INEC Committee has been altered to block electronic transfer of election results.\n\nContinuing, he added, \u201cthe situation in the House of Representatives was not different but more dramatic as the man who presided over the plenary did not hide his disdain to observance of the very rules that guide proceedings in the House. The Deputy Speaker, Hon Ahmed Wase to say the least is a big minus to democracy who does not believe in adherence to rules and procedures of the House. It is more shocking and depressing to see those who claim to be lawyers running around all over the place to defend the absurd illegality. Who did this to us as a nation? How did we get here, many are asking.\n\n\u201cPrior to now, INEC without any legislative backing have successfully conducted elections with card readers and have transmitted results electronically in several constituencies in Nigeria without any of these \u201calarmist drawbacks\u201d being trumpeted by these backward-thinking legislators that voted for that provocative amendment. Why are these sets of legislators in the 9th Assembly trying to set the hand of our clock backwards?

So we are not discussing the mosque,\u201d MURIC said.\n\nThe group said that Makinde shot himself in the foot by trying to manoeuver his way out of the question, adding that he inadvertently admitted that he is building a recreation centre.\n\n\u201cMr. Governor Sir, in what location are you building your recreation centre? Is it not on the Muslim praying ground? But that was exactly what we accused you of doing. Statements like \u2018The new construction will not in any way tamper with the existing mosque in the area\u2019 is not only diversionary. It is deceitful. Nigerians are not fools,\u201d MURIC added.\n\n\u201cMakinde is simply afraid of his own shadow because MURIC has never been known to foment trouble.\u201d\n\nMURIC noted that the only language that politicians such as Makinde understand \u2018is the next election\u2019, \u201cOyo State Muslims spoke to the late Bola Ige in the language he understood.

There is no going back on this. because we are prepared to assist in securing their release from the abductors.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that, if these abducted students were children of Ministers, Senators, I am sure they would have been freed by now.\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t imagine what the female ones are passing through in captivity. One cannot also rule out daily sexual molestations of the females among the abductees.\n\n\u201cHe has to intervene on humanitarian grounds. This is an issue that the international community should look into.\n\n\u201cAs earlier said, we won\u2019t leave any stone unturned to ensure they regain their freedom. We can equally inform Nigerians authoritatively that we shall have a crucial meeting with the parents of the abducted students in Kaduna this weekend.\n\n\u201cAll hands must be on deck to secure the freedom of these abducted students. We won\u2019t give up on them. We shall also expect the parents of the abducted students to pray and fast along with us on the 26th day of this month.\n\n\u201cWe are very optimistic that the students will soon regain their freedom.

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently instruct Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture, and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to withdraw the directive banning journalists and broadcast stations from reporting details of terrorist attacks and victims across the country.\n\nNBC had in a letter dated July 7 issued a directive asking journalists, television and radio stations in Nigeria to stop glamourising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nSERAP, in a letter to President Buhari, expressed grave concern that contents of the NBC directive would restrict the rights to freedom of expression, information, and victims\u2019 right to justice and effective remedies that are central to public debate and accountability in a democratic society.\n\nIn a letter dated 17 July and signed by its deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP said: \u201cThe contents of the directive by the NBC to journalists and broadcast stations are entirely inconsistent and incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s obligations under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We would be grateful if the repressive directive is withdrawn within 24 hours of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, the SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions in the public interest.\n\n\u201cReporting on the growing violence and killings in many parts of the country is a matter of public interest. The NBC directive to journalists and broadcast stations to stop reporting these cases, coupled with the possibility of fines and other punishment, would have a disproportionate chilling effect on the work of those seeking to hold the government accountable to the public.\n\n\u201cThe broad definitions of what may constitute \u2018too many details\u2019, \u2018glamourising\u2019, \u2018divisive rhetoric\u2019, and \u2018security issues\u2019 heighten concerns of overreach, confer far-reaching discretion on the government, and suggest that the NBC directive is more intrusive than necessary. These words and phrases do not indicate precisely what kind of individual conduct would fall within their ambit.\n\n\u201cThe vague and overbroad definitions of \u2018too many details\u2019, \u2018glamourising\u2019, \u2018divisive rhetoric\u2019, and \u2018security issues\u2019 also raise concern that the NBC directive unduly interferes with the rights to freedom of expression and information, and is disproportionate to any purported legitimate governmental aim. Ill-defined and/or overly broad directives are open to arbitrary application and abuse. The use of these words and phrases by the NBC, given their opaque and ambiguous meaning, leaves open the possibility for application beyond unequivocal incitement to hatred, hostility or violence. Such words and phrases may function to interpret legitimate reporting by broadcast stations, journalists, and other Nigerians as unlawful.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Kukah a disappointment for castigating Nigeria before foreigners \u2013Presidency",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Presidency has described Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Most Revd Matthew Kukah, as a disappointment for saying President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government has failed to tackle insecurity as it promised before taking over power in 2015.\n\nKukah had stated this during a virtual presentation to the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in Washington, DC, on the persecution of Christians in Nigeria by armed extremist groups in the North, last Wednesday.\n\nA statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said it was troubling for Kukah to copy the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\n\nThe Presidency also accused the cleric of sowing discord and strife among Nigerians.\n\nIt said it is quite disturbing that Kukah suggested that investment in infrastructure between Nigeria and Niger is wasteful and biased, when a similar infrastructure project between Lagos and Benin Republic has revolutionised relationship between the two neighbouring economies to the advantage.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate, and disappointing, for citizens of Nigeria to bear witness to one of their Churchmen castigating their country in front of representatives of a foreign parliament. We are all too familiar with these overseas political tours that opposition politicians take \u2013 visiting foreign leaders and legislators in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. So, the argument goes, if they are heard seriously abroad, then Nigerian citizens back home should surely listen to them too.\n\n\u201cBut in order to be heard at all, and to maximise media coverage back home for their activities, inevitably these visits involve painting the worst possible picture of our country before their chosen foreign audience.\n\n\u201cSoon enough we inescapably hear an identical list of racist tropes against northerners, how one religion dominates governance above all others, how the government is doing nothing to address herder-farmer disturbances, and how the government spends money on infrastructure to benefit everyone but the group and religion of the speaker. Of course, in order not to disappoint their western audience, regardless of fact, the list is always the same and always slanted for whoever wishes to cross-check.\n\n\u201cNigerians expect this from their unimaginative opposition \u2013 but it is troubling when a so-called man of the Church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\n\n\u201cOnly this government has put forward the first and singular plan in nearly a century to address herder-farmer challenges \u2013 a fact recognised by international NGOs, including the International Crisis Group. To declare to a foreign audience that this government does nothing is an incredible falsehood.\n\n\u201cThere is no bias in this government when the president is northern and Muslim, the vice president southern and Christian, and the cabinet equally balanced between the two religions. But neither is there anything in our Constitution to state that political posts must be apportioned according to ethnicity or faith. It takes a warped frame of mind for a critic to believe ethnicity is of primary importance in public appointments. It is yet more troubling to hear a Churchman isolating one group for criticism purely on ethnic lines.\n\n\u201cWith due respect to the esteemed position he holds, the Bishop\u2019s assertion that only Christian schools are being targeted by bandits or terrorists is not supported by the facts on the ground. It is sad to say, but also true that victims of crime, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism cut across all strata of the society. Sad but true that Kankara students in Katsina State were stolen by bandits of the same Islamic faith as those they took away.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "OPEC+ Resolves Impasse, to Boost Production by 400,000bpd",
          "text": "*PIB will take care of host oil communities, secure environment, says Buhari\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nAfter over a two-week stalemate, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, yesterday resolved to gradually add more inventory to the oil market, as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) finally put aside their differences.\n\nWith the new agreement, the oil cartel will boost supply by as much as 400,000 barrels per day each month from August until all of its stranded output due to its decision to curb production last year, following the twin impact of the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia and COVID-19 pandemic, has been restored.\n\nThe breakthrough came just as President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will take care of agitations by host oil communities and ensure that the environment is protected from harm.\n\nAccording to the new deal, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Russia have now been given new baselines against which their production cuts are measured from May next year.\n\nThe baselines, which were set using October 2018 production volumes, are used by the OPEC+ alliance to set output quotas, so a higher baseline for a country would result in a more generous allocation.\n\nThe UAE had said that the way its quota was calculated was unfair because it didn\u2019t reflect a costly expansion in the country\u2019s industry. Now seemingly convinced by the country\u2019s presentation, the baseline was increased yesterday to 3.5 million barrels per day, below the 3.8 million it initially demanded but well above the previous level of 3.2 million.\n\nOne of the immediate impacts of the new agreement is that it will ease a looming supply shortage and reduce the risk of an inflationary oil-price spike as well as end the division with the OPEC group.\n\nBack home in Nigeria, it is also expected that the truce will lead to some relief for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), whose Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, recently raised the alarm over the rising oil price.\n\nKyari hard warned that a rising oil price was bad for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria since buyers of the nation\u2019s crude would either resort to buying less or start the search for alternatives.\n\nKyari put the oil price band with which Nigeria would be comfortable at between $50 to $60 per barrel. The price of the commodity hit $77 recently before falling to between $73 and rising again to $75 during the last week.\n\nWith certainty now restored to the market, consumers now have a clear line of sight as to how quickly OPEC+ will restore the 5.8 million barrels a day of production it is still withholding.\n\nA statement after the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), held via videoconference, stated that the ongoing strengthening of market fundamentals, with oil demand showing clear signs of improvement as economic recovery has continued in most parts of the world with the help of accelerating vaccination programmes.\n\nOPEC welcomed the positive performance of participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), especially their overall conformity to the production adjustments which was out 113 per cent in June.\n\nThe statement said OPEC resolved to \u201cAdjust upward their overall production by 0.4 mb/d on a monthly basis starting August 2021 until phasing out the 5.8 mb/d production adjustment, and in December 2021 assess market developments and participating countries\u2019 performance.\n\n\u201cContinue to adhere to the mechanism to hold monthly OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meetings for the entire duration of the Declaration of Cooperation, to assess market conditions and decide on production level adjustments for the following month, endeavouring to end production adjustments by the end of September 2022, subject to market conditions.\u201d\n\nEffective May 1, 2022, OPEC further agreed to adjust the baseline for the calculations of the production adjustments and reiterated the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and taking advantage of the extension of the compensation period until the end of September 2021 and fixed the next meeting for September 1, 2021.\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s reference oil production up to the end of April 2022 and effective May 2022 stayed at 1.829 million barrels per day, countries that had theirs raised included Iraq, which was increased from 4.653 million bpd to 4.803 million bpd, while Kuwait\u2019s was raised from 2.809 million bpd to 2.0959 million bpd.\n\nAlso, Saudi Arabia\u2019s baseline was raised from 11 million bpd to 11. 5 million bpd, UAE had theirs raised from 3.168 million bpd to 3.5 million bpd and Russia\u2019s was put at 11.5 million bpd from 11 million bpd.\n\nBut it is unclear how quickly additional supplies can be delivered to the market as August sales volumes are largely locked in and most Gulf countries are preparing for an Islamic holiday that will close government offices and businesses for most or all of next week.\n\nBuhari: PIB Will Take Care of Host Oil Communities, Secure Environment\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will take care of agitations by host oil communities and ensure that the environment is protected from harm.\n\nIn an exclusive interview in the just-released OPEC bulletin, which was dedicated to Nigeria, the president stated that when it becomes law, the legislation will reinvigorate the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Nigerian oil and gas industry needs reinvigoration in the presence of the global uncertainty and the threats surrounding the industry. This is the purpose of the PIB. We need more investment to be able to derive optimal benefits from these natural resources.\n\n\u201cWe need a better enabling environment for growth in the industry. We need to take better care of the host communities. We need to be more environmentally conscious. And so the PIB is focused on all these, and more.\u201d\n\nHe lauded the oil cartel for the role it has consistently played in the industry, saying that is important because without OPEC the oil industry would have been in a chaotic situation where the winner takes all.\n\nHe added: \u201cMany countries, like Nigeria, would not have been able to develop their oil industry due to stiff competition. However, the good collaboration between OPEC member countries has made it possible to accommodate both the weak and strong players in the oil production industry. This has been very important, and a catalyst, to the development of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the country must constantly look ahead and plan for the future to ensure that it does not get caught off guard, reason it has to keep investing and strengthening its local capability, both in technology and human resources.\n\nHe stated that being a member of OPEC has facilitated closer relationships and fostered bilateral cooperation in other fields and industries as members seek areas where they can be of help to one another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Accuses Catholic bishop of portraying Nigeria in bad light before foreign audience\n\n*Faults Catholic bishop\u2019s position on state of the nation\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Presidency on Sunday formally responded to the recent position of the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Father Matthew Kukah, before the United States Congress that nothing really works in Nigeria saying the cleric\u2019s position is an incredible falsehood.\n\nIt also described as unfortunate and disappointing the position of the \u201cso-called\u201d man of God painting his country in bad light before a foreign parliament.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a release, stated that it was unfortunate, and disappointing, for citizens of Nigeria to bear witness to one of their Churchmen castigating their country in front of representatives of a foreign parliament.\n\nThe Presidency said it was familiar with overseas political tours that opposition politicians take \u2013 visiting foreign leaders and legislators in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe saying the argument goes that if they are heard seriously abroad, then Nigerian citizens back home should surely listen to them too.\n\nIt said: \u201cBut in order to be heard at all, and to maximise media coverage back home for their activities, inevitably these visits involve painting the worst possible picture of our country before their chosen foreign audience.\n\n\u201cSoon enough we inescapably hear an identical list of racist tropes against Northerners, how one religion dominates governance above all others, how the government is doing nothing to address herder-farmer disturbances, and how the government spends money on infrastructure to benefit everyone but the group and religion of the speaker. Of course, in order not to disappoint their western audience, regardless of fact, the list is always the same-and always slanted for whoever wishes to cross-check.\u201d\n\nThe release added that Nigerians expect such position from their unimaginative opposition stressing that it is troubling when a \u201cso-called\u201d man of the Church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\n\nThe Presidency also explained steps taken so far by the present administration to tackle the issue of herder-farmer disturbances saying \u201conly this government has put forward the first and singular plan in nearly a century to address herder-farmer challenges \u2013 a fact recognised by international NGOs, including the International Crisis Group\u201d.\n\nIt further punctured Kukah\u2019s position that the Buhari-led government had done nothing in six years.\n\n\u201cTo declare to a foreign audience that this government does nothing is an incredible falsehood\u201d.\n\nRather than the investment in infrastructure between Nigeria and Niger being wasteful and biased as erroneously said by Kukah, the Presidency stressed that a similar infrastructure project between Lagos and Benin has revolutionised the two neighbouring economies to the advantage of both countries.\n\nIt emphasised that there is religious balancing in government appointments notwithstanding that the 1999 Constitution never stipulated ethnic or religious leaning in appointments into public office\n\n\u201cThere is no bias in this government when the president is northern and Muslim, the vice president southern and Christian, and the cabinet equally balanced between the two religions. But neither is there anything in our Constitution to state that political posts must be apportioned according to ethnicity or faith. It takes a warped frame of mind for a critic to believe ethnicity is of primary importance in public appointments. It is yet more troubling to hear a Churchman isolating one group for criticism purely on ethnic lines\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency further punctured Kukah\u2019s position that only Christian schools were being attacked by bandits and terrorists saying it is untrue as both Christian and Muslim schools had suffered in the past in the hands of the terrorists and bandits.\n\nIt said: \u201cWith due respect to the esteemed position he holds, the Bishop\u2019s assertion that only Christian schools are being targeted by bandits or terrorists is not supported by the facts on the ground. It is sad to say but also true that victims of crime, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism cut across all strata of the society. Sad but true that Kankara students in Katsina State were stolen by bandits of the same Islamic faith as those they took away. The same may be true of those who are still holding the 134 students of the Islamic School at Tegina in Niger State. The nation witnessed the sad incident of the female students abducted by bandits at Jangebe in Zamfara State and the over 100 predominantly Muslim students of the Federal Government Girls College Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State who are currently in captivity- and the nation\u2019s security agencies are hard at work to release them unharmed.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Christian students is sad and unacceptable; so also is the abduction of students of other faiths. The claim that only Christian schools are being targeted is totally untrue.\n\n\u201cAs a nation and a people, we must together define evil as evil. We must not allow our religious differences to divide us. No one gains but the evil doers when we divide our ranks according to ethnicity and religion in confronting them. The bandit, kidnapper and terrorist are the enemies of the people who should be confronted in unison.\u201d\n\nThe statement also quoted copiously from the Bible to support its claim on ethnicity and racialism\n\n\u201cTo be clear, The Bible is definitive on matters of ethnicity and racialism: In Romans 2:9-10, it says: \u201cThere will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honour and peace for everyone who does good\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd in Galatians 3:28: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d Whether Christian or Muslim, we stand by these beliefs and are steadfastly committed to them in governance\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency used the forum to be hard on the cleric for disparaging Nigeria before a foreign audience saying \u201cthere is no place in mainstream civil discourse for those who actively, negatively, and publicly label an individual ethnic group, especially before a foreign audience.\n\n\u201cThese are not the views expressed or opinions held by the vast majority of the citizens of Nigeria. For all our challenges as a nation, nearly all of us seek to live together in harmony, celebrating differences, and finding common ground as Nigerians above all. But people like Kukah are doing their best to sow discord and strife among Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMore than any other set of people, leaders \u2013 in politics or religion who preach respect for truth have a duty to practice it. It is a moral and practical responsibility.\n\n\u201cGoing by the history of the Church as is well known, it will stand up publicly for the truth.\n\nIt is time others did the same.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022With 27% female CEOs, banks make great leap in sustainable principles\n\nBy Obinna Chima\n\nThe banking industry has made a dramatic leap in its Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles (NSBP) with the recent appointments of two females as Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). The coming on board of the CEOs, Mrs. Miriam Olusanya for Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) and Mrs. Yemisi Edun for First City Monument Bank (FCMB) Limited, marks an important paradigm shift in the approach to decision-making and management with regard to gender at the highest levels of the Nigerian banking industry.\n\nThe NSBP states that as part of a wider sustainable banking commitment, the industry should work towards 40 per cent female representation at top management and boards levels.\n\nCurrently, there are seven female CEOs of 23 banks in the country.\n\nThe other five banks headed by females are: FSDH Merchant Bank Limited (Mrs. Bukola Smith); Fidelity Bank Plc (Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe); Suntrust Bank (Mrs. Halima Buba); Citibank Nigeria (Mrs. Ireti Samuel-Ogbu) and Unity Bank Plc (Mrs. Oluwatomi Somefun).\n\nThe appointments of the seven women (except Smith) marked the first time ladies would lead the respective financial institutions.\n\nNSBP, which was introduced in 2012, requires banks to develop clear short and long term objectives on their business activities and provide products and services aimed at promoting gender equality for women and financial inclusion. It also advises banks to promote a gender-inclusive culture and female talent-management schemes, establish internal committees that comprise senior leaders from across the business to oversee accountability for gender diversity and steer gender inclusive strategies consistent with their core business activities, among others.\n\nThe goals of the NSBP are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which states that encouraging more women leaders would help achieve greater gender equality.\n\nMany believe providing more opportunities for women to progress to senior roles in an industry that remains a male bastion is a step in the right direction.\n\nBelow are the profiles of the seven female bank CEOs in the country.\n\nMiriam Olusanya, GTBank\n\nMiriam Olusanya has over 23 years banking experience that cuts across Transaction Services, Asset and Liability Management, Financial Markets, Investment Banking, and Investor Relations.

          "text": "The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) says Abayomi Dairo, a flight lieutenant, survived after one of its fighter jets crashed in Zamfara.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a report of the crash on Sunday, but Edward Gabkwet, NAF spokesperson, said the air force was still trying to get the report of the incident.\n\nConfirming the crash in a statement on Monday, Gabkwet said the fighter jet was returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna states when it came under heavy fire from bandits and crashed in Zamfara.\n\nAccording to him, Dairo, the pilot of the jet, successfully ejected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201dLuckily, the gallant pilot of the aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, successfully ejected from the aircraft. Using his survival instincts, the pilot, who came under intense ground fire from the bandits, was able to evade them and sought refuge in nearby settlements awaiting sunset,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cUsing the cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation, Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several bandits\u2019 strongholds and maneuvered his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that upon receipt of the news of the crash, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, had directed that all efforts must be emplaced to rescue the pilot. Accordingly, NAF Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and helicopter gunships provided close air support to NAF Special Forces and Nigerian Army troops who were able to locate the crash site and the pilot\u2019s parachute, while also combing nearby locations for any sign of the pilot. It is gladdening to note that while in hiding, Flight Lieutenant Dairo confirmed that the presence of NAF aircraft within the vicinity of the crash site helped in scaring the bandits who were after him, thus enabling him to find refuge and escape to a safe location.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is important to also recall that only recently, the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, had directed the Armed Forces of Nigeria to do all it takes to flush out criminal elements in Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna States. It is in fulfilment of this directive that the NAF, in conjunction with surface forces, has in the last 2 weeks mounted intensive day and night air interdiction operations against bandits and their hideouts, especially in these 3 states.\n\n\u201cThrough these intensive air operations, hundreds of bandits have been neutralized and several of their hideouts destroyed. Despite the setback of yesterday\u2019s crash, the NAF remains committed towards fulfilling Mr President\u2019s mandate as well as other constitutional roles assigned to it. The willingness, readiness and tested ability of the NAF remains unshaken and unwavering as it continues to carry out its assigned roles. Kindly bring the information to the awareness of the general public.\u201d",

Using his survival instincts, the pilot, who came under intense ground fire from the bandits, was able to evade them and sought refuge in nearby settlements awaiting sunset,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cUsing the cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation, Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several bandits\u2019 strongholds and maneuvered his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that upon receipt of the news of the crash, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, had directed that all efforts must be emplaced to rescue the pilot. Accordingly, NAF Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and helicopter gunships provided close air support to NAF Special Forces and Nigerian Army troops who were able to locate the crash site and the pilot\u2019s parachute, while also combing nearby locations for any sign of the pilot. It is gladdening to note that while in hiding, Flight Lieutenant Dairo confirmed that the presence of NAF aircraft within the vicinity of the crash site helped in scaring the bandits who were after him, thus enabling him to find refuge and escape to a safe location.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is important to also recall that only recently, the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, had directed the Armed Forces of Nigeria to do all it takes to flush out criminal elements in Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna States. It is in fulfilment of this directive that the NAF, in conjunction with surface forces, has in the last 2 weeks mounted intensive day and night air interdiction operations against bandits and their hideouts, especially in these 3 states.\n\n\u201cThrough these intensive air operations, hundreds of bandits have been neutralized and several of their hideouts destroyed. Despite the setback of yesterday\u2019s crash, the NAF remains committed towards fulfilling Mr President\u2019s mandate as well as other constitutional roles assigned to it. The willingness, readiness and tested ability of the NAF remains unshaken and unwavering as it continues to carry out its assigned roles. Kindly bring the information to the awareness of the general public.\u201d",

          "text": "Unique and untapped\n\nFrancophone Africa is home to an island country where many African startups register their headquarters. Two days ago, this country reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists, which may include people founding new companies and seeking a tax-friendly environment.\n\nYes, Mauritius.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, startups and SMEs in francophone Africa received $417.9 million, according to Briter Bridges, a research firm. 89% of that money went to businesses domiciled in Mauritius.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a high-income economy, Mauritius has only about 1 million people which is not a huge market. So where does the real action happen in the region?\n\nWe\u2019ll use Partech Africa\u2019s report on venture capital funding in 2020.\n\nMorocco ($11.2m), Senegal ($8.8m), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($6.5m), Algeria ($5.5m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($4.6m) are the top five for venture capital funding. Rounding off the region\u2019s top ten are Cameroon, Togo, Tunisia, Benin and Mauritius (startups that operate there, not just domiciled).\n\nThe $52m raised by all ten countries combined is far less than what Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Ghana raised.\n\n\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nThis is where I clarify that Partech only counts equity deals that are at least $200,000 in size; such investments must be in tech or digital startups. So there could be $15k to $50k grants or loans being written for innovative food processing companies or waste recyclers that are not captured.\n\nThat said, we can definitely say that startups in Africa\u2019s 21 french-speaking countries trail behind the top five where tech investment is concerned.\n\nIf we exclude Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, francophone Africa is a near 300 million market: the seven countries using the West Africa CFA franc (~125 million people), six Central African countries using the Central African franc (~55m people) and DR Congo which, at about 100 million, is Africa\u2019s third largest country after Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n\n[Read: A spotlight on DR Congo\u2019s early-stage tech ecosystem]\n\nSome startups have taken note of this relatively homogeneous culture and currency and leapt into the region.\n\nGozem, a ride-hailing company which also offers ecommerce services, launched in Gabon, its third francophone country, this year with eyes on Cameroon and Dr Congo. Bizao, a cross-border payment company, has stretched across 10 countries.\n\nDjamo (founders pictured at the top of today\u2019s edition) is building a finance app to cover the region and became the first francophone African startup to be accepted into Y Combinator. Two Cameroon-based fintech companies, Maviance and Diool, have raised at least $3m each this year for continental ambitions.\n\nThese ventures, it must be said, are the exception.\n\nFrancophone Africa is dogged by lack of clarity around regulations, language barriers and limited networking opportunities, per Briter Bridges report. Presidential power play in the DRC and an anglophone crisis in Cameroon are examples of the region\u2019s uncertain business climate.\n\nThese concerns will take some time to quell, so maybe unicorn bells won\u2019t ring in francophone Africa anytime soon.\n\nBut 2021 could be the region\u2019s best funding year yet; a big french bank is set to invest in a West African francophone VC fund this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. So watch out \u2013 and maybe prepare to join my plane.",

          "title": "Why food-on-demand can be Gokada\u2019s ticket to super app stardom",
          "text": "Gokada\u2019s motorcycle-hailing business in Nigeria did not hibernate because there was no demand.\n\nThe evidence is on the streets of Lagos today where motorcycle transport has returned. If GRide had a death certificate, the cause of death would be head-on collision with sudden government policy. It was a near-death experience but Gokada scrapped itself for parts and started a rebirth in March 2020.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since the company pivoted from being a ride-hailing provider to a logistics company.\n\nGRide became GSend to help businesses and individuals in Lagos with intra-city deliveries. Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo.

          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Central bank digital currencies differ from crypto. Here\u2019s how they work",
          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNigeria\u2019s Electoral Act amendment saga\n\nNigerian government\u2019s plan to monitor WhatsApp messages\n\nWhatsApp rolling out the beta version of multi-device capability\n\nAkiba Digital\u2019s $1.1M pre-seed\n\nNigeria\u2019s electronic transmission of votes saga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Voters Machines prepped for elections in KAD-SIECOM\n\nOn Friday, July 16, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives summoned and questioned the National Communication Commission (NCC) over the suitability of electronic devices for the transmission of election results.\n\nThe House was debating Section 52(2) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, which mandated the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to transmit election results when and where practicable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nValid concerns? Ubale Maska, Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, told the House that less than 50% of the country enjoys 3G Internet coverage. He also said that as of 2018, in 109,000 out of Nigeria\u2019s 119,000 polling units, only 2G and 3G networks were available.\n\nCommenting on whether the 2G network could be effectively used for the electronic transmission of results, Maska answered negatively.\n\nAfter its deliberations, the House passed the bill into law, retaining the old provision which allowed INEC to decide its path.\n\nWhy is this important? Nigeria\u2019s elections have been replete with electoral malpractice and violence. The introduction of electronic transmission of results is expected to resolve ballot box stealing and polling unit violence.\n\nA good time to revisit this: From ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?\n\nA look at NCC\u2019s Industry statistics for May 2021 reveals that broadband penetration stood at 35.59%, the lowest it has been since May 2020. Not very surprising if you remember the recent ban \u2014 which has been lifted \u2014 on the registration of new sims.\n\nWith issues like uniform Right of Way charges still being debated, increased broadband penetration seems a long way off. With that, the hope of electronic transmission of results in Nigeria might have again died a slow, painful death.\n\nThe Nigerian government plans to monitor WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@bermixstudio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Bermix Studio</a> on <a\n\nDo you remember seeing similar headlines like this last week?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Monday, July 12 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National assembly approved a \u20a64,870,350,000 ($11,831,964.98) budget for the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) to track, intercept and monitor calls and messages on mobile devices, including Thuraya and WhatsApp.\n\nBreaking it down: \u20a61,931,700,000 ($4,692,846.87) was earmarked for \u201cWhatsApp Intercept Solution\u201d, and \u20a62,938,650,000 ($7,139,118.11) for \u201cThuraya Interception Solution\u201d \u2014 a communications system used for monitoring voice calls or call-related information, SMS, data traffic, among others.\n\nEver noticed WhatsApp\u2019s \u201cMessages and calls are end-to-end encrypted\u201d note at the beginning of a chat? If you haven\u2019t, then you can go check it out. Meanwhile, here\u2019s what it means.\n\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a secure communication method that prevents third parties from accessing data while transferring from one end system or device to another.\n\nIn an ideal world, even WhatsApp itself doesn\u2019t know the juicy gossip you share with your friends on its platform. Or so it claims.\n\nCan E2EE be hacked? Is that a trick question? Of course, it can. There\u2019s no foolproof security system. However, it requires technology that is usually only available to state actors and organised criminal enterprises.\n\nCoincidentally \u2014 or not \u2014 the government made no mention of why it was authorising the monitoring of WhatsApp messages. But in the wake of several issues like the #EndSars protests, #TwitterBan and calls for social media regulation, we can only speculate?\n\nIf you have any ideas, I\u2019d love to have a chat. Just leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nBut, we are not done with WhatsApp yet. Keep scrolling.\n\nWhatsApp rolls out beta testing for multi-device capability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter almost a year\u2019s wait, WhatsApp is finally testing out its multi-device capability feature. It revealed this in a Facebook Engineering blog post on Wednesday, July 14, 2021.\n\nRemember when we talked about WhatsApp\u2019s plan to allow multiple device capability within two months in June? We didn\u2019t know how it would work. But now we do.\n\nOne of the major challenges with using WhatsApp on multiple devices was figuring out how to maintain E2EE without storing messages on the platform\u2019s server.\n\nWell, there\u2019s a lot of technical mumbo jumbo involved, but WhatsApp says that unlike its current model of using your phone as the primary device, it will use a client-fanout approach, where the WhatsApp client sending the message encrypts and transmits it N number of times to N number of different devices \u2014 those in the sender and receiver\u2019s device lists.\n\nOnce you send a message from one device, it automatically encrypts and transmits it to all your devices.\n\nYou\u2019ll still need to scan a QR code to connect a new device, but it automatically moves all your message history in one bulk delivery. Also, you\u2019ll still need real-time syncing, so if you mute a chat or add a new contact, it shows up everywhere.\n\nNot just WhatsApp: Before now, iMessage already supported multi-device capability exclusively on Apple devices. Telegram does the same but doesn\u2019t provide E2EE. Signal, on the other hand, allows you to connect to up to five devices, but you\u2019ll still need a phone to send and receive messages.\n\nAre your messages still safe? WhatsApp claims they are. You can always kick out devices once you notice they have a different security code.\n\nFor real-time syncing, WhatsApp stores an encrypted version of the information on its server. The platform claims it can never access this information because only your devices have the keys to read it.\n\nEssentially, WhatsApp provides a water cooler where your different devices can meet and swap updates.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s testing this out with a few select users. Is this the proverbial straw that would break the camel\u2019s back? We\u2019ll see.\n\nAkiba Digital raises $1.1 million pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkiba Digital team\n\nSouth African fintech, Akiba Digital has closed a $1.1 million pre-seed round to help it grow its market share in the country and connect over 20,000 Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to lenders through its ecosystem.\n\nThe round was led by California-based Accelerator, Expert DOJO and Nigerian VC firm, Oui Capital. It was supported by Basecamp Fund, Suma Capital, Hustle Fund, Future Africa, LoftyInc and other angel investors.\n\nWhat does Akiba Digital do? Initially launched in 2017 as a savings app by the three co-founders, Tebogo Mokwena, CEO and CTO, Kamogelo Kekana, and Andile Maseko, the startup has since evolved its business model.\n\nCurrently, Akiba Digital claims to enable lenders to extend capital better using alternative datasets to provide inclusive scores to SMEs and individuals that traditional credit bureaus cannot reach.\n\nAkiba Digital claims that this problem affects 80% of small businesses and individuals in Africa. It aims to solve it using its alternative scoring and expand into more than 10 African markets in two to three years. It also hopes to expand to South America and ultimately be one of the continent\u2019s unicorns to exit by 2027.\n\nThe problem of financial inclusion in Africa: As of 2018, the continent\u2019s financial inclusion rate (PDF) was 43%, leaving a whopping 57% either unbanked or underbanked. With little or no access to banking services, most individuals or SMEs have no creditworthiness score. There are no records of their finances, and getting loans becomes a hardship.\n\nWhile digital finance services like mobile money and agency banking have contributed significantly to the rise in Africa\u2019s financial inclusion rate, other issues abound, such as unemployment, lack of awareness and institutional barriers.\n\nDid you see this on Techpoint Africa last week?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nTaiwan\u2019s punishing work culture is forcing young people to game the system.

          "text": "If you\u2019re like me, then your face may be constantly buried in your phone screen. If you\u2019re not scrolling through your favourite social media, you\u2019re having a field day chatting with friends and family.\n\nMost times, I\u2019m scrolling through a sea of cartoonish yellow faces that describe how I feel because sometimes, words aren\u2019t enough.\n\nIn a world where more people work from home and attend events on Zoom, everyone is likely staring at a screen for the better part of the day. How can we not? It\u2019s how we bridge distance barriers and insulate ourselves from a deadly pandemic.\n\nA South African study on changes in how people perceive technology by Alex Emilio Fischer, Tanya Van Tonder, and other researchers reveals 83% of 405 respondents interviewed, worked and communicated more with technology since COVID-19 became a global pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, talking to someone physically differs from conversing using a 6.5\u201d device. When communicating face-to-face, what you don\u2019t say is more important than what you say.\n\nFacial cues and body language speak louder than you can imagine. Lydia Ramsey, Professional Speaker and Author, says that \u201cEye contact is the most obvious way you communicate. When you are looking at the other person, you show interest.\u201d\n\nRamsey claims studies show that words account for 7% of human communication while body language and tone account for 55% and 38%, respectively.\n\nUnfortunately, nowadays, the way we primarily communicate doesn\u2019t accommodate body language. It\u2019s left to collect dust behind computer screens and beneath our typing thumbs.\n\nMelanie Chan, Senior Lecturer, Media, Communication and Culture at Leeds Beckett University, feels technology has reduced face-to-face conversations.\n\nInterestingly, we not only talk through our devices, we also speak to them. Smartphone assistants have become so intelligent that I sometimes find myself asking Google Assistant to tell me jokes when I\u2019m bored.\n\nWhile technology has reduced physical communication, it has also helped us keep in touch where actual meetings are impossible. And with the aid of Japanese invention, emojis, we are perhaps retaining some aspects of normal communication.\n\nEmojis: the language of the digital world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Denis Cherkashin on Unsplash\n\nWhen we click on the emoji section of our keyboard, we likely want to convey emotion easily, or words aren\u2019t enough to say what we feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmojis first appeared on Japanese mobile phones in the late \u201990s. Since then, they have evolved into a universal digital language. In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries named an emoji Word of the Year. Can you guess which one it was? Reply in the comments.\n\nThe popularity of emojis in Japan propelled Google and Apple to have them registered by Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organisation that maintains text standards on computers.\n\nLike the English language, more emojis are being added to the \u201cemoji vocabulary\u201d to express more emotions.\n\nEmojis also have a day set aside to celebrate them. Bizarre? Apparently, World Emoji Day is a big deal.\n\nCreated by Jeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia \u2014 a wiki for emojis \u2014 the day has two main activities: awards are given to the most popular emojis and new ones are announced.\n\nIntriguingly, World Emoji Day is celebrated on July 17 because Apple\u2019s iOS calendar emoji have the same date. Not to worry, you\u2019ll also see the same on your Google keyboard if you\u2019re an Android user.\n\nWhile emojis might be a universal way of communication digitally, it is still perceived differently by people.\n\nWhat do users think of emojis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can lose nuances of humour, seriousness and even sarcasm when we take words at face value.\u201d This is what Folakemi Olaniyan, final year student of English and Literary Studies, said when I asked her how important she felt emojis were.\n\nTo her, emojis help to define the mood and tone of written text. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can chat and not use emojis,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, as much as she wants to, Olaniyan does not use emojis in a formal setting. She prefers chatting on her phone to having a physical conversation, adding that it saves her from stuttering in real life.\n\nIn contrast, Kunle Agbetiloye, a journalist, prefers physical conversations to any form of digital exchange. But, like Olaniyan, he believes emojis give more meaning to words.\n\n\u201cThere are some statements one makes that need an emoji for the receiver to understand the emotion that accompanies it,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, Agbetiloye maintains that emojis are only necessary for informal conversations. \u201cPersonally, if I feel angry, I won\u2019t send you angry emojis because of its cartoonish look.\u201d\n\nTo test his assertion, during a lull in the conversation, I sent him an angry face emoji. True to form, he didn\u2019t take it seriously.\n\nMy chat with Daniel Whyte, another journalist, was filled with emojis. From how the conversation went, I could deduce just how important emojis were.\n\nFor Whyte, emojis help get the message across faster. In his words, \u201cI use it to communicate simple messages quickly. It saves time and flows easily.\u201d He ends this sentence with a smiling face emoji, expressing how casually the words would have flowed from his mouth in a physical conversation.\n\nLike Olaniyan and Agbetiloye, Whyte maintains that emojis should be reserved for casual conversations and kept from official emails.\n\nUniversal but personal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVyvyan Evans, Linguistics Professor and Author of The Emoji Code: Linguistics Behind Smiley Faces and Scaredy Cats, describes emojis as \u201cincontrovertibly the world\u2019s first truly universal form of communication.\u201d\n\nHowever, emojis are used by people from different cultures and with unique personalities, making meaning relative to who is using them. As a result, emoji translators were created.\n\nUsually, the thumbs-up emoji is understood as commendation or approval, but in Greek culture, it\u2019s an offensive gesture.\n\nSurprisingly, the smiling face emoji symbolises dismissiveness to Chinese people rather than happiness.\n\nRanti Omoloso, a recent university graduate, says he has difficulty chatting with older people as they often misunderstand emojis.\n\n\u201cI try to avoid chatting with parents cause they seem to understand emojis very differently. I don\u2019t like typing long sentences, so I just put a call through,\u201d he says.\n\nKeith Broni, who makes a living from translating emojis, says they are \u201clinguistics tools that are being used to complement our language.\u201d\n\nAlthough Broni believes emojis by themselves cannot be a form of communication, he admits that they play a vital role in digital communication.\n\nAn expert\u2019s take\n\nIn the opinion of Dr Oluwakemi Omole, Assistant Director, Counselling and Human Development Centre, Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, communication is an exchange of information, and the medium doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nHighlighting the importance of communication, she says it improves our psychology and sense of self. \u201cIt is very important to our psyche as humans.\u201d\n\nShe also admits that while physical contact feels good, presence \u2014 online or physical \u2014 is what matters most. \u201cYou can be physically present with someone, and you\u2019re not communicating. It\u2019s about exchange and the ability to listen.\u201d\n\nAs a psychologist, Omole says a lot of research has gone into how effective emojis are and if they communicate feelings that cannot be easily expressed in words. She concludes that \u201cemoji is a way of bridging the gap. It is a way of letting people know what you would love to express to them.\u201d\n\nAddressing the question of emojis being a universal language, Omole refutes their ability to be understood universally. \u201cAlthough we feel the same things, the way we express them may differ across cultures.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s World Emoji Day promises the release of emoji 14.0. A new series of emojis that take into account race and gender. With the emoji vocabulary being updated frequently, could they become a stand-alone language?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives has requested that the Federal Government enforce all antitrust laws against the satellite television sector due to the hike in digital TV subscription fees.\n\nWhat does this mean? The laws will keep PayTV services in check, regulate their prices, and reduce the possibility of any provider monopolising the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, the satellite TV sector is dominated by MultiChoice \u2014 the South African company that owns DStv and GOtv \u2014 and Chinese-owned StarTimes.\n\nA trigger? MultiChoice, the market leader, announced an increment in the price of some DStv packages in July 2018, after it did the same for all plans in September 2012 and May 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s not all; there was another increase in May 2020, which the company blamed on the increased Value Added Tax (VAT) rate. At all these times, users and the government alike kicked against the hike.\n\nDespite the opposition, in July 2021, MultiChoice increased the monthly subscription fee of its DStv Compact Plus Package from \u20a610,650 ($25.88) to \u20a612,400 ($30.13).\n\nPer Premium Times, the need to break the satellite TV sector\u2019s monopoly was recognised following the adoption of the report of the ad-hoc committee investigating the non-implementation of pay-per-view rates.\n\nIt goes without saying that MultiChoice\u2019s DStv gets to be at the receiving end of any action resulting from that move.\n\nRecall last week, we reported that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) directed commercial banks to freeze MultiChoice Nigeria Limited and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nPer Vanguard, Nigeria contributes 34% of MultiChoice\u2019s total revenue, Kenya and Zambia contribute 11% and 10% respectively, while the rest of Africa contributes 45%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this goes to show how important the Nigerian market is to the company.\n\nHopefully, the antitrust laws, when enacted will enable more Nigerians to enjoy affordable payTV services.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAIfluence raises $1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Thomas Ulrich from Pixabay\n\nKenyan adtech startup, AIfluence, has raised $1 million in seed investment to invest in its AI-powered influencer marketing platform.\n\nDubai-based EQ2 Ventures led the seed round, and Antler East Africa, Oui Capital, ArabyAds, and an unnamed European family office participated in the round.\n\nWhat about AIfluence? The adtech startup was founded by Nelson Aseka (CEO), George Issaias (CMO), Lamusia Anzaya (COO), and Ankit Jindal (CTO) in 2019. It was set up to accurately match influencers to brands, run end-to-end influencer marketing campaigns, and bring transparency to the measurement of impact.\n\nBuilt on a trust network model, the platform enables advertisers to recruit and manage hundreds to thousands of micro and nano influencers per campaign, resulting in authentic peer-to-peer interactions and higher conversion rates.\n\nHow does it make money? AIfluence generates revenue through brand initiatives that increase product and service awareness and lead generation and conversion campaigns that increase sales.\n\nThe company is currently developing a software as a service (SaaS) product that it claims will put the platform\u2019s power in the hands of its customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Apart from investing in AIfluence\u2019s technology and a SaaS platform, the funds will be used to grow into the rest of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia by the end of 2021.\n\nRead more: Kenyan influencer marketing startup, AIfluence, nets $1m in seed funding for regional expansion\n\nPoS business in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Nigerian streets, urban and rural, have at least one kiosk, with most of them bearing variations of the phrase \u2018PoS is Available\u2019, meaning you can withdraw and send money there.\n\nThere are so many outlets because since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) launched the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy, the PoS business has proven to be quite lucrative.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie: Data released by Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) showed an 859% surge in the volume of PoS transactions during the lockdown between March and April 2020.\n\nAlso, per Statista, the number of PoS payments increased significantly from 34 million in 2015 to 438.6 million in 2019. On the other hand, in 2020, Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) recorded that Nigerian merchants and mobile money operators (MMOs) processed over 655 million PoS transactions valued at \u20a64.7 trillion ($13 billion), a 50% increase from 2019.\n\nPoS outlets are not limited to cash deposits and withdrawals.

          "title": "From immune evasion to vaccine escape, Delta Covid variant poses greater risk",
          "text": "Like a new sheriff in town, the latest coronavirus variant, Delta, is sweeping through the world with a fierce attack on immunity acquired through either earlier infection or vaccination.\n\nIt is quietly slipping through vaccinated people who may not show signs of infection but can still infect others, leading to a dangerous impact on unvaccinated people. In its trail are rising hospitalization levels and death.\n\nA clear statement from the behavioural pattern of this new strain as affirmed by even the World Health Organisation is that: it poses a greater risk with 30 to 60 percent more transmissibility than other variants of concern.\n\nOn average, an infected person will need eight times higher concentrations of antibodies to fight off the new version of the virus compared to the old ones, Morgan Chetty, a professor of health sciences stated in a piece of expert insight.\n\nThe third wave in South Africa, along with neighbouring Namibia, seems to be the worst yet, attributable to the Delta variant as they see up to 30,000 average new cases. In Uganda, the variant was detected in 97 percent of samples while 136 students tested positive for this Covid-19 variant in Ghana.\n\nIt is already rendering some of the most efficacious vaccine brands less effective with individuals showing waning immunity even after vaccination.\n\nThe B.1.617 (Delta) lineage was identified in October 2020 in India and has since then become dominant in some Indian regions and the UK and further spread to more than 100 countries.\n\nRead Also: Covid-19: FG places six States on red alert\n\nResearch published by Nature, a science journal shows that the lineage includes three main subtypes: B1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3, harbouring diverse spike mutations, which may increase their ability to evade immunity.\n\nThe study isolated an infectious Delta strain from a traveller returning from India and examined its sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and to antibodies present in serums from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, in comparison to other viral strains. The researchers found that Delta was resistant to neutralization by some domains, which should normally cripple its effect.\n\nSerums from convalescent patients collected up to 12 months post symptoms were fourfold less potent against the Delta variant, relative to the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7).\n\nSerum from individuals having received one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines barely inhibited the Delta Variant. Administration of two doses generated a neutralizing response in 95 percent of individuals, with antibodies three to fivefold lower against Delta than Alpha.\n\nAs a result, the study concluded that Delta spread is associated with an escape to antibodies.\n\nChetty, a professor at the University of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa agrees also that escape-mutations may drive new resurgence, citing how the B1.1351 variant first identified in South Africa developed changes in the genetic code that makes it more menacing than the original virus. The version contains changes to the re-grow of the spike protein that human antibodies target to fight the virus.\n\n\u201cThe newly reported variants carry the E484K mutation. The mutation was also found in the B.1.1.7 variant that originally was detected in the UK and the B.1.351 and B.1.128 variants that emerged in South Africa and Brazil repeatedly,\u201d Chetty explained.\n\n\u201cThe E484K mutation, which scoops a negatively changed antibody and effectively destroys the binding site. This is likely to make it difficult for antibodies elicited by the old variant to bind the new variant. E484K is called an escape because it helps the mutation escape the immune protection and the virus can slip past the immune defence.\u201d\n\nAnother source, he said could drive escape mutation is the incomplete protection by the vaccine. More variants are found all over the world. Many of them do not significantly change how the virus behaves but some are more potentially dangerous. They make the virus more contagious and could make it more lethal or better at escaping existing vaccines.\n\nThe newest variant of major concern found in India has had a catastrophic impact on infections, mortality and has overwhelmed India\u2019s health system. \u201cThe spread of these variants could mean that the Covid-19 pandemic could be here to stay and maybe the reason why vaccine escape is a major concern,\u201d Chetty said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unvaccinated at risk\n\nMore than 99 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population remains unvaccinated and the country is now among 16 countries that have reported the appearance of the Delta.\n\n\u201cThe variant was detected in a traveller to Nigeria, following the routine travel test required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja,\u201d the National Centre for Disease Control recently said.\n\nThe NCDC has urged all Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place. It advised that public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent handwashing and proper use of facemasks should be followed to prevent infections and save lives.\n\nGiven the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, the NCDC said positive samples from international travellers to Nigeria are frequently sequenced as part of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response.\n\nThe Nigerian government some months ago, placed travel restrictions on countries experiencing a surge in cases associated with variants of concern: India, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey.\n\nNCDC has now urged states to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public. Public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population.\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos State, Nigeria\u2019s epicentre of the disease, also noted that the state had begun to see a steep rise in daily cases, with the positivity rate jumping from 1.1 percent at the end of June to 6.6 percent as of July 8th.\n\nThe general mood is being adjusted more in corporate settings than other places, and if the pattern of old strains emerging in Nigeria is anything to go by, the country might as well scale through without huge losses. However, only time will tell if \u2018luck\u2019 will be enough this time around.",

          "text": "Amid struggles to meet the recapitalisation deadline by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Microfinance Banks (MFBs) grew the most ever loan book in the first quarter (Q1) of 2021.\n\nData from the CBN show that MFBs loan book grew by 67.73 percent \u2013 N2.47 trillion in Q1\u20192021 compared with N1.47 trillion in the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nThe increase in MFBs\u2019 loan was as a result of the CBN\u2019s intervention funds to NIRSAL Microfinance Bank as well as Fintech infusion into MFB business, according to \u200eRogers Nwoke, national president, National Association of Microfinance Banks (NAMB).\n\nNwoke also attributes the loan growth to post-lockdown activities of MFBs, saying that it is all good for the economy.\n\nThe CBN, in March 2020, set up the N50 billion loan facility to be disbursed at single digit through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank for households and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that would be particularly hard hit by COVID-19, including hoteliers, airline service providers, health care merchants, among others.\n\nTwo months ago the CBN revealed that 585,593 beneficiaries had so far received N462.722 billion as of May 28, 2021, from its various intervention schemes to support MSMEs and individuals.\n\nCurrently, the CBN has 37 intervention funds targeted at stimulating the economy and addressing issue of unemployment.\n\nFinancial Technology (FinTech) has transformed the financial landscape, offering wide range of opportunities and spurring new products and services from payments to financing, asset management, insurance and so on.\n\nFor instance, Sparkle, Nigeria\u2019s digital bank, will by September 2021 commence loan services to individuals and small businesses across the country.\n\nRead also: Don\u2019t grant loans, advances, CBN instructs payment service banks\n\nThe digital bank, which provides financial, lifestyle and business support services to Nigerians across the globe, is currently building its engine that would enable loan service delivery.\n\n\u201cWe also want to lend differently to people and we want to lend at a price that is very competitive and not the typical pricing that you see from financial banks,\u201d Uzoma Dozie, founder/CEO, says.\n\nThe MFBs loan book stood at N329.06 billion as of December 2018. Nigeria\u2019s microfinance banks migrated to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\u2019s Standardized Report Form (SRF) in January 2020. The template captures data from December 2018.\n\nResponding to the growth in MFBs\u2019 loan book, Onoja Usman, managing director/CEO, Lovonus Microfinance Bank Limited, states that MFBs loans increased because the response to loans requests and disbursement of loans are faster in MFB than commercial bank.\n\n\u201cMFBs are to support SMEs and the implications on the economy is growth and development,\u201d he says.\n\nTotal assets of Nigeria\u2019s MFBs rose by 38.57 percent to N3.46 trillion in Q1\u20192021 from N2.49 trillion in Q1\u20192019, the CBN data indicate.\n\nKazeem Olanrewaju, managing director/CEO, Baobab Microfinance Limited, notes that growth in risk assets or credits was due to the impact of devaluation since the country rely on importation.\n\nHe says it was also due to the effect of inflation on the economy and associated credit demands, post covid catch up, use of technology that has increased access to credits, and the entrance of new players in the lending space.\n\nOther reasons include low interest on deposit or treasury activities due to CBN policies, banks now create more risk assets, monetary and fiscal policies that make holding cash unattractive and not profitable, and in line with expected growth in risk assets in the banking industry in general.\n\nHowever, as some of the MFBs still struggle to meet up with the recapitalisation deadline set for April 2022 by the CBN, some of the microlenders that have sold off their businesses include Cardinal Rock MFB, Cowries MFB, Aguda Titun MFB, First Ideal MFB, High Street MFB, MoneyWise MFB, Owotutu MFB, Irolu MFB, and Royal Blue MFB, among others.\n\nThe CBN had in October 22, 2018, reviewed upward the minimum capital requirement of the three categories of MFBs as follows \u2013 Unit microfinance banks from N20 million to N200 million, State MFBs from N100 million to N1 billion and the National MFB from N2 billion to N5 billion.\n\nThe CBN has disbursed about N700 billion in various agricultural programmes and as of January 2021, the CBN had disbursed N554.61 billion to 2,849,490 farmers to boost food security under its Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme alone since 2015.\n\nUnder the N1 trillion real sector fund, a total of 234 real sector projects valued at N857. 644 billion were approved and disbursed from November 2018 till May 28.\n\nOf the total 234 projects, 155 real sector projects valued at N615 billion were financed from January 2020 till May 28, 2021: 78 manufacturing projects \u2013 N256 billion; 36 agricultural projects \u2013 N84. 481 billion; 30 Service projects \u2013 N191 billion; and 11 Mining Projects \u2013 N83.5 billion.\n\nData from the CBN show that as of January 2021 till date, N157.517 billion have been disbursed for 29 real sector projects under the Real Sector Support Facility- Differentiated Cash Reserve Requirement (RSSF-DCRR).",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAbuja (NAN) \u2013 The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has given reasons why it has yet to approve any herbal medicine for the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nThis is contained in a statement signed by the agency resident Media Consultant, Mr Olusayo Akintola, and issued to newsmen on Sunday, in Abuja.\n\nThe statement quoted Prof Moji Adeyeye, NAFDAC Director- General, as saying that \u201cno single drug has been found yet to cure COVID -19\u201d.\n\nAdeyeye also warned Nigerians against excessive consumption of onions and garlic with a view to curing COVID-19, saying, \u2018\u2019If you eat too much your breath will be smelling and nobody will want to stay by you.\u201d\n\nShe said that medicinal products available now could only help ease symptoms and up the odds of survival.\n\nShe warned Nigerian researchers and other herbal medicine practitioners to desist from parading unverified medicine for the virus.\n\nShe said that any product without NAFDAC approval for the cure of COVID-19 is null and void, adding that such an act was a violation of the national regulatory authorities and breach of protocols.\n\nShe admitted that onions or garlic or any of the natural fruits that we take have antioxidant and nutrients that can help us feel better, adding that people might have been using it and they get better.\n\n\u201cIf it is not documented, it cannot be recognised by NAFDAC for COVID \u2013 19. They work on our cells to keep people healthier, but not to cure COVID \u2013 19. They help our body to function better. There is no cure for COVID -19 yet.\n\nShe added that they may boost the immunity and the person may not be easily susceptible to infection, adding that \u2018\u2019even with that, you still have to protect yourself.\n\n\u201cIf you eat garlic and onion and you don\u2019t use face mask you will get COVID -19. If you are in a bad environment; If you don\u2019t wash your hands, you will get COVID -19.\n\n\u201cEverything has to be put together. University of Jos said that there was an herbal medicine, whether it is tea or whatever, that can cure COVID-19, they linked it with treatment of COVID -19, they did the packaging.\n\n\u2018\u2019We did a letter to warn them that they cannot claim something unless it has gone through our listing process. They were trying to sell it to their staff. That is violation of our own regulatory policies.\n\n\u201cNobody should say that this one can cure this or that without going through NAFDAC listing process, the research into herbal medicine by the academia is normal.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is now for the academia to also recognise the national regulatory authority established to safeguard the safety of the Nigerian populace, by ensuring that the product that they are working on has to go through NAFDAC,\u201d Adeyeye said.\n\nAccording to her, there have been one or two cases where the University of Jos product was being encouraged to be used by people without going through NAFDAC.\n\nShe said that the university was supposed to go through the national regulatory authority and pave the way for NAFDAC to declare it safe for consumption.\n\nThe DG insisted that her agency must approve the clinical trial protocol, stressing that \u2018\u2019If they don\u2019t do that and go ahead to market and sell their product, such act would be a violation of regulatory procedures.\n\nAccording to her, some people might have been using it and they got better, but without being approved scientifically and documented, we may not be able to guarantee its safety for human consumption.\n\nShe recalled that NAFDAC set up an herbal medicine product committee in March 2019 before the pandemic broke out, to advance research in herbal medicine.\n\nAdeyeye said that the goal for such idea was to make sure that the herbalist and the researcher were collaborating, so that whatever the herbalist knows from ancestral history that the research will back it up.\n\nShe explained further that collaboration with researcher would enable such herbal medicine to be advanced and to be listed by NAFDAC, if found safe for consumption.\n\nAccording to her, during the pandemic there were lots of assertions that there were herbal medicines, that could be used to treat symptoms of COVID -19, pointing out that there was no single medicine that has been identified yet.\n\n\u201cBut there are herbal medicines that could alleviate symptoms of COVID -19. However, NAFDAC has not granted registration of approval for any medicine for that.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC approves such medicines for listing, it means that it\u2019s been tested and was deemed safe to use. NAFDAC cannot say herbal medicine can treat COVID -19, until clinical trial is done.\n\n\u201cRight now, there is no single herbal medicine that has gone through full clinical trial the way clinical trial is supposed to be done,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, to do official clinical trial, you must write a protocol, you must pass it through the National Health Research Ethical Committee (NHREC), and you must pass it through NAFDAC.\u201d\n\nShe said that the agency has not given any pass mark as regards COVID-19 herbal medicine, but that the agency has approved some herbal medicines that they claim can alleviate some of the symptoms of COVID -19.\n\nShe said that some of the approved herbal medicine which they claim can alleviate COVID-19 symptoms only work as immune boosters.\n\nAdeyeye pointed out that such herbal medicine may prevent one from getting the disease, adding that, as far as NAFDAC was concerned, it has not approved any medicine to treat COVID -19.\n\n\u201cWe have approved medicines that they said can alleviate symptoms and relieve people of some symptoms of COVID \u2013 19, when the product is listed then clinical trial may start.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of money to do clinical trial. University of Jos has been given approval to commence clinical trial of their products which is yet to commence.\n\nThe DG further disclosed that many herbal products have been submitted for federal government grants, because most of the herbal practitioners lack the required wherewithal to do clinical trial.\n\nShe said that many of these herbal products were being subjected to review by different agencies of government in the country.\n\n\u201cIn terms of going through clinical trial and official protocols, none has come through yet.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, such herbal products can be used during the clinical trial to investigate whether it could be effective for COVID -19.\n\n...",

Luckily, the gallant pilot of the aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, successfully ejected from the aircraft. Using his survival instincts, the pilot, who came under intense ground fire from the bandits, was able to evade them and sought refuge in nearby settlements awaiting sunset. Using the cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation, Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several bandits\u2019 strongholds and maneuvered his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued. It is instructive to note that upon receipt of the news of the crash, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, had directed that all efforts must be emplaced to rescue the pilot. Accordingly, NAF Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and helicopter gunships provided close air support to NAF Special Forces and Nigerian Army troops who were able to locate the crash site and the pilot\u2019s parachute, while also combing nearby locations for any sign of the pilot. It is gladdening to note that while in hiding, Flight Lieutenant Dairo confirmed that the presence of NAF aircraft within the vicinity of the crash site helped in scaring the bandits who were after him, thus enabling him to find refuge and escape to a safe location. It is important to also recall that only recently, the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, had directed the Armed Forces of Nigeria to do all it takes to flush out criminal elements in Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna States. It is in fulfilment of this directive that the NAF, in conjunction with surface forces, has in the last 2 weeks mounted intensive day and night air interdiction operations against bandits and their hideouts, especially in these 3 states. Through these intensive air operations, hundreds of bandits have been neutralized and several of their hideouts destroyed. Despite the setback of yesterday\u2019s crash, the NAF remains committed towards fulfilling Mr President\u2019s mandate as well as other constitutional roles assigned to it. The willingness, readiness and tested ability of the NAF remains unshaken and unwavering as it continues to carry out its assigned roles. Kindly bring the information to the awareness of the general public.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdward Gabkwet\n\nAir Commodore Director of Public Relations and Information\n\nRead more at: https://prnigeria.com/2021/07/19/naf-pilot-survived-crash/",

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nEither by coincidence or design, Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, has triggered a battle for the soul of Nigeria. And as the country\u2019s all important 2023 general election approaches, it\u2019s no longer just a race to elect another president, but a showdown between the core North and South; an election that could prove a defining moment in country\u2019s chequered history.\n\nAccused of pursuing unbridled nepotism, the kind many say they never witnessed in the country, the Buhari government has been an eye-opener; a sudden reminder that Nigeria is still a country in transition and not a settled secular state. Ethnic and religious tensions are at all-time high; instigated, many say, by the president himself, who has shown, in appointments and everything else, clear preference for people of his religion and region.\n\n\u201cThe President has blatantly pursued nepotistic agenda and policies that show very clearly his preference for men and women of his faith,\u201d Matthew Kukah, Bishop of Catholic Diocese of Sokoto told US Congress Commission on Thursday.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in Nigeria, the people heading the three arms of government \u2013 President, Senate President, Speaker and Chief Justice \u2013 are all Muslims. These are all fine gentlemen, but that is not the point. The level of rivalry between Christians and Muslims has worsened. This kind of situation has never happened before.\u201d\n\nThe presidency has, meanwhile hit back at the Catholic clergy, accusing him of promoting division; while insisting, in a statement by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, that the constitution of Nigeria does not say there must be a balance between Muslims and Christians in appointments.\n\nSince Buhari took office on May 29, 2015, he has ensured that virtually all strategic position in government are held by people of his religion and region. At the moment, from key revenue generating agencies of the government, such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA); to key security agencies such as the Army, Police, Civil Defence, State Security Service, National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), etc., are head by individuals from the North, just as people from the region make up the bulk of the staff in the agencies.\n\nNigerians on social media now joke about how visiting EFCC or NPA office in Lagos feels like being in Kano.\n\nThe above, in addition to the fact that all three arms of government: Executive, Judiciary and the Legislature, are headed by people of the same region, first time in Nigeria\u2019s history, have caused ripples in the polity. Accusations of Buhari pursuing northern agenda keep getting validated, it would seem, by the president\u2019s actions. And ahead of 2023, many say, the stakes are much higher.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what the president has done, it\u2019s all about cementing ethnic hegemony,\u201d said Abuja based lawyer and analyst, Chidi Ezeugo \u201cHis idea is to ensure that his people not only take over the country politically, but also physically.\n\n\u201cBy his appointments, he has since ensured that politically, his people have taken over. Now, to also ensure that they take over physically, he has been pursuing Ruga, grazing reserve, Water Resources Bill among others. Imagine that Nigerians allowed Ruga for example, it means that they be able to export their people and change the entire demographics of the country.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Buhari\u2019s quest to create settlements for herders in all the states of the federation, through Ruga, had triggered national outrage, forcing him to suspend the project. Had the programme scaled through, there would have been settlements for cattle herders of Fulani stock in every locality in the country, on lands gazetted by the federal government, and therefore theirs forever. Yet, the quest to create settlements for wandering herders did not start with Ruga, neither did end with it, if indeed it has ended.\n\nIt had, of course, started with the introduction of the infamous grazing reserve bill sponsored by Senator Zanaib Kure from Niger State, but it was killed in the 7th Senate when it was introduced. It was yet reintroduced in the 8th senate, sponsored by Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso (Kano Central), among others, as \u201cNational Grazing Reserves Agency (establishment etc) Bill 2016 (SB.292.\u201d\n\nDescribed by many as the most obnoxious bill ever introduced in Nigeria\u2019s upper legislative chamber, the bill sought to map out vast areas of lands in all the states of the country as grazing areas for herders. It generated outrage. Many alleged it was a ploy to seize lands from indigenous Nigerians and hand them over to Fulani from all over west Africa to settle in possible bid to alter demographics. The outrage caused the Senator Bukola Saraki led senate to throw the bill out.\n\nBuhari yet in 2017 presented another controversial bill to the National Assembly, the water resources bill, which sought to transfer the control of water resources from states to the Federal Government.\n\nAmong other things, the bill proposed that water usage be subjected to licensing provisions and that the licence may be cancelled if the licensee \u201cfails to make beneficial use of the water.\u201d\n\nThe bill also stated that all landlords must obtain a driller permit before sinking a borehole in their homes, and directs persons who have excess supply of water to cater for their domestic needs to reduce the quantity to what they can consume.\n\nAccording to the bill, only authorised personnel may carry out routine checks to inspect water usage or water disposal on properties with the production of their identity card or other instrument or certificate of designation if so required.\n\nBy its provision, the federal government will get control and power of licencing of all 267.3billion cubic metres of surface water and 51,9 billion metres of groundwater, including all 200 damns storing up to 11 billion cubic metres of water in Nigeria. It would also include control of boreholes, control River Niger, Oguta Lake, Lake Chad, Lullemeden Aquifer System, Tano and Keta Aquifer System and Lake chad, among others.\n\nExpectedly, it generated outrage. Many alleged it was yet another ploy to secure water bodies and surrounding lands for herders, and owing to the outrage, the eight senate threw it out.\n\nHowever, Chairman of the House Committee on Rules and Business, Abubakar Fulata, moved a motion on July 23, 2020, calling for the reopening of 11 bills, including the water resources bill, not passed by the eighth Assembly.\n\nFulata had prayed that the bills be withdrawn from the committees they were referred to and considered by the Committee of the Whole, as the panels had failed to meet their deadlines. The motion was unanimously adopted. And an interview on September 7, Fulata described the passage of the bill as a done deal, saying the process would not be reversed.\n\nWhen the public got wind of it, many called for its withdrawal, with Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom describing it as \u201cevil bill,\u201d while vowing to lead protest against it.\n\nWhen the matter eventually came up on the floor of the house on Tuesday September 29, 2020, members of the House from the core North and their counterparts from the South and North Central engaged in a shouting match. Members of the House, mostly from the South had raised various legal and procedural issues on the bill, arguing that it be withdrawn a properly gazetted for debate.\n\nBut their argument was opposed by members from the North who insisted that passage of the bill was a done deal and could not be reversed.\n\nThe clash began when a member from Benue State, Mr Bem Mzondu, raised a point of order, under Order 6 Rule 1(2) and (3), alleging that his legislative privilege was breached as the bill did not follow the due process and that a copy was not made available to him.\n\nRuling on the matter, Gbajabiamila pointed out that matters of privilege were not meant to be debated, but he allowed comments due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe Speaker had recalled how accelerated passage of the controversial Control of Infectious Diseases Bill was met either stiff resistance by members of the public, forcing the House to reverse the process and subject it to a public hearing.\n\nThe latest water resources bill controversy had yet come after Ruga, which was announced in July 2019, as a programme for the establishment of settlement for herders in every state of federation, a move that immediately sparked furry, coming at a time allegations of \u2018Northernisation\u2019 and \u2018Fulanisation\u2019 agenda had become rife, fuelled also by the administration\u2019s seeming unwillingness to reign in on the same herders carrying out killings of genocidal proportions in parts of the country, mostly in the Middle Belt region.\n\nAmid the criticisms, Presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu further stoked the fire. He issued a statement calling those opposing the move of playing \u201cpolitics\u201d and \u201chowling,\u201d while describing their comments as \u201cunhelpful\u201d and insisting that \u201cthe plan to stop roaming of cattle herders with the attendant clashes with farmers.\u201d\n\nHe had said, \u2018\u201cRuga Settlement\u2019 that seeks to settle migrant pastoral families simply means rural settlement in which animal farmers, not just cattle herders, will be settled in an organized place with provision of necessary and adequate basic amenities such as schools, hospitals, road networks, vet clinics, markets and manufacturing entities that will process and add value to meats and animal products.\u201d\n\nShehu\u2019s statement triggered yet another round of anger. Archbishop Emeritus of Lagos, His Eminence, Anthony Cardinal Olubunmi Okogie described his claim that the Ruga settlement was to solve \u201cfarmers herders clashes,\u201d as \u201cinsolence\u201d and an insult to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt amounts to a gratuitous insult on the intelligence of those who know the history of this country to say: \u201cRUGA settlement that seeks to settle migrant pastoral families,\u201d Okojie had said. \u201cOur history, especially in the pre-colonial era, shows how such \u201csettlements\u201d for \u201cmigrant pastoral families\u201d have been used to dispossess people of their ancestral land, used to disturb peaceful co-existence in our multi-ethnic country. Have we not been told in recent memory that if we want peace we must give land to violent herdsmen?\u201d\n\nForemost Ife monarch, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi and Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, in a joint statement told Nigerians to defend their lands against any attempt to cede them to anyone for Ruga settlements. Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams described it as an \u201cAfonja scenario,\u201d vowing that the Yoruba will never forgive any governor who accepts it, while Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere, PANDEF, Middle Belt Forum, among others, vigorously opposed the move, and eventually the government announced its suspension.\n\nBut the suspension failed to assuage anger. Taraba State governor, Darius Ishaku insisted that Ruga was a form of colonialism that must be cancelled outright. \u201cRuga is colonialism; it is not about cattle; it is not even about grasses. It should not only be suspended, but it should also be cancelled completely,\u201d he had said.\n\nGradually, attention shifted from Ruga National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) which the government subsequently inaugurated to replace Ruga. Again, the plan was opposed by many who saw it as another form Ruga.\n\nSoon after details of the plan became public knowledge, Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) issued a joint statement in Abuja saying that the plan didn\u2019t make any economic sense, even as they alleged that there was an agenda behind it.\n\n\u201cMeeting restates the rejection of SMBLF to the use of the collective resources of Nigerians to convert herdsmen, majority of whom are non-Nigerians, from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles while doing their private business that has nothing to do with the rest of us beyond being their market. It is akin to government making budgetary allocations to Coca Cola to produce drinks to sell to Nigerians,\u201d the statement had said.\n\nBenue State stakeholders also rejected the plan, alleging that its details show that it is nothing but Ruga settlements labelled with different name.\n\nWater Resources Bill Returns:\n\nLast week, it emerged that President Buhari has re-submitted water resources bill, with some activists asking Nigerians to be vigilant.\n\nIndeed, while speaking at a ceremony for the commissioning of the Zobe Regional Water Supply Scheme in Katsina State on Thursday, Buhari called for a speedy implementation of the bill, as according to him, his administration will work towards ensuring that all Nigerians, irrespective of location in the country, have access to adequate potable water supply and sanitation facilities as enshrined in the SDG target.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is where the need for quick passage of the National Water Resources Bill that made provision for the National WASH Fund, as well as regulatory environment for private sector involvement in the sector, become relevant.\n\n\u201cI therefore call on the National Assembly to give attention to the Bill towards its passage into law as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nOpposition to the move is again mounting. Some observers insist that the president has hidden agenda.\n\nSpeaking in an interview at the weekend, Ortom once again asked lawmakers to oppose the bill, insisting that it is evil, and an evident that the Buhari government doesn\u2019t mean well for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNow everyone can see clearly that the APC led administration does not mean well for citizens of this country, the Water Resource Bill that was resisted by Nigerians and even the National Assembly has been reintroduced, for what?,\u201d he wondered.\n\nAccording to him, the bill is only meant to replace RUGA settlement for herdsmen, cattle colony, as well as encourage open grazing.\n\nSimilarly, former managing director of the Daily Times, Chief Tola Adeniyi, told Business Hallmark that the, \u201cwater resources bill is nauseating.\u201d\n\nAdeniyi warned that, \u201cIf governors from the South and Middle Belt cannot talk, it is their funeral. If members of the National Assembly from the South, the Middle Belt and Northeast, fail to stop it, then it is their funeral. That\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that there is a tiny section of the country trying to run roughshod because they are united, while wondering why others cannot also come together to save themselves.\n\n\u201cA tiny section of the country is riding them roughshod because they are united, but if they (other groups) want to sit back and watch it happen, they they should bear the blame.\u201d\n\nThat unity appear to be what is crystallising ahead of 2023 polls, as different groups in the South and Middle Belt appear to be bonding to resist what many interpret as an agenda of the Buhari north to dominate the country; a scenario that has now pitted the two sides against the other going into election.\n\nFor the first time in Nigeria\u2019s democratic history, governors of 17 states in the South have formed a forum to take common position on issues that affect the country, and after their meeting in Lagos a fortnight ago on June 5, issued a communique, asking, among other things, that in the interest of equity and fairness, power should return to the South.\n\n\u201cThe Forum reiterates its commitment to the politics of equity, fairness and unanimously agrees that the presidency of Nigeria be rotated between Southern and Northern Nigeria and resolved that the next president of Nigeria should emerge from the Southern Region,\u201d chairman of the Southern governor\u2019s forum, Rotimi Akeredolu, read in the communique.\n\nThe governors\u2019 position was backed by the Southern and Middle Belt Forum, as well Benue governor, Ortom, from the North Central Region, who also expressed support for their decision to ban open grazing in the region, among other groups and individuals in the South and Middle Belt.\n\nBut it has attracted backlash from the North, with groups such Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) arguing in opposite direction.\n\nNEF through its spokesman, Dr. Hakim Baba-Ahmed insisted that Northerners will not allow their right to choose who they want to govern, to be constrained by anyone.\n\nSimilarly, former secretary general of the ACF, Anthony Sani argued that there is no justification for insistence on Southern presidency, as according to him, zoning is only party affair, and not provided for in the constitution.\n\nThe battle has officially begun with the electoral act amendment bill recently passed by the National Assembly. Events of the past few days have rattled many. It had emerged that the senate introduced total ban of electronic transmission of votes, a key aspect of the amendment in the electoral process canvassed by Nigerians with a view to checking fraud often associated with collation of results.\n\nElectronic transmission of results was the major source of controversy in the electoral system in the 2019 presidential election. The opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, had maintained that by results transmitted electronically, they won the presidential election. But the APC and the electoral body insisted that no votes were transmitted electronically, as there was no law permitting the process. In the end, the Supreme Court upheld Buhari\u2019s victory at the polls.\n\nPrior to the election, an electoral act amendment bill passed by Saraki led eight senate, presented to Buhari, which had provided for electronic voting and electronic transmission of results, was sat on by the president who claimed that the election had become too close at the time and that signing the bill into law could distort the process.\n\nThe president\u2019s refusal to assent to the bill, eventually provided the loophole that allowed for what many believed was the manipulation of the 2019 polls. And with the attempt to remove electronic transmission of vote in the new bill, observers say the APC and Buhari may be plotting to retain power by the same token in 2023.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, with what is happening, that the APC is planning to rig the election in 2023, to retain power irrespective of how Nigerians feel,\u201d said Chief Abia Onyike, spokesperson for Alaigbo Development Foundation. \u201cBut my take is that they won\u2019t be able to the because the APC is not united. Who are they going to rig the election in favour of?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian people want a situation where the electoral process can be more open and more democratic. The people in the national assembly who are agents of the hegemonic forces in Nigeria have blocked the passage of the electoral bill which has provided for electronic transmission of results. But they will one day regret their actions.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers spent more than three hours considering over 100 clauses of the bill, and the majority of the senators succeeded in empowering the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to determine the electronic transmission of electoral results.\n\nThe legislation is seeking to repeal and re-enact the 2010 electoral act, which has been under consideration for years.\n\nDuring the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill, Sabi Abdullahi, deputy senate whip, proposed that the NCC must certify that national coverage is adequate and secure, while the national assembly must approve before the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) can transmit election results electronically.\n\nBut Albert Bassey, senator representing Akwa Ibom north-east, kicked against the motion and said the initial proposal made by the committee should be retained.\n\n\u201cThe commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable,\u201d section 50 (3) of the report reads.\n\nThis led to a rowdy session which lasted about 20 minutes, after which the senate eventually retained Abdullahi\u2019s amendment after a 52-28 vote.\n\nTwenty-eight legislators were absent.\n\nWhile the \u2018NO\u2019 vote was to empower NCC determine e-transmission of electoral results, the \u2018YES\u2019 was to retain the aforementioned section 50(3) as recommended by the committee.\n\nAll APC senators on the floor voted \u201cNO,\u201d while all PDP senators voted \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe opposing senators, who are presently facing backlash from Nigerians, were said to have been lobbied by the presidency to reject the electronic transmission of results, with assurances that state resources would be deployed to ensure their reelection in 2023.\n\nThis is even as INEC, through its spokesman, Festus Okoye, has said it has the capacity to transmit results from even the remotest parts of the country.",

The church reportedly welcomes more than 50,000 parishioners every week.\n\nJoel\u2019s weekly televised sermons have been averaging around 7 million people per week and reaching 20 million per month.\n\nSome of his most popular books are Your Best Life Now, Become A Better You, and many more. He has written 15 books so far in his career.\n\nHowever, Joel also lives in a 17,000 square-foot mansion in a wealthy suburb named River Oaks in Houston. His property is estimated to be worth $10.5 million.",

          "text": "A pilot with the Nigerian Airforce, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, has been rescued after intense gunfire by armed bandits grounded a Nigerian Airforce Alpha Jet aircraft in Zamfara State.\n\nThe Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore, Edward Gabkwet, who confirmed the crash in a statement on Monday, said Dairo was returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna states when the aircraft came under attack and crashed.\n\nHe stated that Dairo escaped when he ejected from the aircraft before it crashed, adding that when he landed, the armed bandits gave him a hot chase.\n\nGabkwet said, \u201cOn July 18, 2021, around 12.45 pm, a Nigerian Air Force Alpha Jet aircraft, returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna states, came under intense enemy fire which led to its crash in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cLuckily, the gallant pilot of the aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, successfully ejected from the aircraft. Using his survival instincts, the pilot, who came under intense ground fire from the bandits, was able to evade them and sought refuge in nearby settlements awaiting sunset.\n\n\u201cUsing the cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation, Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several bandits\u2019 strongholds and maneuvered his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that upon receipt of the news of the crash, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, had directed that all efforts must be emplaced to rescue the pilot.\u201d\n\nGabkwet stated that the NAF Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance platforms and helicopter gunships provided close air support to NAF Special Forces and Nigerian Army troops who were able to locate the crash site and the pilot\u2019s parachute, while also combing nearby locations for any sign of the pilot.\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is gladdening to note that while in hiding, Flight Lieutenant Dairo confirmed that the presence of NAF aircraft within the vicinity of the crash site helped in scaring the bandits who were after him, thus enabling him to find refuge and escape to a safe location.\n\n\u201cIt is important to also recall that only recently, the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, had directed the Armed Forces of Nigeria to do all it takes to flush out criminal elements in Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna states.\n\n\u201cIt is in fulfilment of this directive that the NAF, in conjunction with surface forces, has in the last 2 weeks mounted intensive day and night air interdiction operations against bandits and their hideouts, especially in these three states. Through these intensive air operations, hundreds of bandits have been neutralized and several of their hideouts destroyed.\n\n\u201cDespite the setback of yesterday\u2019s crash, the NAF remains committed to fulfilling Mr President\u2019s mandate as well as other constitutional roles assigned to it. The willingness, readiness, and tested ability of the NAF remain unshaken and unwavering as it continues to carry out its assigned roles.\u201d",

          "text": "According to the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), the Muslim community in Oyo State will patiently wait until 2023 to ensure that Governor Seyi Makinde does not seek re-election.\n\nThe group made the assertion while disputing Makinde\u2019s claim that the Bodija Mosque, one of the state\u2019s mosques, was erected on land set aside for a recreation center.\n\nMURIC had previously accused Makinde of initiating a deliberate, well-planned, and progressive removal of Islamic landmarks from the state.\n\nAfter it was reported that the State Government had allocated a Muslim \u2018Id praying area in Bodija, Ibadan, for the development of a leisure centre, the organization made the complaint.\n\nIn response to MURIC\u2019s claim, the Governor remarked that \u201cpart of the property that was designated as a recreation centre since the formation of Bodija Estate was used to build a mosque and a church\u201d through his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s claim is untrue, according to MURIC, because Bodija Muslims purchased the land on which the mosque was built and also engaged the power authority to relocate the tension wires on the property.\n\nOn Monday, MURIC released a statement signed by its Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola.\n\n\u201cThe governor claimed that \u2018Part of the land which was designed as a recreation centre since the creation of Bodija Estate was used to build a mosque and a church.\n\n\u201cThis is a blatant lie. The governor has made it look as if the Oyo State Government gave the Muslims the parcel of land on which Bodija mosque was built,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMURIC further accused Makinde of trying to divert the attention from the Muslim praying ground to the mosque whereas the issue in contention is the former.\n\nThe Islamic rights group said that its earlier accusation against the governor was that he was trying to seize the Muslim praying ground and not the mosque, wondering why Makinde is turning the matter round.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow Makinde to play the game according to his own rules. So we are not discussing the mosque,\u201d MURIC said.\n\nThe group said that Makinde shot himself in the foot by trying to manoeuver his way out of the question, adding that he inadvertently admitted that he is building a recreation centre.\n\n\u201cMr. Governor Sir, in what location are you building your recreation centre? Is it not on the Muslim praying ground? But that was exactly what we accused you of doing. Statements like \u2018The new construction will not in any way tamper with the existing mosque in the area\u2019 is not only diversionary. It is deceitful. Nigerians are not fools,\u201d MURIC added.\n\n\u201cMakinde is simply afraid of his own shadow because MURIC has never been known to foment trouble.\u201d\n\nMURIC noted that the only language that politicians such as Makinde understand \u2018is the next election\u2019, \u201cOyo State Muslims spoke to the late Bola Ige in the language he understood. The latter lost his second term election.\n\n\u201cOyo State Muslim Community will speak to Makinde in the language he understands. The clock is ticking,\u201d the group threatened.",

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",

          "text": "There is consensus amongst Nigerians that the country is at war, hence the urgent need by government, military and other security agencies to improve the competence of the fighting force through training and retraining, as well as procure modern military armaments with a view to silencing the enemies of the state to ensure peace and sustainable development, writes our Defence correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\nIn the past one decade or more, the Nigerian State has fought hard to subjugate bands of terrorists seizing territories in the Northeast and making life unbearable for inhabitants of the six states that make up the geo-political zone and by extension the entire nation.\n\nRegrettably, the northeast is not alone in these barbaric killings and acts of arson against the state, as the Northwest and North Central are also faced with crude and brute bloodletting by armed bandits and marauding herdsmen.\n\nAlso, the sessecionists\u2019 agitation in the South East and South West, as well as the resource control conundrum in the South-South have turned the country into multiple theatres of operations and massive killing fields.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian Government in whose shoulder rests the responsibility of protecting life and property can not be said to be sleeping on duty as the effort of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) whose constitutional role it is to protect the nation\u2019s territorial integrity has also not reneged on this responsibility, though there is room for improvement on what it has been able to accomplish thus far in keeping the nation one.\n\nComplain of lack of modern military hardware to match the firepower of the terrorist and other enemies of the state in the country abounds, however, the Government is doing something to bridge that noticeable gap.\n\nOnly last week, the Nigerian Air Force announced through a statement by its spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, that the United States of America has finally released the first batch of the long-awaited Super Tucano to Nigeria to boost the fight against insurgency and other sundry criminalities across the Federation.\n\nThis good news also comes with some responsibility on the part of the Nigerian Air Force NAF as modern military armaments without skillful manpower amount to effort in futility.\n\nTherefore, there is a need for continued training and retraining of personnel to enable it to undo the enemies who are confronting the state with asymmetric warfare.\n\nIt is however on the premise of this reality that the Nigerian Pilot is ex-raying the dichotomy between human skills and military armaments in a war situations.\n\nSome experts believe that modern military armaments without skillful manpower to man them are equal to mere wish without commensurate results.\n\nValidating this proposition, the Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Oladayo Amao said that the most critical airpower capability, that must be enhanced and sustained for effective\n\nand efficient performance is the human being that operates the air platforms.\n\nAir Marshal Amao supported the above proposition at the winging ceremony of 6 new pilots that just completed their flying training in the United Kingdom.\n\nExpressing delight at the winging of another set of new Nigerian Air Force (NAF) helicopter pilots, the Chief of Air Staff said the winging of the six pilots is yet another step towards the actualization of his vision of \u201cenhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for joint\n\nforce employment in pursuit of our national security imperatives\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn my view, the most critical airpower capability, that must be enhanced and sustained for effective and efficient performance, is the human being that operates the air platforms. It is against this background that the\n\n\u2018pursuit of purposeful training and human capacity development\u2019 was specifically selected as one of the key drivers of my Vision.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have continued to accord high priority to purposeful training as a major tool for human capacity development. This is based on the premise that, for the NAF to function efficiently, both as a highly technical Service and as a fighting force for the effective defense of Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, it must have the right\n\nnumerical strength and, more importantly, the right quality of\n\nmanpower in all relevant competencies.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, many other pilots, as well as personnel from other specialties, are attending various training courses both at home and abroad. These efforts are expected to place the Service in a dominant position to more effectively deliver on its constitutional role, especially in the light of our involvement in several internal security operations across the country\u201d.\n\nGiving the statistics on those currently undergoing different types of training to enhance the overall performance of the Service, the Chief of Air Staff noted that the NAF has a total of 195 officers and airmen/airwomen undergoing various training courses abroad\n\ncutting across several specialties and trades.\n\n\u201cOut of this number, 4 student pilots are currently undergoing similar helicopter training at Draken Europe Helicopter Academy, United Kingdom, the same institution where the pilots winged today graduated. In the same vein, 4 other student pilots are in the Czech Republic undergoing basic fighter training on the L-39 aircraft, while 5 student pilots are undergoing helicopter training at United States Army Aviation Facility, Fort Rucker, USA.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, there are 17 student pilots in South Africa undergoing Basic Transport Pilot Training. There is also an officer undergoing Helicopter Pilot Training in India. Locally, there are 12 student pilots undergoing Basic Fighter Training at 403 FTS, Kano, while 10 others are undergoing Basic Transport Training at 401 FTS, Kaduna. All these courses are aimed at maintaining combat readiness by increasing the number of pilots to man our existing platforms, including the 26 aircraft acquired by the Federal Government in the past 6 years,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAir Marshal Amao further explained that \u201cThe Nigerian Air Force has also continued to build capacity for the several other aircraft types that have been newly acquired and are expected to be delivered before the end of the year. For instance, about 60 NAF personnel, comprising pilots, engineers, technicians, and other specialists, recently completed their training on the A-29 Super Tucano aircraft in the USA. This is in preparation for the arrival of 6 aircraft that departed the United States for Nigeria three days ago. They are expected to arrive in Nigeria before the end of the month.\n\n\u201cThe other six are also expected to arrive in Nigeria by September 2021. The overall effect of these efforts is that the\n\nNAF, operating in synergy with sister Services and other security agencies, will be better positioned to more effectively\n\ncounter both domestic and foreign threats to the nation\u2019s security and the wellbeing of our people\u201d.\n\nCongratulating the young pilots for successfully completing the training, Air Marshal Amao charged them to be relentless in the pursuit of excellence and professionalism as operational pilots while working with their\n\ncolleagues across other specialties in the Service.\n\nHe equally counseled them to always strive to imbibe the doctrine of jointness and esprit de corps in the forward lines as they interact with personnel from\n\nsister Services and other security agencies in various theatres of operations nationwide for more enduring results.\n\nAppreciating President Buhari for his continued support to the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) the CAS also commend the Chief of Training and Operations as well as the Director of Training and all others, who played different roles in the training of\n\nthese young pilots.\n\nHe tasked them to remain totally focused and committed to the successful execution of our constitutional role of defending the territorial integrity of our dear nation.\n\nEarlier in his address of welcome, the Chief of Training and Operations (NAF), Air Vice Marshal James Gwani said that\n\nthe winging was in line with the key drivers of the Chief of the Air Staff, which is to pursue purposeful training and human capacity development.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Air Force has spared no effort in ensuring that its personnel is well trained to meet her professional needs.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, this morning we would be witnessing yet another winging ceremony under the administration of the current Chief of the Air Staff has recently conducted a similar event for four pilots on 27 Apr 21. This is an indication of the commitment of the CAS to ensure continuous human capacity development of NAF Personnel through high quality and intensive training cutting across all fields and specialties in the NAF,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe disclosed that the pilots that were winged are Flying Officer TE Adebayo and 5 others who recently completed their basic flying training to become helicopter pilots.\n\nAVM Gwani further disclosed that the pilots were trained at Draken Helicopter Academy formerly known as Cobhams Aviation Services in the United Kingdom which also trains helicopter pilots for the UK Armed Forces and other Armed forces like Australia and Saudi Arabia amongst others.\n\nGiving a brief highlight on the flying training course the officers have successfully completed, the Chief of Training and Operations said: \u201cFlying Officer TE Adebayo and 5 others attended the Basic Helicopter Flying Course at the Draken Helicopter Academy in the United Kingdom from 27 Feb 20 to 20 June 21. The training was conducted in 3 phases; Basic Rotary Wing Phase, Operational Rotary Wing Phase, and Conversion Phase. The officers flew an average of 75 hours on the Cabri-G2 helicopter and 16 hours on the Flight Simulator Training Device in the Basic Rotary Wing Phase\u201d.\n\nHe revealed that at the end of the first phase which focused on basic helicopter flying techniques, the officers carried out a License skills test and were issued with a Helicopter Private Pilot License.\n\nGiving further details on the training the Chief of Training and Operations (NAF) said, \u201cthey then proceeded to the operational rotary-wing phase which covered combat search with rescue patterns, tactical formation, reversionary night flying & night vision goggles, night medium & low-level navigation amongst others. The officers flew an average of 60 hours on the AS-350 Squirrel helicopter as well as two hours Instrument Landing systems on the Bell-412. The final phase of the training which was the AW109E helicopter conversion involved 9 hours of flying. In all, the officers had an average of 150 hours on the Cabri-G2, AS350 Squirrel, Bell 412 and AW109E helicopters\u201d.\n\nOn the significance of their training in the ongoing counter-terrorism and anti-banditry operations, AVM Gwani averred: \u201cThese young officers have gone through the rigors of flying training, and their presence here today is a testament of the quality of training pursued by the NAF. Furthermore, their inclusion into the pilot\u2019s corps would no doubt boost the strength of pilots especially as the NAF is inducting and expecting more rotary and fixed-wing platforms to embark on daring missions in the face of the various security challenges across the country\u201d.",

          "text": "There was anxiety and palpable fear in the military circle on Sunday evening, as news of another air mishap involving a Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Alpha Jet was reported by some online news portals.\n\nThe online platforms had claimed that the location of the crash was \u201csomewhere in Kaduna State\u201d.\n\nSources told the medium that the aircraft type involved in the latest air mishap was an Alpha jet.\n\n\u201cThe fighter jet left Yola, the Adamawa capital, this morning to go clear bandits,\u201d the source told the online medium.\n\nHowever, the Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, denied the report, saying there was no report of a crash within the Kaduna general area.\n\nIn an update at the NAF WhatsApp platform, the NAF Spokesperson explained that no aircraft left Yola for Kaduna as claimed in the trending report.\n\nCommodore Gabkwet however, reiterated that he is making contact and awaiting information from other locations.\n\nIf this air mishap is finally confirmed, it will bring a total of four air crashes involving military aircraft in seven months.\n\nRecall that Nigeria Beechcraft King Air B350i (NAF 201), crashed in Abuja on 21 of February 2021 killing all crew members on board.\n\nThe then Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force (NAF) , AVM Ibikunle Daramola while giving an update on the tragic incidence said the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), earlier today, 21 February 2021, confirmed that one of its aircraft, a Beechcraft KingAir B350i (NAF 201), crashed while returning to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja after reporting engine failure en route Minna, where it was scheduled to conduct surveillance missions over Niger State and its environs in connection with the concerted efforts to secure the release of the students/staff abducted from the Government Science College Kagara, Niger State.\n\nAs if that was not enough sorrows, tears, and blood, on the 31 of March 2021, less than one month after the first tragedy, another one struck, but this time around in the Theatre of war.\n\nAnnouncing the ugly incidence, the Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet in a statement said the NAF Alpha Jet aircraft, was reported missing in Borno State on 31 March 2021 after losing radar contact.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe attention of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has been drawn to some videos being circulated on Social Media, as well as media reports drawn therefrom, alleging that the NAF Alpha Jet aircraft, which was reported missing in Borno State on 31 March 2021 after losing radar contact, was shot down by terrorists. One of such videos, in particular, began with sporadic shooting by several terrorists, including underaged children on motorcycles and vehicles. It later skipped abruptly to a scene depicting an aircraft exploding mid-air, supposedly as a result of enemy action. Another part of the video showed a terrorist, who, while standing by the wreckage, claimed that they had shot down the NAF aircraft.\n\nPainfully, while the above crash was yet to be resolved by the military, the mother of all military crashes happened in Kaduna.\n\nConfirming the air crash that killed the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt Gen Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 other military personnel, the Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima in a statement said, \u201cThe Nigerian Army regrets to announce the passing away of its Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Ibrahim Attahiru . The sad event occurred following an air crash in Kaduna which also claimed the lives of 10 other officers including the crew.\n\nThe COAS was en route to Kaduna from Abuja on Friday, 21 May 2021 when the unfortunate incident happened\u201d.\n\n18 out of the 20 victims of the NAF, perennial air mishap have since been buried, the latest being the burial of the Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Ibrahim Attahiru and ten others on Saturday, 22 May 2021.\n\nThe fate of the crew members for the Alpha Jet aircraft (NAF475) that crashed on the 31, March 2021, in the Northeast theatre of operation is still hanging in the balance.",

He was jailed on July 8.\n\n\u2013 Seeking another delay \u2013\n\nSouth Africa was then plunged into chaos, with looting and rioting erupting in KwaZulu-Natal, before spreading to the economic hub of Johannesburg in Gauteng province, claiming more than 200 lives.\n\nThe unrest was widely seen as at least partially in response to Zuma\u2019s imprisonment.\n\nThe trial is resuming virtually to avoid more \u201cdisruption\u201d, the National Prosecuting Authority told AFP, although other court cases are also being heard online due to the pandemic.\n\nBut Zuma\u2019s legal team claims the online format is unconstitutional and has applied for the trial to be adjourned.\n\nHis lawyer Dali Mpofu argued Zuma was being denied the right to a \u201cpublic trial in front of an ordinary court\u201d, to be physically present and consult his defence.\n\nHe said the unrest was \u201cunforeseen\u201d and asked Judge Piet Koen to push back proceedings by \u201ctwo or three weeks.\u201d\n\nZuma\u2019s legal team has meanwhile also demanded that chief prosecutor Billy Downer recuse himself from the case over claims he leaked information to the media.\n\nDowner has accused them of delaying tactics, which Mpofu vehemently denied.\n\nMonday\u2019s hearing could reignite tensions that had eased by the weekend, analysts warn.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Teflon president\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe charismatic ex-leader has retained a fervent support base within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party and among the general public.\n\nHis followers portray him as a man of the people and a defender of the poor.\n\n\u201cPeople will be watching the behaviour of judges,\u201d said Sipho Seepe, a fellow of the University of Zululand in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\n\u201cIf they feel justice is not done, they will protest.\u201d\n\nZuma and his backers have repeatedly dismissed the scrutiny of the ex-president\u2019s conduct as politically motivated and warned his jailing would spark unrest.\n\nBut they deny being behind the recent turmoil.\n\nZuma once dubbed the \u201cTeflon president\u201d, has started serving a 15-month jail sentence for contempt.\n\nHe was arrested for disobeying a Constitutional Court order to testify before a judicial panel probing the plunder of state coffers during his nine-year presidency.\n\nMost of the transgressions investigated by the commission involve three brothers from a wealthy Indian business family, the Guptas, who won lucrative government contracts and were allegedly allowed to choose cabinet ministers.\n\nZuma only testified once in July 2019.\n\nThe ANC forced Zuma \u2014 who is a member of the country\u2019s numerically dominant Zulu ethnic group \u2014 to resign in 2018 after mounting graft scandals.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The Director General of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Lukman, has asked the leaders of the All Progressives Congress must return to that 2013 mode and handle leadership negotiations for 2023 very carefully and skillfully.\n\nAPC which was birthed in 2013, weighed the prevailing political circumstances in which former President Goodluck Jonathan from the Southern part of the country was vying for the Presidency under the plaftorm of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and settled for Muhammadu Buhari from North.\n\nWhile APC\u2019s victory in 2015 could be attributed for zoning the Presidency to the North which was craving for the exalted office, the party is yet to make its position known in the face of agitation for power shift to the Southern part of the country ahead of 2023.\n\nBut Salihu in statement said, with the emergence of APC in 2013, the party\u2019s leaders were able to skillfully handle negotiations for leadership based on strategic consideration of winning the votes of Nigerians.\n\nThe Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), opined that APC should continue to work towards setting the right standards for Nigerian politics, which should prioritise national unity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe called for a campaign to review provisions of the APC manifesto to strengthen political initiatives for national unity in the process of re-organisation going on in the party.\n\nAccording to Salihu, part of the projection should be to get the next National Convention of the party adopt a new manifesto, which would highlight major commitments of the party for national unity to be use during the 2023 campaigns.\n\nHe said: \u201cIntegral to the campaign for national unity is the issue of how the party intend to handle negotiation for the emergence of the standard bearer for 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIn many respects, these are issues that should be handled internally within the structures of the party with all the confidence that principles of justice, equity and fairness can be achieved.\n\n\u201cInability of Nigerian politics to facilitate political negotiations and consensus building is responsible for the current difficulties facing all the geo-political zones of the country. The big question is whether the contest for leadership of the country in 2023 will prioritise processes of national consensus building through negotiations and agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWill political leaders from all the six geo-political regions commit themselves to implementing agreements that can strengthen the bonds of unity among citizens from the six geo-political regions? What could be the details of such agreements? And to what extent could the agreements meet the expectations of citizens from all the six geo-political regions\u201d, he queried.\n\nSalihu further asked that beyond which region produces the successor to President Buhari, what will be the commitment of the post-2023 Nigerian President to specific agenda of regional developments of both the region he/she come from and the other five regions?\n\nHe also said lack of unity was responsible for the present challenges facing Nigeria such as the insecurity in almost all parts of the country and secessionist agitations undermining the state machinery.\n\n\u201cNigeria is experiencing secessionist agitations from two groups from two sections of the country \u2013 Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s group in the South-East and Sunday Igboho\u2019s in the South-West. These are agitations, which have assumed the forms of civil disobedience and in the case of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s group in South-East, it has graduated to rebellion against the Nigerian state, resulting in attacks on police stations, kidnappings and killings of security personnel and other functionaries of government as well as destructions of government structures.\n\n\u201cWith the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East, which has dragged for over ten years now and the unfortunate loss of thousands of lives, destructions of both public and private properties, the recent secessionist agitations of Nnamdi Kano and Sunday Igboho require effective and efficient responses to maintain Nigeria as a united country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNoting also the rising incidences of banditry in the North-West and North-Central, producing more cases of kidnappings and abductions of law-abiding citizens, including schoolchildren, challenges of national survival is basically about strengthening the capacity of Nigerian security agencies to prevent and arrest criminal activities of rebellious groups in all parts of the country\u201d, Salihu added.",

          "text": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has joined post-riot clean-up efforts as his government warned against vigilantism and sought to avert racial conflict following days of unrest.\n\nThe country was gripped by more than a week of chaos in which more than 200 people were killed as looters ransacked shopping centres and rioters torched key industrial infrastructure and blocked trade routes.\n\nThe violence was the worst in post-apartheid South Africa and was sparked after former President Jacob Zuma was sentenced to 15 months in jail on July 8 for snubbing a corruption inquiry. The protests widened into grievances over longstanding poverty and inequality.\n\nHis trial for corruption in a separate case is due to resume on Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, Ramaphosa, who has faced criticism over the response to the violence, told a crowd outside a mall in the Soweto township: \u201cWe all admit there were lapses \u2026 we will gather ourselves and do a proper review.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople want to defend what we have in the form of democracy, our constitution and economy.\u201d\n\nHe also called for unity: \u201cWe must emerge after this much, much stronger and much more capable than we were before this incident happened.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa is under mounting pressure as only one of the suspected ringleaders of what officials have called an attempted \u201cinsurrection\u201d, which caused an estimated $1bn of damage, has been arrested.\n\nWhen asked if he would shake up his ministers responsible for security he said: \u201cWe are reviewing the situation, yes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from Johannesburg, Al Jazeera\u2019s Fahmida Miller said Ramaphosa has faced significant criticism over his comments about the riots last week.\n\n\u201cHe had said that it was ethnically-based and today he used his address to say that there was no link to ethnicity and the riots, and that notion was out the window,\u201d Miller said.\n\nShe went on to say that there was a lot of \u201cfinger-pointing\u201d between the military and the police.\n\n\u201cThere has been criticism that there wasn\u2019t enough intelligence passed on to police, in particular, to respond adequately to the riots,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cPolice have said they were overwhelmed and didn\u2019t have the capacity to deal adequately with what had happened.\u201d\n\nAccess to basic necessities like food has become a pressing issue in the areas affected by looting, arson and violence as many stores were destroyed while others remain closed.\n\nMany in the worst-hit KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province are now going hungry.\n\nAt a branch of the Grace family church in Durban, trestle tables were piled high with donated fresh vegetables and bread to prepare food parcels for those in need of food.\n\nMeanwhile, Police Minister Bheki Cele has warned against \u201cvigilante acts\u201d after residents of Phoenix outside Durban, a township of mostly Indian-origin South Africans, were accused of victimising their Black counterparts.\n\n\u201cIf we hear that people are being racially profiled at roadblocks set up in the area \u2026 [people] including police, are being intimidated, violated and in extreme cases people are being beaten up, and their cars are searched and torched [this] is simply criminal and won\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d he said in a statement late on Saturday.\n\nA task force of 10 detectives would be deployed to the area to investigate the deaths of 20 people during the mayhem, he added.\n\nOf the 212 people reported killed nationwide, some were shot and others died in looting stampedes.\n\nAlongside the human and economic toll, officials closed several beaches around Durban warning of possible contamination after a chemical spill at a factory set ablaze during the mayhem.\n\nOn Sunday, Ramaphosa visited malls in Soweto township, the most populous part of Gauteng province \u2013 the country\u2019s economic powerhouse \u2013 which also saw rioting and looting, to support business owners with clean-up efforts.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the [governing] African National Congress (ANC) will assess the damage caused by the recent looting and vandalism and to engage communities and various stakeholders in the rebuilding and reconstruction programme,\u201d the party said in a statement.\n\nSunday marks Mandela Day, in honour of democratic South Africa\u2019s first President Nelson Mandela, and would be a day of jubilation for the ANC under normal circumstances.\n\nPope Francis prayed for South Africa on Sunday, saying that violence had rocked the country \u201calready hit by health and economic challenges because of the pandemic\u201d.\n\nMany in the industry, particularly tourism which accounts for 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), worry that the violence will damage South Africa\u2019s reputation and set back economic progress.\n\nThe AFP news agency reported that traffic was back to normal on Sunday along a main highway linking the country\u2019s north to the Port of Durban which had been closed for days.\n\n\u201cIn as much as we are over the hurdle now, we are still scared,\u201d Zanele Khomo of the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe world is looking at us with those (negative) eyes, but we want to tell them that South Africa has a lot of good people and we have a lot of good stories to tell,\u201d said Siyanda Nxumalo, a head teacher in Durban, who helped to clear up the Dube Village Mall outside Durban following the unrest.",

Adults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries \u2013 with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus.\n\nScotland is easing restrictions so that pubs and restaurants can open until midnight \u2013 but limits on outdoor meetings will remain, the return of workers to offices will be delayed and face coverings will still be mandatory.\n\nRestrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July.\n\nMr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are self-isolating after contact with the health secretary, who announced on Saturday that he had tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nNo 10 initially said they would not have to isolate, as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing instead \u2013 sparking a backlash from opposition parties and businesses affected by staff quarantining.\n\nThe UK recorded a further 48,161 cases and 25 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Sunday. On both Friday and Saturday daily cases exceeded 50,000 \u2013 the first time this level has been reached since mid-January.\n\nAlmost 88% of adults in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 68.3% are double jabbed, according to the government\u2019s coronavirus dashboard.\n\nA decision on routinely offering Covid jabs to under-18s is expected within days.\n\nHowever, the scientist whose modelling led to the first nationwide restrictions has expressed concern that the UK could see as many as 200,000 cases and 2,000 hospital admissions a day.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Prof Neil Ferguson suggested a peak could occur between August and mid-September.\n\nMore than half a million alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the first week of July, with supermarkets saying they may have to cut opening hours or shut shops due to a lack of staff.\n\nAbsences from school have also surged, with 840,000 pupils self-isolating last week, with a further 630,000 absent for other reasons.\n\nPeople who are \u201cpinged\u201d by the app are advised to self-isolate for 10 days, but those contacted by NHS Test and Trace in England via text, email or phone can be fined if they do not self-isolate.\n\nSome fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in England will be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages.\n\nFrom 16 August, people who have had both their jabs in England will no longer have to self-isolate after close contact with someone who tests positive, but anyone who tests positive or develops symptoms will still need to do so.\n\nShadow health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said the government was being \u201creckless\u201d with Monday\u2019s easing of rules, adding: \u201cWe are saying keep masks, keep working from home\u2026 We are in favour of the economy reopening but we would put in place a series of precautions to try and slow the growth\u201d.\n\nLib Dem MP Layla Moran, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the government was \u201cadding fuel to the fire\u201d by easing so many restrictions when the virus was \u201csurging\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are already seeing businesses disrupted and hospitals filling up, showing that pitting lives against livelihoods was always a false choice,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "The largest wildfire in the US torched more dry forest landscape in Oregon on Sunday, one of dozens of major blazes burning across the West as critically dangerous fire weather loomed in the coming days.\n\nThe destructive Bootleg Fire just north of the California border grew to more than 476 square miles (1,210 square kilometers), an area about the size of Los Angeles.\n\nErratic winds fed the blaze, creating dangerous conditions for firefighters, said John Flannigan, an operations section chief on the 2,000-person force battling the flames.\n\n\u201cWeather is really against us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be dry and air is going to be unstable.\u201d\n\nAuthorities expanded evacuations that now affect some 2,000 residents of a largely rural area of lakes and wildlife refuges. The blaze, which was 22% contained, has burned at least 67 homes and 100 outbuildings while threatening thousands more.\n\nAt the other end of the state, a fire in the mountains of northeast Oregon grew to more than 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) by Sunday.\n\nThe Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, remote communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained.\n\nNatural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said.\n\nIn California, a growing wildfire south of Lake Tahoe jumped a highway, prompting more evacuation orders, the closure of the Pacific Crest Trail and the cancellation of an extreme bike ride through the Sierra Nevada.\n\nThe Tamarack Fire, which was sparked by lightning on July 4, had charred nearly 29 square miles (74 square kilometers) of dry brush and timber as of Sunday morning. The blaze was threatening Markleeville, a small town close to the California-Nevada state line. It has destroyed at least two structures, authorities said.\n\nA notice posted Saturday on the 103-mile (165-kilometer) Death Ride\u2019s website said several communities in the area had been evacuated and ordered all bike riders to clear the area. The fire left thousands of bikers and spectators stranded in the small town and racing to get out.\n\nKelli Pennington and her family were camping near the town Friday so her husband could participate in his ninth ride when they were told to leave. They had been watching smoke develop over the course of the day, but were caught off guard by the fire\u2019s quick spread.\n\n\u201cIt happened so fast,\u201d Pennington said. \u201cWe left our tents, hammock and some foods, but we got most of our things, shoved our two kids in the car and left.\u201d\n\nAbout 500 fire personnel were battling the flames Sunday, \u201cfocusing on preserving life and property with point protection of structures and putting in containment lines where possible,\u201d the U.S. Forest Service said.\n\nMeteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather with lightning possible through at least Monday in both California and southern Oregon.\n\n\u201cWith the very dry fuels, any thunderstorm has the potential to ignite new fire starts,\u201d the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California, said on Twitter.\n\nExtremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have swept the region, making wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.\n\nFirefighters said in July they were facing conditions more typical of late summer or fall.\n\nNorthern California\u2019s Dixie Fire roared to new life Sunday, prompting new evacuation orders in rural communities near the Feather River Canyon. The wildfire, near the 2018 site of the deadliest U.S. blaze in recent memory, was 15% contained and covered 39 square miles. The fire is northeast of the town of Paradise, California, and survivors of that horrific fire that killed 85 people watched warily as the new blaze burned.\n\nOfficials in Montana identified a firefighter who was seriously burned when flames overtook a crew fighting a small blaze there. Dan Steffensen was flown to a Salt Lake City hospital after the winds shifted suddenly on Friday, engulfing his fire engine near the Wyoming border. A second firefighter escaped without injury and called for help.\n\nThere were about 70 active large fires and complexes of multiple blazes that have burned nearly 1,659 square miles (4,297 square kilometers) in the U.S., the National Interagency Fire Center said. The U.S. Forest Service said at least 16 major fires were burning in the Pacific Northwest alone.\n\nAP",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has warned Nigerian researchers in the nation\u2019s ivory towers and other herbal medicine practitioners to desist from parading unverified medicinal products as suitable for curing Covid-19, without NAFDAC\u2019s approval.\n\nIt accused the University of Jos (UNIJOS) of trying to sell such unverified herbal products to its members of staff, warning that no herbal medicine has been approved for the treatment of Covid-19.\n\nThe agency also cautioned against the excessive consumption of onions and garlic, saying that both do not cure Covid-19.\n\nIn a statement Sunday in Abuja by NAFDAC\u2019s Resident Media Consultant, Sayo Akintola, the Director-General of the agency, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, said NAFDAC had submitted proposals for some herbal medicines to receive federal government\u2019s grants for clinical trials.\n\nShe said it was improper for anyone, whether a researcher in the university or a herbal medicine practitioner, to parade unverified herbal medicine which is yet to go through clinical trials as a remedy for Covid-19.\n\nShe added: \u201cThere is no single medicine that has been identified today to cure COVID -19. But there are herbal medicines that could alleviate symptoms of Covid-19.\n\n\u201cAs far as NAFDAC is concerned, we have not approved any medicine to treat Covid-19. We have approved medicines that they said can alleviate symptoms and relieve people of some symptoms of Covid-19.\n\n\u201cWhen the product is listed then clinical trial may start. I used \u2018may\u2019 because it\u2019s expensive; it takes a lot of money to do clinical trial.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the University of Jos has been given approval for its product, Silymarin, to commence clinical trial but that the process is yet to commence.\n\n\u201cUniversity of Jos said that there was a herbal medicine, whether its tea or whatever, that can cure COVID-19. They linked it with treatment of COVID -19. They did the packaging.\n\n\u201cWe did a letter to warn them that they cannot claim something unless it has gone through our listing process. They were trying to sell it to their staff. That is violation of our own regulatory policies. Nobody should say that this one can cure this or that without going through NAFDAC listing process,\u201d she stated.\n\nAccording to her, the research into herbal medicine by the academia is normal.\n\nShe, however, stated the academia should also recognise the national regulatory authority established to safeguard the safety of Nigerians by ensuring that the product that they are working on has to go through NAFDAC if they want to make it available for human consumption.\n\nAdeyeye warned that any attempt to market or distribute unapproved herbal medicine is a violation of the regulatory authority\u2019s regulation and protocols.\n\nWhile giving an insight into the reason why no locally-produced herbal medicine has yet been approved by the agency in the treatment of Covid-19 in Nigeria, Adeyeye said that no single herbal medicine had gone through full clinical trial.\n\nAccording to her, when NAFDAC approves medicines for listing, it means that it has been tested and is deemed safe to use.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC cannot say herbal medicine can treat Covid-19 until clinical trial is done. \u201cRight now, there is no single herbal medicine that has gone through full clinical trial the way clinical trial is supposed to be done.\n\n\u201cTo do official clinical trial, you must write a protocol, you must pass it through the National Health Research Ethical Committee (NHREC); you have to pass it through NAFDAC. We have not received any like that,\u201d she added.\n\nHowever, Adeyeye said the agency had approved some herbal medicines that the makers claimed could alleviate some of the symptoms of Covid-19, stressing that some of them are immune boosters that can increase the immune level of people.\n\nShe said many herbal products had been submitted for federal government\u2019s grants because most of the herbal practitioners lacked the required wherewithal to do clinical trial.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, many of these herbal products are being subjected to review by different agencies of government in the country. In terms of going through clinical trial official protocols, none has come through yet. That doesn\u2019t mean they will not because the process is still on,\u201d she said.\n\nThe NAFDAC DG explained that the agency will also do some physical testing, and some piezochemical testing on the products.\n\n\u201cWe will find out whether it has other components that may be used to alleviate some symptoms. We will also go to the manufacturing site to establish its level of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance. If it does, then we take samples\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nAdeyeye stated that listing means temporary approval for two years and renewable as a prelude to the clinical trial process.\n\nShe also warned Nigerians against excessive consumption of onions and garlic with a view to curing Covid\u201319.\n\nShe said: \u2018\u2019If you eat too much, your breath will be smelling and nobody will want to stay by you\u2019\u2019.\n\nShe stated that onions or garlic or any of the natural fruits that people take have antioxidant and nutrients that could help the users feel better.\n\n\u2018\u2019People might have been using it and they get better. But if it is not documented, it cannot be recognised by NAFDAC for Covid-19. They work on our cells to keep people healthier, but not to cure Covid-19. They help our body to function better. There is no cure for COVID-19 yet,\u2019\u2019 she added.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Presidency Chastises Sokoto Bishop Kukah, Accuses Him of Falsehood During Submission to US Congress",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s presidency on Sunday took issue with the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Kukah, over his submission to the United States Congress that nothing really works in Nigeria.\n\nIt described as unfortunate and disappointing the position of the \u201cso-called\u201d man of God painting his country in bad light before a foreign parliament.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, said in a statement that it was unfortunate, and disappointing for Nigerians to bear witness to one of their churchmen castigating their country in front of representatives of a foreign parliament.\n\nThe presidency stated that it is familiar with overseas political tours that opposition politicians take \u2013 visiting foreign leaders and legislators in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe, saying the argument goes that if they are heard seriously abroad, then Nigerian citizens back home should surely listen to them too.\n\nIt said: \u201cBut in order to be heard at all, and to maximise media coverage back home for their activities, inevitably these visits involve painting the worst possible picture of our country before their chosen foreign audience.\n\n\u201cSoon enough we inescapably hear an identical list of racist tropes against Northerners, how one religion dominates governance above all others, how the government is doing nothing to address herder-farmer disturbances, and how the government spends money on infrastructure to benefit everyone but the group and religion of the speaker.\n\n\u201cOf course, in order not to disappoint their western audience, regardless of fact, the list is always the same-and always slanted for whoever wishes to cross-check.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that Nigerians expected such position from the opposition, stressing that it is troubling when a \u201cso-called\u201d man of the church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\n\nThe presidency also explained steps taken so far by the present administration to tackle herder-farmer disturbances, saying \u201conly this government has put forward the first and singular plan in nearly a century to address herder-farmer challenges \u2013 a fact recognised by international NGOs, including the International Crisis Group\u201d.\n\nIt punctured Kukah\u2019s position that the Buhari-led government has done nothing in six years.\n\n\u201cTo declare to a foreign audience that this government does nothing is an incredible falsehood,\u201d the statement added.\n\nRather than the investment in infrastructure between Nigeria and Niger Republic being wasteful and biased as erroneously said by Kukah, the presidency said a similar infrastructure project between Lagos and Benin Republic had revolutionised the two neighbouring economies to the advantage of both countries.\n\nAccording to it, there is religious balancing in government appointments notwithstanding that the 1999 Constitution never stipulated ethnic or religious leaning in appointments into public office.\n\n\u201cThere is no bias in this government when the president is Northern and Muslim, the vice president Southern and Christian, and the cabinet equally balanced between the two religions. But neither is there anything in our constitution to state that political posts must be apportioned according to ethnicity or faith. It takes a warped frame of mind for a critic to believe ethnicity is of primary importance in public appointments. It is yet more troubling to hear a churchman isolating one group for criticism purely on ethnic lines,\u201d it added.\n\nThe presidency also faulted Kukah\u2019s position that only Christian schools were being attacked by bandits and terrorists, saying bandits and terrorists had in the past attacked both Christian and Muslim schools.\n\nIt said: \u201cWith due respect to the esteemed position he holds, the bishop\u2019s assertion that only Christian schools are being targeted by bandits or terrorists is not supported by the facts on the ground. It is sad to say but also true that victims of crime, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism cut across all strata of the society.\n\n\u201cSad but true that Kankara students in Katsina State were stolen by bandits of the same Islamic faith as those they took away. The same may be true of those who are still holding the 134 students of the Islamic School at Tegina in Niger State. The nation witnessed the sad incident of the female students abducted by bandits at Jangebe in Zamfara State and the over 100 predominantly Muslim students of the Federal Government Girls College, Birnin Yauri, in Kebbi State who are currently in captivity- and the nation\u2019s security agencies are hard at work to release them unharmed.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Christian students is sad and unacceptable; so also is the abduction of students of other faiths. The claim that only Christian schools are being targeted is totally untrue.\n\n\u201cAs a nation and a people, we must together define evil as evil. We must not allow our religious differences to divide us. No one gains but the evil doers when we divide our ranks, according to ethnicity and religion in confronting them. The bandit, kidnapper and terrorist are the enemies of the people who should be confronted in unison.\u201d\n\nThe statement also quoted copiously from the Bible to support its claim on ethnicity and racialism.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, the Bible is definitive on matters of ethnicity and racialism: In Romans 2:9-10, it says: \u2018There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honour and peace for everyone who does good\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd in Galatians 3:28: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u2019 Whether Christian or Muslim, we stand by these beliefs and are steadfastly committed to them in governance.\u201d\n\nThe presidency flayed the cleric for disparaging Nigeria before a foreign audience.\n\nIt said: \u201cThere is no place in mainstream civil discourse for those who actively, negatively, and publicly label an individual ethnic group, especially before a foreign audience.\n\n\u201cThese are not the views expressed or opinions held by the vast majority of the citizens of Nigeria. For all our challenges as a nation, nearly all of us seek to live together in harmony, celebrating differences, and finding common ground as Nigerians above all. But people like Kukah are doing their best to sow discord and strife among Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMore than any other set of people, leaders \u2013 in politics or religion who preach respect for truth have a duty to practise it. It is a moral and practical responsibility.\n\n\u201cGoing by the history of the church as is well known, it will stand up publicly for the truth.\n\nIt is time others did the same.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
