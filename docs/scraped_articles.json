          "text": "A professor of Computing and Information Technology, Adenike Osofisan, has said ten percent of the best universities in the world actively participate in collaborative multidisciplinary research.\n\nOsofisan who said this as keynote speaker at the 30th iSTEAMS conference organised by the Society for Multidisciplinary and Advance Research Techniques added that multidisciplinary collaborative research, rather than solo cut and paste table research, would address global challenges.\n\nThe three-day conference, which was titled, \u2018Educational legacies and pragmatic research innovation for addressing global challenges in a COVID-19 pandemic era,\u2019 was held at the Lagos State University of Science and Technology, Ikorodu, Lagos in partnership with Trinity University, Lagos.\n\nOsofisan whose keynote lecture was titled, \u2018New frontiers for institutional growth using collaborative and multidisciplinary research,\u2019 explained that the purpose of the research was to help understand the nature of human problems so as to effectively control the environment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In other words, this type of research pursues potential solutions to human and societal problems. This research is more prescriptive in nature, focusing on the how questions. How can we promote pragmatic research innovations that would address global challenges in a covid-19 pandemic era that is VUCA in Nigeria? The answer lies in engaging in Multidisciplinary Collaborative Research rather than in solo cut and paste table research.\n\n\u2018\u2018My sincere hope is that our deliberations at this conference would address issues that are germane to Collaborative Multidisciplinary and Pragmatic Research that will propel the growth of our institutions such that Nigeria institutions will be among the top universities in the world.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe added that the five ranking criteria for university were products of collaborative multidisciplinary research.\n\n\u2018\u2018All the universities mentioned in this keynote belong to the top 10% of best universities in the world because of their active participation in collaborative multidisciplinary research, The university performance ranking indicators are grouped into five areas; Teaching (the learning environment), Research (volume, income, and reputation), Citations (research influence); International outlook (staff, students and research) and Industry income (knowledge transfer). These five ranking criteria are products of collaborative multidisciplinary research. This new Era has led us into The New Normal known as VUCA\u2013Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity.\u2019\u2019\n\nRead Also\n\nWhile giving his welcome address, acting Vice-Chancellor, LASUSTECH, Dr. Oluremi Olaleye, said, \u2018\u2018I consider it an honour for our institution to host this year\u2019s iSTEAMS conference. The role of SMART Africa in promoting and contributing to the dissemination of national, indigenous African, diaspora, and international.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am excited and equally expectant to see robust papers being presented from all professional and academic angles. We must widen our horizons and think borderless in order to come up with workable solutions for our great continent and the world at large.\u2019\u2019\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday, dismissed a suit filed by the 36 states\u2019 Attorneys-General (AGs) and the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) challenging the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) from implementing its guidelines on local government spending.\n\nDelivering judgment, Justice Inyang Ekwo dismissed the suit for lacking in merit.\n\nJustice Ekwo held that upon studying the provisions of the NFIU\u2019s guidelines, he was unable to see where the provisions thereof contradict or conflict with the provision of Sections 7(1), (6) (a) and (b) of the constitution.\n\n\u201cI am also unable to see how the provisions of the 2nd defendant (NFIU)\u2019s guidelines contradict or conflict with the provisions of Section 162(6) of the constitution which creates the \u2018State Joint Local Government Account\u2019 into which allocations to the local government councils of the state from the Federation Account and from the government of the state shall be paid,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the guidelines did not contradict Section 162(8) of the constitution which prescribed that the amount standing to the credit of the local government council of the state shall be distributed among the local government councils of that state on such terms and in such manner as may be prescribed by the House of Assembly of the state.\n\nAccording to him, the provisions of the second defendant\u2019s guidelines do not contradict or conflict with the provisions of the Fourth Schedule to the 1999 Constitution which prescribes the functions of a local government council.\n\n\u201cThe duty of the court is limited to expounding the law and not expanding it.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, I see the provisions of the guidelines of the second defendant as seeking to direct the monitoring of accounts, transfers and any other means of payment or transfer of funds of local government councils as provided for in Section 3 (1) (r) of the Act of the NFIU.\n\n\u201cIt only limits cash withdrawal made from any local government account anywhere in the country to amount not exceeding N500,000.00 (Five Hundred Thousand Naira) per day.\n\n\u201cAny amount higher than that can be done using other methods of banking transaction save cash.\n\n\u201cUnless it can be shown that there is any provision of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which these provisions of the second defendant\u2019s guidelines have contradicted or conflicted directly and practically, then the issue of unconstitutionality cannot be said to arise,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge further said that he found that there was no provision of the NFIU\u2019s guidelines that has contravened the provisions of Sections 7(1), (6) (a) and (b), 162 (6), (7) and (8), and the 4th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cI also find that the case of the plaintiffs has not been established and I so hold,\u201d he ruled.\n\nJustice Ekwo, consequently, answered questions 1 to 5 formulated by the plaintiffs on the originating summons in the negative.\n\n\u201cI find in the end that the case of the plaintiffs lacks merit and ought to be dismissed and it is hereby dismissed. This is the order of this court,\u201d the judge declared.\n\nEarlier, the judge also struck out the name of the 37th plaintiff (Incorporated Trustees of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum) from the suit for lack of locus standi (legal right) to institute the suit.\n\nThe 36 states AGs and the 37 plaintiffs had sued the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), the NFIU and the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) to court as first to third defendants respectively.\n\nThey asked the court to determine that whether having regard to the combined effect of Sections 7 (1) (6) (a) and (b), 162 (6) and 162 (7) and (8) and the 4th Schedule of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) among others.\n\nThey said the Section guarantees the existence and structure of local government councils under local government laws of each state, the state governments of the federation are subject to the directives or control of the NFIU or anybody howsoever called, other than the House of Assembly of each state as to the manner and terms of the operation of State Joint Local Government Accounts in their respective states.\n\nThe plaintiffs had formulated five questions for determination.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that on May 6, 2019, NFIU had issued guidelines to stimulate the reduction of crime vulnerabilities created by cash withdrawals from local government funds across the country, beginning from June 1, 2019.\n\nThe guidelines, the agency said, included full enforcement of corresponding sanctions against violations.\n\nThe guidelines limited the cumulative amount that can be withdrawn from a local government account to not more than N500,000 daily.\n\nIt also directed that any other transaction must be done through valid cheques or electronic funds transfer, among others.\n\nIt said that cash withdrawal and transactions from State Joint Local Government Accounts (SJLGA) \u201cposed biggest corruption, money laundering and security threats at the grassroots and to entire financial system and the country\u201d.\n\nBut the state governments had dragged the AGF, the NFIU and NULGE to court arguing that such directive was in breach of financial autonomy as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.

          "text": "\n\n* Argues southwest angling for power makes no sense\n\n*Declares Nnamani, Onu are disadvantaged by age\n\n*Explains zoning is difficult after people had purchased forms\n\n*Says bandits attacked Kaduna train because they thought they were delegates coming to collect dollar in Abuja\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nWith just a few days to the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), presidential hopeful and former Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has described the trio of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and Senator Ibikunle Amosun \u2013 all contenders for the APC ticket \u2013 as unsuitable for Nigeria\u2019s current work plan.\n\n\n\nNwajiuba, however, described the three contenders to the office of president as nice people. But he insisted that it made no sense for anyone from the South-west to be pitching for the presidency of the country now, after former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s eight years in office and Osinbajo about to serve out another eight years as vice president.\n\n\n\nThe former minister spoke exclusively to THISDAY in a presidential series interview.\n\nHe said former President of the Senate, Senator Ken Nnamani, and former Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, were patriotic Nigerians with good intentions, but maintained they were disadvantaged by their ages, as they were above 60 years.\n\n\n\nOn the question of zoning, which some have called an albatross in the party, Nwajiuba explained that it became difficult the moment everyone was allowed to purchase nomination forms.\n\nHe suggested that the reason bandits recently attacked a Kaduna bound train might be because they thought most of the passengers were delegates heading to Abuja to share from a dollar rain by aspirants, who had monetised the nomination process.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Imo State-born lawyer, who resigned his ministerial post to contest for the presidency, \u201cYou may be a smart person in the 60s, but the knowledge of economy has moved beyond your era. You might have governed Lagos State before, but those people you trained are also doing fantastic.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat, then, did not make the knowledge resident in only you. You could have great leaders like Asiwaju Tinubu or men like Ibikunle Amosun, even the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, who by their nature are very nice persons, they might not be suitable for the work plan now.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are those, who mean well but being challenged by the age factor, like the former senate president, Ken Nnamani. He is a lovely person, who has the interest of Nigerians at heart, but he may not be as strong as he used to be when he was in government. So, you must excuse him.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same thing applies to Ogbonnaya Onu, who also has the challenge of age. They are good men. We also have younger elements, like the governor of Kogi State, who, very agile in his 40s, but he has not garnered a nationalistic experience yet. He must be given room to grow.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many constraints for different aspirants. We need somebody, who has the empathy, the energy, the enthusiasm, and exact understanding of the experiences and knowledge that are required.\u201d\n\nStill on zoning and why some of his former colleagues in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet opted out of the presidential race, Nwajiuba said, \u201cYes, maybe because they did not study the time frame very well. I don\u2019t know whether they had certain other interpretations around it. Some may not have enough funds to pay for the forms.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbout 3,816 people contributed the money, which I used to buy my own form and I\u2019ve published their names. People contributed between N5, 000 and N500, 000 each within two weeks across the country. So, if we are going to build a consensus around the 24 aspirants, we will then talk about the location.\n\n\n\n\u201cNobody had zoned the positions before people started purchasing the forms. So, you cannot zone after they had purchased the forms. It is from the people, who are now available that you will look at what each aspirant is bringing to the table and how best would they solve Nigeria\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\n\n\nNwajiuba, who defended the decision by some northerners to join the race, said, \u201cThere are three people from the north, who purchased the APC presidential forms: President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello; and Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Mohammed Badaru. They all have the right credentials to be Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are men of foresight. They are from the North-east, North-central, and North-west. They are possibly in the contest to make a statement that if we are talking about national justice and fairness, we should only be thinking of the South-east. This is because it is the only zone in the south that has not produced president since 1999.\n\n\u201cHowever, for them to be seeing about eight people from the South-west suddenly laying claims to the same argument they had against the north makes it look very silly. This is because you cannot be accusing the north of something you are also perpetrating.\n\n\n\n\u201cOlusegun Obasanjo had been president for eight years; Osinbajo has been vice president since 2015. Why should the South-west say the north should cede power to the south and that they must be the beneficiary? How does that make any sense of any type?\n\n\n\n\u201cYet they are asking the young patriots in the north to cede power to them. I am sure if the South-west pulls out of the presidential race, aspirants from the north would also rest their ambitions and allow the South-east to produce Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023.\u201d\n\n\n\nAddressing allegations that he had not been going round to meet with delegates, probably, because he was complacent that Buhari already had his back, Nwajiuba said, \u201cMy job is how to organise the country. We have five delegates from each ward, including the chairman and the secretary. One of the remaining three delegates must be a woman. We were already a factor in every polling unit before the election started. That is how we think in modern times.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you like buy two aircraft and be crisscrossing the country, once you leave your destination, other people will go and dine there. That is not how politics is done. We don\u2019t need to do dollar bazar on the day of the presidential convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the bandits to come and attack us, like they did the last time, when they attacked the train going to Kaduna, because the bandits thought they were delegates, who had come to Abuja to collect dollars. If we insist on bringing everybody here and cause a naira rain in Abuja, how will the poor people survive?\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Former banker and presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-deen, says he is in the race to change the character and complexion of Nigerian politics. Hayatu-deen said he was not a career politician, but only out to save the country from collapse, if elected president.\n\n\n\nHe made the assertions yesterday in Lagos during an interactive session with media executives.\n\nHayatu-deen said as an economist he knew what was needed to kick-start the economy and ensure Nigerians smiled again.\n\n\n\nHe regretted the current killings in the country, saying it started in a part of Borno State, but has now enveloped the whole North.\n\n\n\nThe aspirant added that bandits and ISWAP insurgents controlled areas about 40 kilometres outside major cities in the north. He lamented that Nigerians were only safer in the cities but in the villages, poor and vulnerable citizens, mainly children and women, were being killed.\n\n\n\nHayatu-deen said in the 80s and 90s, Nigerians used to shed tears whenever they heard that limbs were being cut in countries like Sierra Leone or when they heard about the genocide in Rwanda.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut today, we heard deaths in 50s and 60s, which is quite mind-boggling,\u201d he stated. \u201cThis is unacceptable and we have to deal with this.\u201d\n\n\n\nHayatu-deen added, \u201cAnd I can tell you that even if you increase the strength of the military by three, you will only be scratching the surface. We must not mistake the symptoms for the cause and that is why we have to look at the issue holistically and solve it once and for all.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to successfully deal with insecurity, it would must create \u201ceconomic, social as well as gender security\u201d.\n\n\n\nHayatu-deen said, \u201cWe are a country of 210 million people and from global statistics, Nigeria is one of the highest growing countries in the world if not the highest growing.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said there was nothing wrong with this if the country had the wherewithal to cater for the soaring population.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHigh population on its own is not bad as long as the country is ready to cater for the growing population. But the problem here is that we do not have any provision for these young Nigerians. As at now, we have over 170 million young Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said there was a connection between insecurity and the growing army of able-bodied young men and women who were not adequately catered for.\n\n\n\nHayatu-deen also spoke on the question of gender security, saying, \u201cOur women are hardworking and doing a lot of things, both for the society and the family. We need to encourage them and ensure they reach their peak. That glass ceiling has to be broken and allow them to reach the top.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his chances as an aspirant for the PDP presidential ticket, Hayatu-deen jokingly said he knew he was the rookie among the many career politicians jostling for the ticket. But he added that he drew inspiration from the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron, who, as investment banker, took the French political space by storm and won the presidency at less than 40 years of age.\n\n\n\nThe former managing director and chief executive officer of FSB International Bank believed a non-career politician could challenge the status quo and win. He said he was confident of victory in the race and equally sure of PDP\u2019s victory.\n\n\n\nHe then challenged the media to play its role and ensure that the best candidates emerged in both parties.\n\nHayatu-deen stated, \u201cThe media has a lot of role to play in sensitising delegates in both parties to ensure they pick the right candidates. You have to do this for us and ensure that Nigeria is rescued.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said he would not accept any appointment even if his party won the election next year.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to help my nation. No one would accuse me of being a bystander and didn\u2019t join in trying to salvage the nation when it was burning. My father admonished me to see Nigeria as the centre of my universe and that is what it has been. I really love this nation,\u201d Hayatu-deen declared.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Crisis Rocks Ruling APC As Tinubu Secretly Obtains Lagos Senatorial Form For Ex-Deputy Governor After Conclusion Of Screening",
          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State has been enmeshed in a crisis after its national leader and former governor of the state, Bola Tinubu, and other stalwarts secretly obtained Lagos West senatorial nomination form for Mrs Idiat Oluranti Adebule, a former deputy governor of the state.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the form was obtained for Adebule after all senatorial aspirants had been screened.\n\nDocuments obtained by SaharaReporters also show that the former deputy governor wasn\u2019t among the aspirants who bought and submitted nominations forms.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters on Monday, a source said Adebule had been moving from one ward to another to canvas for the votes of delegates despite not being on the list of those screened to contest the primary.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Idiat Oluranti Adebule has joined the race to represent Lagos West Senatorial District in the Senate in the forthcoming general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you earlier published, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu had made several moves through the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to obtain a nomination form for her, after the closure of sale of form and screening of aspirants.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur people at the National Secretariat of the APC revealed that only three aspirants namely; Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, Mr. Kayode Opeifa and Mrs. Joke Orelope-Adefulire obtained nomination forms from Lagos West.Whereas both Obanikoro and Opeifa submitted their forms and were thereafter cleared by the screening committee, Orelope-Adefulire neither submitted the form nor presented herself for the race. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Governor Tinubu Plots To Secretly Obtain Ruling APC Senatorial Form For \u2018Stooge\u2019 In Lagos Despite Conclusion Of Screening\n\n\u201cThere was never a time before and during the processes of submission of forms or screening that the name Adebule came up, having not obtained the expression of interest and nomination forms in the first place,\u201d the source said.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier exposed how Tinubu and other leaders of the party were fraudulently planning to obtain the senatorial nomination forms for one of their stooges after their preferred candidate, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, withdrew from the race.\n\n\n\nOrelope-Adefulire had stepped down her senatorial ambition to retain her current appointment as the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nSaharaReporters on Monday learnt the form had been obtained through the backdoor for Adebule and she had already started campaigning for votes from delegates.\n\n\u201cNot pleased with the inability of their preferred candidate- Adejoke Orolope-Adefulire to contest the Lagos West Senatorial race, the Lagos APC leader has embarked on illegal means of obtaining a new form for a new aspirant,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know that the trio of Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire and Kayode Opeifa had obtained the forms to contest for the seat in the red chamber but only Obanikoro and Opeifa attended the screening exercise while Orelope stepped down her ambition to retain her current appointment.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, not satisfied with the chances of the remaining aspirants at the primary, the National Leader in collusion with the National Chairman of the APC is on the verge of obtaining a form through the backdoor. However, how a man like Adamu Abdullahi with his pedigree will allow such illegality to be perpetrated under his watch, is left to be seen.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is believed that the new form (if successfully obtained) will be for either of these three persons. Top on the list is his sister-in-law; Dr. (Mrs) Lola Akande, a commissioner in the cabinet of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat or the former Deputy Governor, Mrs. Idiat Adebule.\n\n\n\n\u201cTinubu is attempting to leverage the perceived relationship formed between Idiat Adebule who was a member of the APC reconciliation committee headed by Adamu Abdullahi, to have his way.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Monday, the source further noted that \u201cit is therefore obvious that the aspiration of Idiat Adebule will suffer a huge loss, especially if the party goes ahead to present her as its candidate after its primaries, once it is tested in a competent court of jurisdiction\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is fatal to the party. Adebule is challenged to publish the teller or e-receipt of the transfer of the expression of interest and nomination forms fee she paid to the party as well as the receipts issued to her by the national secretariat as done for other aspirants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact, therefore, that Dr. Adebule\u2019s form was obtained illegally and anything built on illegality is bound to fail. How then can a non-aspirant become a candidate? What is more worrisome for members of the party in the Senatorial District and by extension Lagos State is that it appears their party has not learned from past experiences where it lost to the opposition party, even in some cases, having won in the general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe case of Zamfara State comes to mind, in this instant - indeed, this is even worse-off.

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State has been enmeshed in a crisis after its national leader and former governor of the state, Bola Tinubu, and other stalwarts secretly obtained Lagos West senatorial nomination form for Mrs Idiat Oluranti Adebule, a former deputy governor of the state.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the form was obtained for Adebule after all senatorial aspirants had been screened.\n\nDocuments obtained by SaharaReporters also show that the former deputy governor wasn\u2019t among the aspirants who bought and submitted nominations forms.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters on Monday, a source said Adebule had been moving from one ward to another to canvas for the votes of delegates despite not being on the list of those screened to contest the primary.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Idiat Oluranti Adebule has joined the race to represent Lagos West Senatorial District in the Senate in the forthcoming general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you earlier published, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu had made several moves through the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to obtain a nomination form for her, after the closure of sale of form and screening of aspirants.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur people at the National Secretariat of the APC revealed that only three aspirants namely; Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, Mr. Kayode Opeifa and Mrs. Joke Orelope-Adefulire obtained nomination forms from Lagos West.Whereas both Obanikoro and Opeifa submitted their forms and were thereafter cleared by the screening committee, Orelope-Adefulire neither submitted the form nor presented herself for the race. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Governor Tinubu Plots To Secretly Obtain Ruling APC Senatorial Form For \u2018Stooge\u2019 In Lagos Despite Conclusion Of Screening\n\n\u201cThere was never a time before and during the processes of submission of forms or screening that the name Adebule came up, having not obtained the expression of interest and nomination forms in the first place,\u201d the source said.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier exposed how Tinubu and other leaders of the party were fraudulently planning to obtain the senatorial nomination forms for one of their stooges after their preferred candidate, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, withdrew from the race.\n\n\n\nOrelope-Adefulire had stepped down her senatorial ambition to retain her current appointment as the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nSaharaReporters on Monday learnt the form had been obtained through the backdoor for Adebule and she had already started campaigning for votes from delegates.\n\n\u201cNot pleased with the inability of their preferred candidate- Adejoke Orolope-Adefulire to contest the Lagos West Senatorial race, the Lagos APC leader has embarked on illegal means of obtaining a new form for a new aspirant,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know that the trio of Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire and Kayode Opeifa had obtained the forms to contest for the seat in the red chamber but only Obanikoro and Opeifa attended the screening exercise while Orelope stepped down her ambition to retain her current appointment.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, not satisfied with the chances of the remaining aspirants at the primary, the National Leader in collusion with the National Chairman of the APC is on the verge of obtaining a form through the backdoor. However, how a man like Adamu Abdullahi with his pedigree will allow such illegality to be perpetrated under his watch, is left to be seen.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is believed that the new form (if successfully obtained) will be for either of these three persons. Top on the list is his sister-in-law; Dr. (Mrs) Lola Akande, a commissioner in the cabinet of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat or the former Deputy Governor, Mrs. Idiat Adebule.\n\n\n\n\u201cTinubu is attempting to leverage the perceived relationship formed between Idiat Adebule who was a member of the APC reconciliation committee headed by Adamu Abdullahi, to have his way.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Monday, the source further noted that \u201cit is therefore obvious that the aspiration of Idiat Adebule will suffer a huge loss, especially if the party goes ahead to present her as its candidate after its primaries, once it is tested in a competent court of jurisdiction\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is fatal to the party. Adebule is challenged to publish the teller or e-receipt of the transfer of the expression of interest and nomination forms fee she paid to the party as well as the receipts issued to her by the national secretariat as done for other aspirants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact, therefore, that Dr. Adebule\u2019s form was obtained illegally and anything built on illegality is bound to fail. How then can a non-aspirant become a candidate? What is more worrisome for members of the party in the Senatorial District and by extension Lagos State is that it appears their party has not learned from past experiences where it lost to the opposition party, even in some cases, having won in the general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe case of Zamfara State comes to mind, in this instant - indeed, this is even worse-off. The party, at the national, state and local government levels does not need to be enmeshed in any illegality in the course of its primaries, considering the anticipated challenges it will face in the general elections, since its popularity among the Nigerian electorate has further dwindled in recent times.\n\n\n\n\u201cTinubu and Adebule may have their way on this, but the national secretariat should be wise enough to stamp its feet on the ground and do things in accordance with its own constitution, failure of which will lead to another seat already lost for it in the red chamber even before the conduct of the election. This is glaring illegality which must be condemned in its entirety,\u201d the source added.",

I will be disappointed but notwithstanding, we will still show party loyalty,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking about the deadline for the conduct of primaries, the former senate president said the time stipulated by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is too short.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn the side of the umpire, I think something is not adding up. The primaries require more time than the campaign period.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has created a new tax on phone calls in the bid to fund free healthcare for Nigerian citizens who cannot afford healthcare\u2014the vulnerable group. The law defines the \u201cvulnerable group\u201d in society as \u201cChildren under five, pregnant women, aged, physically and mentally challenged persons, and indigent people as may be defined from time to time\u201d.\n\nThis new law is stated in the new National Health Insurance Authority Bill 2021, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari last week.\n\nThe provisions of Section 26 sub-section 1c of the Act states that the source of money for the Vulnerable Group Fund includes \u201ctelecommunications tax, not less than one kobo per second of GSM calls.\u201d\n\nOther sources of income for the Vulnerable Group Fund include the Basic Health Care Provision Fund, health insurance levies, grants, donations, gifts, and any other voluntary contributions. The law also requires that all persons resident in Nigeria are expected to obtain health insurance.\n\nWith average call rates of 11 Kobo per second, this new act implies that there will be a tax of at least 9% on every second of all phone calls made in Nigeria.\n\nNigerians made 150.83 billion minutes of calls in 2020 according to a report by the Nigerian Communications Commission. This translates to 9.05 trillion seconds of calls, meaning the new tax will generate at least 9.05 trillion Kobo, which converts to \u20a690.49 billion ($18.09 million), annually.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when this new tax will take effect and how much it\u2019ll be but it hints that there\u2019ll be an increase in call-tariffs in Nigeria, as it\u2019s unlikely that the telecom companies will absorb the cost.\n\nLast month, telecom companies under the umbrella of the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria proposed a 40% increase in the cost of calls, SMS, and data as a result of the rising cost of operating in the country. This new tax creates a more compelling case for the telcos to hike their prices.\n\nShare this article",

After an editorial review of the teams registered for the Hackathon, six teams made it through and pitched their solutions to our judges virtually on Friday, May 13, 2022.\n\nThe teams were chosen based on the originality and uniqueness of their proposed solutions for the Hackathon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor their first pitch, they got on a call with the judges: Mayowa Tudonu, Blockchain Engineer at Shard Labs; Sultan Akintunde, Co-founder at TalenQL and AltSchool Africa; and Clement Hugbo, Crevatal Co-founder.\n\nThe TABS Web3 Hackathon, sponsored by @NairaEx, began virtually on May 9, 2022, with six teams.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonjour,\n\nIt\u2019s another week, but this one smells like salary week. \ud83d\ude0d Ah, I love this week already, don\u2019t you? Are you grinning or smiling? I\u2019m writing this with a sheepish grin because money makes me happy. \ud83d\ude01\n\nThis week, especially on payday, I\u2019ll laugh the entire day. Would you go out for lunch or dinner, or take a day out to enjoy yourself? I believe it is healthy for you to do that; health is wealth, after all.\n\nBy the way, I hope you\u2019re not anticipating the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS) gist from last Saturday. \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are, I\u2019m sorry (not really) to disappoint you, ladies and gentlemen. There is no gist because there are no words to describe the summit. You had to be there! It was an experience in and of itself.\n\nI\u2019m just joking, though. Bolu should have a rundown of all that went down.\n\nIf you were there or watched online, please tell me about what you did and saw. Did you meet new people? If you missed it or want to rewatch it, kindly click this link.\n\nSo, today I\u2019ll talk about two interesting stories from the previous week:\n\nYC\u2019s warning to startup founders\n\nCBN proposed open bank data\n\nYC warns startup founders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US may be headed for a recession in 2023 or later this year, 2022, as Gross Domestic Profit (GDP) fell in the previous two quarters. In addition, due to high inflation, the country\u2019s interest rates are rising.\n\nConsequently, to weather the coming recession, Y Combinator (YC) has advised its founders to cut costs and plan for the worst. Why? As the economy slows, funding is likely to reduce.\n\nYou should be familiar with YC by this point. \ud83d\ude09 The firm, which is one of the largest in the world, has invested in over 3,000 startups, with 51 from Nigeria and over 13 coming from other African countries.\n\nI won\u2019t go into much detail, but if you want to learn more about how YC is changing the African startup game, you can download the report here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the US, companies appear to be laying off employees. And while some private companies are tightening up their boots, some venture capitalists are withholding checks.\n\nConcerning the latter, recall that SoftBank announced that it would become much more selective in its investments following a $27.7 billion loss on investments in its Vision Fund for its just-ended fiscal year.\n\nAlso, firms like Tiger Global and D1 Capital are reportedly reducing late-stage investments.\n\nBesides, in the letter, YC said, \u201cIf your plan is to raise money in the next 6-12 months, you might be raising at the peak of the downturn\u2026\u201d\n\nRemember that funding news slowed in April 2022. Apparently, it wasn\u2019t an African thing; it was a global problem. For context, listen to this: Why funding news slowed down in April.\n\nSo African companies, particularly those that spend their capital quickly or do not generate enough profit, will struggle.\n\nFor example, startups that previously raised a round in 2020 or 2021 could find it challenging to raise subsequent rounds at a higher valuation because raising funds at a lower valuation may imply the company\u2019s weakness, undermining the confidence of any existing investors in the business.\n\nBesides that, because venture capitalists prefer to keep their money in portfolio companies, they will be less likely to make new investments. This implies that startups may have to rely on customers for revenue.\n\nIf you ask me, that\u2019s not a bad thing. But nobody asked me. For context, please listen here.\n\nCBN wants banks to share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Businesstimes.ng\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has proposed the regulatory framework for open banking in the country.\n\nWhy? They want to encourage innovation and broaden the range of financial products and services available to bank customers and improve data sharing across banking and payment systems.\n\nThis proposal comes a year after the CBN first indicated plans to formalise open banking by defining four types of data that can be exchanged. It is doubly interesting that rumblings on the matter had already begun as far back as 2018, as you can see in this story on Open Banking Nigeria.\n\nSo, what comes to mind when you hear open banking? An open bank? \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 I didn\u2019t say so, though.\n\nWhat is it then? Open banking, also known as \u201copen bank data,\u201d is a system that allows third-party applications \u2014 startups and online financial service vendors \u2014 to access and control consumer banking and financial accounts. This breaks banks\u2019 monopoly on the use of customer data.\n\nHow does it work? Because open banking relies on networks rather than centralisation, customers are typically required to provide consent to allow the bank to grant such access.\n\nThen, APIs from third-party providers can access the customer\u2019s shared data (and data about the customer\u2019s financial counterparties).\n\nMeanwhile, the CBN stated that \u201cparticipants in open banking shall adhere strictly to security standards when accessing and storing data, and shall be subject to minimum privacy standards, operational standards, risk management standards, and customer experience standards as prescribed by the Bank.\u201d\n\nOpen banking carries as many risks as it does potential rewards. This includes serious threats to financial privacy and the security of consumers\u2019 finance and resulting liabilities for financial institutions.\n\nWant to know how open banking can improve financial inclusion?

It\u2019s not just about consuming my content and knowing how I\u2019m faring.\n\nPlease keep me updated on how you\u2019re doing, too. Also, engage my newsletter by leaving your thoughts and encouraging others to subscribe. Promise to do it? Pinky swear?

Well, honestly, it\u2019s been a stressful week for the Techpoint Africa team. But, you know what? It\u2019s over already. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve registered, you\u2019ll see all the fantastic things we\u2019ve packaged just for you tomorrow. However, all tickets, including giveaways, are sold out.\n\nSo, prepare your NFT and web3 questions. You also don\u2019t want to miss the exhibition booth, networking, and the hackathon\u2019s grand finale. You\u2019re excited too, aren\u2019t you? \ud83d\ude09 I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\n\nIf you do not have a ticket to the physical event, you can register online for free here.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\nNetflix\u2019s Mystery Box\n\nTikTok\u2019s plan to credit creators\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory Farms, a Kenyan-based startup, has raised $5 million in new funding.\n\nEd Brakeman, a senior managing director at Bain Capital and Hans den Bieman, Founder and ex-CEO of Mowi, a company that claims to be one of the world\u2019s largest salmon businesses, led the investment.\n\nLaunched in 2015 by Joseph Rehmann (CEO), Victory Farms is a tilapia aquaculture startup and farm with hatcheries, nursery ponds, and deep-water cages.\n\nThe company claims to have grown twice as fast as any other African fish company. Also, the CEO says they have sold to mass market Africans through a highly innovative Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) cold chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Rehmann, the RTM cold chain uses predictive data to push fish to thousands of marketers every day across Kenya with less than 1% spoilage.\n\nCurrently, Victory Farms has more than 54 retail locations where over 15,000 market women go to buy fish, and according to Rehmann, they use no electricity or ice.\n\nThis funding will enable the company to expand into Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.\n\nNetflix for kids and people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix has launched \u201cMystery Box\u201d, a new feature that helps kids discover new movies and TV shows.\n\nWhy? Netflix wants children to try new movies. According to Netflix, children frequently rewatch their favourite shows, making it difficult to persuade them to try something new.\n\nAlso, the company says Mystery Box will provide kids with a personalised experience that will assist them in discovering their next favourite series or movies, and reconnect them with a familiar character.\n\nThis is now available on the company\u2019s connected TV platforms globally.\n\nNetflix is also expanding its accessibility features globally and launching a new collection featuring stories about people with disabilities in honour of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which was observed yesterday, May 19, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the company is expanding its subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) and audio descriptions (AD) offerings in additional languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\nWhy? Heather Dowdy, Netflix\u2019s Director of Accessibility, stated that they are adding more subtitles because more subscribers are watching disability-inclusive content globally.\n\nMoreover, remember that Netflix reported a 200,000-subscriber loss globally in the first quarter of 2022. Perhaps, this could be a strategy for Netflix to retain and gain more subscribers.\n\nTikTok to credit creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never used TikTok, but I\u2019m considering signing up. You\u2019re asking me why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\nJust this month, the company introduced two new features \u2014 Pulse and Branded Mission \u2014 for content creators to earn money on the app.\n\nDespite its popularity, TikTok has been criticised for amplifying trends without crediting the original creators. TikTok launched a new feature to that effect two days ago, May 18, 2022.\n\nThis feature, a button, allows creators to credit all types of inspiration for their content, like dances, jokes, and viral sounds. By tapping on \u201ccredit\u201d in the video\u2019s caption, TikTok viewers can discover the original creators behind the content.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nReport: The impact of Y Combinator in Africa over the years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

I am athletics coach in Edo. I am a former state and national champions as I represented then Bendel State in various Athletics Championship even when the old Bendel State was shared into two states: Edo and Delta, I ran for Edo state in several championship as well.\n\nINTERNATION SCENE:\n\nI became the National Champion in 2003 in 21KM Race. In fact, I set the record in Goteberg in Sweden. From there, I moved to the mountain in Cameroon, the Boya City Mountain and I won a trophy there same 2003.\n\nCOACHING CAREER:\n\nAfter my exploit at Boya City mountain, I was issued a letter by the state as a grassroots coach in athletics.

I am not just competing alone, but I am competing to win and I have done it before. I have started training ahead of the race for a long time.\n\nCHAMPION OF 1ST OKPEKPE MARATHON:\n\nIn the first ever Okpekpe race, i was the overall winner of the marathon race. Then, international athletes were not invited to complete. I won the overall prize then. At the 2nd edition of Okpekpe 10Km race, the Organizers fixed us into the indigenous category where I also became the champion of this new category.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RACE:\n\nAfter the second edition of the Okpekpe Marathon race, I started producing athletes for the championship and at the last championship held in 2019, I went with an 8-year -old girl , this development was first in the world. I took 10 athletes for the championship which the Deputy Governor of the state was the Captain of Edo state Team.

In Distance Race, we have 24 Golds for grab raging from 800M,1500, 3000M, 5000M and 10, 000M respectively. Its two golds each for male and female categories making it 24 golds in total.\n\nWAY FORWARD FOR ATHLETES DISCOVERY:\n\nFor we to get it right, Edo must keep harnessing talents from grassroots rather than thinking of buying as talents abound in the state. In fact, I was discovered at Baptist High School, TV Road, Benin City and I was produce here in Edo. I believe in catching them young and this is what I am doing daily.\n\nON CHAIRMAN OF EDO SPORTS COMMISSION\n\nMr. YUSUF ALI, I know him very well. He was my senior in the Track. No doubt, Mr Yusuf is capable of transforming Sports in Edo state. He has the ability and Capacity to do so and we are all happy to have him as the sports commission Chairman.\n\nADVISE:\n\nI want too advise sports men and women in the state to always exploit their God\u2019s given potentials, gifts, talents as my athletic prowess is a gift from God because I came from an average home.\n\nI want to specially thank my bossom friend, Mr Osawaru Ogbeide-Ihama, who has decided to sponsor me and my athletes to this year\u2019s Okpekpe 10K Race.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLast week, our organisation organized a 2-day seminar for CSOs and journalists on enhancing advocacy skills on anti-corruption and social inclusive reform issues in Nigeria. It was tagged Enhancing Anti-corruption and Social Inclusive Reform Initiatives in Nigeria. It is designed to enhance local civil society organizations\u2019 ability to be positive and responsible change agents in Nigeria.\n\nThe Enhancing Anti-corruption and Social Inclusive Reform Initiatives in Nigeria project is designed following the anchor cluster model adopted by Palladium to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms. This project works with us as \u2018anchor\u2019 organisation working with 8 cluster member organizations spread across six states and the Federal Capital Territory. The States are Abia, Edo, Delta, Imo, Ondo, Rivers and the FCT, Abuja. ANEEJ is working with the eight cluster members located in these states including the FCT to implement and deliver this project.\n\nThe cluster organisations are: 21st Century Community Empowerment for youth and Women Initiative, Abuja; Community Empowerment and Development Initiative (CEDI), Warri, Delta State; Community Heritage Watch for Development Initiative, (KAI) Akure, Ondo State; Christian Fellowship and Care Foundation (CFCF), Owerri, Imo State; Foundation for Environmental Rights, Advocacy and Development (FENRAD), Aba, Abia State; Gender and Development Action (GADA) Port-Harcourt, Rivers State; Joint Association of Persons with Disability (JONAPWD) Edo State Chapter; and New Apostolic Church Centre for Development (NCD), Benin City, Edo State.\n\nWe consider this project as an important one that seeks to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms at both the national and sub-national levels with an ultimate goal of strengthening governance to deliver development goals to citizens, particularly in addressing poverty and inequality amongst our people.\n\nIt will interest you to know that aside the anti-corruption component, the project is also designed to address reforms as well as issues of transparency and accountability in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and six oil and gas producing states \u2013 Abia, Delta, Edo, Imo, Rivers and Ondo. This explains why participation and cluster members were drawn from these states.\n\nDuring the course of implementing this project, interventions will include advocacy for passage/adoption of pending Anti-Corruption Bills, the National Anti-corruption Strategy (NACS II) and the NDDC Act Amendment Bill currently before the national assembly. The project will also support oversight and implementation of the Nigeria\u2019s International anti-corruption/asset recovery commitments; Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commissions among others. Our cluster currently advocates for the mainstreaming of anti-corruption issues into the country upcoming 2023 general elections discourse. Some of which are already ongoing as CSOs jointly called on political aspirants to mainstream issues of anti-corruption in the upcoming general elections during the learning event held in Benin City in April. If you watched Good morning show on NTA last Tuesday, I spoke extensively about addressing corruption issues during elections, we must move away from the culture and norms that promote corruption and create incentive for those who are not willing to buy votes, induce voters and rig elections.\n\nAs you know, the Proceeds of Crime Bill (POCA) has just been signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari which gives a working instrument for the anti-corruption agencies like the EFCC, ICPC and CCB to work collaboratively and solve corruption problems in Nigeria. Since POCA has been passed and accented to, there are others on the queue such as the Whistleblower Protection Bill and the Witness Protection Bill. We should work together to see how our collective effort can result in the passage of these bills and others.\n\nThe two-day workshop is specifically designed for CSOs and journalists from the project benefiting States. We want to see how to enhance your advocacy skills on some of the issues highlighted above and others necessary to advance anti-corruption reforms in Nigeria as well as drive transparency and accountability in management of oil revenues accruing to oil producing states.\n\nAfter the workshop, we want to see change agents from among us here, who, with the right knowledge having been trained can use the acquired knowledge to hold government accountable, advocate and push for reforms and the passage of other relevant pending anti-corruption bills. This is particularly important because the project is hinged on the premix that when CSOs and journalists are trained on anti-corruption and social inclusive reforms issues, and they have the right knowledge and skills to engage government collaboratively based on existing data, they will be able to carry out evidence-based advocacy for reforms. Then, they can also influence the development of policies, passage of laws on anti-corruption and social inclusive reforms issues. This is what we aim to achieve with this two-days training and at the end, develop advocacy plan to support the passage of pending anti-corruption bills and other anti-corruption and social inclusive reform issues.\n\nI urge Nigerians to participate with keen interest in these issues to put us all on track of the current political economic analysis and how we can collaboratively engage relevant stakeholders at both national and state levels to drive key reforms.\n\n_______________\n\nRev Ugolor is Executive director ANEEJ.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Such undue practice cannot produce good candidates as the favoured one will be loyal to the godfathers and not to the party and the electorate. Aspirants should be allowed to test their popularity with the party delegates and the voters. That is the basic principle of democracy. They should allow a free and fair contest. Those involved in these shady actions do not love Niger State,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother party chieftain, Yusuf Ibrahim, who spoke in similar vein, recalled that Zamfara State lost all elective seats to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general election for flouting due process in candidates\u2019 election, and warned that such could befall the party if the recent underhand moves are not stopped.\n\nIbrahim said some of the party chieftains who interacted with him are threatening to defect to other parties or get their supporters to cast protest votes if the powers that be in the state hand the ticket to somebody who is unknown to the members, warning that the party may be playing into the hands of the rival PDP which would look to profit from the mistake of the ruling APC in the state. He called on the party to ensure a free and fair contest in the greater interest of the party.\n\nThe leading contenders for the APC governorship ticket in the state are grassroots politician and representative of Chanchaga federal constituency in the House of Representatives since 2011, Hon. Umar Mohammed Bago; incumbent deputy governor, Ahmed Mohammed Ketso; former sports minister, Engr Mohammed Sani Ndanusa; Mohammed Nda (alias Nda Currency); professor of forestry and former SSG to Governor Babangida Aliyu, Mohammed Kuta Yahaya; chairman of Niger State Rice Farmers Association, Idris Usman Makanta, and Blueprint newspaper publisher, Mohammed Idris Malagi, a newcomer to the politics of the state.",

          "text": "Amid the backlash generated by recent reports quoting a Senior Advocate of Nigeria SAN, Chief Robert Clarke as calling for a tenure extension for President Muhammadu Buhari, the ruling All Progressives Congress APC has declared that the president will serve out his term and vacate the presidential villa as stipulated by law.\n\nThis was as the party on Monday inaugurated its 61-member Ekiti state Governorship Campaign Council with an order to the council to ensure victory for the party and not to come back crying after the election.\n\nClarke had in a television interview monitored in Abuja some days ago declared as erroneous, the belief that the President cannot stay in office for more than eight years.\n\n\u201cIf the situation in which we are in now continues and it is impossible to vote in the 2023 election, the constitution says the President will inform the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cIn view of all insurgencies, kidnappings, Boko Haram, I don\u2019t think in these different areas of Nigeria, we can have a good election. I don\u2019t see how what is happening today can be stopped within six months from today or before February next year when the elections will be held,\u201d Mr Clarke had said.\n\nHowever, speaking while inaugurating the council, the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu dismissed concerns about any planned tenure elongation, urging the council to deliver Ekiti to the president as one of his parting gifts.\n\nHe said; \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari is at the beginning of his trip out of the Presidential Villa. He made no secret of it. He is a man of honour, he seeks no extension. He made it public in this very hall that used to be our National Executive Committee NEC meeting hall. He said it that he has been elected for a second time. He is under oath as president to protect and preserve the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution has given him two terms of four years each. He has started his second term and at the end of it, he does not intend to, and will not ask for anybody to ask for a third term or any elongation of tenure.\n\n\u201cRecently, he made the same pronouncement sometimes early this year. So, we are on a boat like him to see that he has a soft landing and that is to deliver this party to victory and Ekiti State is the first test.\n\n\u201cSo, he takes this election very seriously. We would try to do as much as possible, we will be guided by the rules of engagement for elections, we will observe every rule, every guideline and we do hope that those who will be responsible for overseeing the compliance will be fair arbiters, will be fair referees, will be fair umpires.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope and prayer that God Almighty will be with us, will guide us, will ensure that victory is ours\u201d.\n\nHe said Ekiti is the first election that the new National Working Committee NWC will be overseeing, noting that once there is a contest, there will be a winner and a loser, but that the APC will never be on the losing side.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take that for granted. We are going to work as hard as we can to ensure that we deliver our gubernatorial candidate as the next Governor of Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cAs we inaugurate this Committee, I have one thing in the marching order of this party and that is, don\u2019t come home crying, don\u2019t come home crying. If there is a cry, let them (opposition) go and cry for their principals, not us\u201d, he directed.\n\nChairman of the council and Kebbi state Governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu who recalled that about four years ago he had served in the same capacity said it is even now easier to secure victory as the APC is no longer in the opposition in the state.\n\n\u201cThe committee members, Mr Chairman, you mentioned to me privately, why we have so many members in the campaign council and I agreed with you, particularly, Mr Chairman when some people do not appreciate the importance attached to this assignment.\n\n\u201cThis assignment should be acknowledged by all party members because we are only important when we are in power and we know Mr Chairman said we should not come back to complain. We could recall hilariously, Mr Chairman, the 2018 election in Ekiti state was an election in which stomach infrastructure was thrown at us in which someone broke his neck. Well, that is what was said officially all in an attempt to run away from the hard work of the NWC and the Campaign Council in ensuring that we could win Ekiti state.\n\n\u201cNow we are even more competent because, in the last four years, Governor Kayode Fayemi has done a lot to ensure that Ekiti remains a progressive state.\n\nEarlier, National Organizing Secretary of the party, Sulaiman Argungu recalled how the party had conducted a rancour-free Governorship Primary Election where Mr. Biodun Oyebanji emerged as the Ekiti State Gubernatorial Candidate \u201cwithout any of the aspirants sustaining any sorts of action against his triumph at the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal nor at any court of law for that matter\u201d.",

          "text": "Russia\u2019s bloody war with Ukraine could drag on for another decade and leave hundreds of thousands dead, one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s fiercest critics has warned.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun Online, US-born British financier and political activist Bill Browder claimed the West is only waking up to the fact Putin is a \u201cmonster\u201d 22 years too late.\n\n\u201cThis war doesn\u2019t end,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war didn\u2019t start on February 24, it started back in 2014 when Putin seized the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.\u201d\n\nHe accused many in the West of \u201cmental gymnastics\u201d over the past eight years to call the war the work of \u201cRussian-backed separatists,\u201d rather than an official Kremlin-sanctioned mission.\n\nMr Browder has been dubbed one Putin\u2019s \u201ctrue enemies\u201d and is believed to be on the Russian tyrant\u2019s hit list \u2013 with multiple attempts made to arrest him and being subjected to death threats.\n\nHe previously testified to US Congress that mad Vlad is the \u201cthe biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world\u201d \u2013 estimating his fortune could be as much as \u00a3150billion.\n\n\u201cThis war could easily go on for another eight years,\u201d the anti-corruption campaigner told The Sun Online.\n\n\u201cPutin is not going to give up and the Ukrainians are not going to give up.\n\n\u201cThe closest comparable is the Iran-Iraq war which went on a decade and killed a million people.\u201d\n\nHe also warned of a further escalation from Putin if the war continues to go badly for Russia.\n\n\u201cPutin has catastrophically failed both in terms of military strategy and in terms of his interaction with the West,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHis army and economy are being decimated, neither of which he predicted, and I suspect that Putin\u2019s next step is some type of dramatic escalation, if not to give him the upper hand, then at least to show how brutal he is.\u201d\n\nHe said if Putin decided that a military victory was impossible, he would instead target a \u201cscorched earth\u201d policy, repeating the devastation of Mariupol across Ukraine.\n\nThis could be followed by the full mobilisation of up to two million Russian reservists, and even a biological, chemical, or nuclear attack.\n\n\u201cHe has the capability to do all of these things,\u201d Mr Browder added.\n\nBrowder warned that Putin could also be prepared to follow the example of North Korea, and transform his nation into a war economy that exists solely for the conflict with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf Putin wants to do the same as Kim Jong-un he can starve his people and continue fighting for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cHe certainly has the resources.\u201d\n\nHe also denied that Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine were out of character for the Russian President.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

A new date for the exercise will be announced shortly. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.\u201d\n\nS/east, Bankole mull consensus\n\nAnd rising from its meeting Sunday in Abuja, presidential aspirants of the South-east extraction, expressed their readiness to back any of them chosen as a consensus aspirant.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued after the meeting held at Senator Rochas Okorocha\u2019s residence in Abuja, the APC presidential aspirants expressed their commitments to align with any of the South-east aspirants accepted by and chosen by other Nigerians to fly the APC flag.\n\nThe aspirants include; Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Senator Ken Nnamani, Barrister Uju Ken Ohanenye, Governor Dave Umahi, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba and Sen. Okorocha\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 reads: \u201cThat the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the All Progressives Congress and its National Working Committee as well as the teaming members of the party are commended by the entire people of the South-east on their avowed commitment to the unity of Nigeria and the inclusion of all parts of Nigeria in the governance architecture of the country.\n\n\u201cThat we commend all Nigerians who are committed to the Nigerian project by the whole hearted support of the aspiration of the South-east to produce the next Nigerian president in 2023.\n\n\u201cThat in furtherance of this commitment, all aspirants here commit to align with any of the South-east aspirants that is accepted by and chosen by other Nigerians to fly the APC flag.\u201d\n\n\u2026Bankole too\n\nTowing similar line, another presidential aspirant and former Speaker House of Representatives Bankole, called for the adoption of \u201cmodified consensus\u201d as the preferred method for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nAddressing newsmen Sunday in Abuja, the aspirant said, \u201cmodified consensus\u201d remained the best approach and least costly option for the emergence of the party\u2019s flag bearer.\n\nAccording to Bankole, the modified consensus option would see the leadership of the party engaging with the various interest groups in the contest to ensure a hitch-free nomination process.\n\n\u201cConsensus is not the same thing as imposition,\u201d Bankole declared, noting that the current opposition to the consensus arrangement in some quarters may be because \u201cconsensus is being erroneously equated with imposition.\u201d\n\nHe argued that there was a need to lay the anxieties of people currently opposed to the consensus arrangement to rest.\n\nBy embarking on widespread consultations with all interested groups and tendencies in the party, the leadership, he said, would allay all fears concerning the consensus option.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the APC itself was a product of consensus,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cat critical points in the history of Nigeria, consensus had been used to break political logjams.\u201d\n\nHe cited, in particular, the adoption of the \u201cDoctrine of Necessity\u201d during the illness of late President Umar Yar\u2019Adua as a perfect example of the consensus option.\n\nThe former lawmaker also added that the consensus option was adopted in the emergence of the current APC national chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nGiven the heightened national interest in the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate and frenetic jostling by various groups, Bankole averred that \u201cit is incumbent on the leadership of the party to adopt a method that ensures that the party can go to the 2023 elections as a united and formidable entity.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker concluded that he had \u201cimplicit and unalloyed\u201d confidence in the ability of the party leadership to do what is right towards ensuring a united front towards the elections and eventual victory at the 2023 polls.\n\nBuhari holds the ace \u2013 Zulum\n\nAlso weighing in on how best to produce the party\u2019s flag bearer, Governor Zulum said President Muhammadu Buhari would have the final say on who emerges the choice of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nThe governor disclosed this Sunday in Maiduguri while receiving in audience the Rotimi Amaechi campaign team, led by its Director General, Senator Ali Ndume.\n\nAlso on the campaign team were a former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Yusuf Buratai (retd.), and former Inspector-General of Police, Abba Suleiman among others.\n\nThe governor told the aspirant that Borno delegates had no preferred aspirant at the moment, adding however that the delegates would vote a credible candidate based on the preference of the president and their convictions.\n\nHe said: \u201cBorno state delegates will vote based on their conscience. But again, our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, is very important in this political equation. We are still waiting for him to tell us what to do and we will follow. His advice is very important so we have to wait for his advice.\n\n\u201cNigerians should pray for a good candidate to emerge irrespective of tribe, region or ethnic background; a candidate that will ensure the APC forms the central government come 2023.\u201d\n\nAddressing the delegates, Mr Amaechi urged the state delegates to support his aspiration so he could bring an end to insurgency and all forms of insecurity across the country.\n\nAmaechi said he brought about peace, safety, security and stability being enjoyed today in Rivers state as governor, assuring he would replicate same if allowed to fly the APC flag in the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former transport minister said: \u201cWhen I was governor of Rivers State, Buratai was a brigade commander while Abba Suleiman was the police commissioner. We ensured we engaged the teeming and idle youths by giving them jobs that kept them from the street. By so doing, we forestalled peace to the creeks in the state\u201d\n\n\u2018Osinbajo won\u2019t back down\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, The Progressive Project (TPP), the umbrella body of all groups canvassing support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to emerge as APC presidential candidate, has denied a viral video indicating that their principal was planning to step down for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nIn the viral video released Sunday by one Daniel Bwala, an aide to the Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, claimed that the VP was planning to concede to Asiwaju.\n\nBut reacting to the development through a statement made available to Blueprint and signed by the Director of Operations of TPP, Alhaji Usman Aliyu Usman, the body described the claim as false and \u201ca gutter fight which Osinbajo supporters cannot join.\u201d\n\nThe statement warned \u201cpaid agents\u201d to stop the spread of falsehoods against Vice President Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cOne of our visible supporters, Professor Olusola Adeyeye, a two-term Senator who represented Osun Central Senatorial District between 2011 to 2019 made some weighty statements about the APC presidential primaries on Saturday and by Sunday, really baseless and mischievous anti-Osinbajo statements began circulating.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, one of these came from Mr. Daniel Bwala, an aide to Deputy Senate President, Senator Omo-Agege who currently appears to moonlight as spokesman for the Bola Tinubu campaign.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, without any proof, Mr. Bwala started circulating a video clip with claims that Professor Yemi Osinbajo is \u2018allegedly planning to step down for Asiwaju\u2019; Mr. Bwala had no evidence and he ought to know better than going to town with such.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, Professor Yemi Osinbajo is still riding high in the race and our decision not to interfere in some camps\u2019 deliberate spread of illusion and untruths is only motivated by our genuine confidence in our candidate\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cAs stated long ago, no group linked to TPP will join any individual or group in playing gutter politics or smearing others but we need to unequivocally state that Professor Yemi Osinbajo is not contemplating any measure of capitulation to any candidate.\n\n\u201cWhile we are sworn to total allegiance to the Constitution, patriotic values and the spirit of good sportsmanship, we denounce the misleading information and unbecoming tricks that some supporters in other presidential candidates\u2019 camps embrace so eagerly.\n\n\u201cWe denounce too, the baseless ad unhelpful information being randomly disseminated by the likes of Mr. Bwala.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of the nation and its democracy, TPP appeals to all aspirants and supporters at all levels to learn from the focused and principled campaign methods of Professor Osinbajo and his supporters whose collective determination towards actualising Nigeria\u2019s enduring greatness is a cause that genuinely deserves the support of all patriots.\n\n\u201cWe categorically debunk the spate of falsehoods against PYO\u2019s candidature and we urge all Nigerian patriots to look forward to join us in the forthcoming celebrations on the day after APC presidential primaries,\u2019 the TPP official stated.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",
          "summary": "Deputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\nHe added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities.\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders.",

Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi, will take charge of campaign and marketing our candidate for the Ekiti governorship election.\n\nAdamu said the fact that the outcome of the primary election that produced Mr Biodun Oyebanji as the party candidate for the election was unchallenged, meant that it was thoroughly done.\n\n\u201cOnce there is a contest, there will be a winner and a loser, we are never on the losing side.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t take that for granted, we are going to work as hard as we can to ensure that we deliver our governorship candidate as the next governor of Ekiti State\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that a victory for APC in Ekiti would be a good way to start the end of the second term of office of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cSo, President Buhari takes this election very seriously,\u201d Adamu said.\n\nHe added that the party would be guided by the rules of engagement for election, in spite of its desire to win.

I\u2019m here not only as Senatorial candidate but as a loyal party man who also believe in the competence and capacity of Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji to provide good governance in Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cOf course after the primary in January, many people thought we would challenge it in court but I knew that was not the way to go. I told my supporters that it\u2019s a family affair that must be treated within the family. I thank my brother, Governor John Kayode Fayemi, I thank the first lady and other leaders for the roles they played in making sure the family ties remain intact,\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the preparation of the party to win the June 18 election, Bamidele commended the various groups for their selfless sacrifice which made the event possible.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday is memorable in the history of our great party and the state because what is happening is a demonstration of the fact that politics has indeed gone back to the people. I\u2019m particularly excited because people have realized the need for participatory politics. I want to implore our people to move out and preach the gospel according to BAO for us to be victorious on June 18.\n\nEkiti State First Lady, Erelu Bisi Fayemi who spoke on the need for continuity at the event saluted all the support groups as well as the Women Campaign Council for their efforts towards BAO\u2019s victory in the coming governorship election.\n\nShe pointed out that continuity would lead to the retention of various laudable achievements of the outgoing administration.\n\n\u201cYou will all agree with me that Ekiti is not developing at the pace other developed states are developing. The reason is simple; there is no consistency in administrations as we see in Lagos and many other other states,\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Chairman of BAO Anchor Organization, Hon. Gbenga Agbeyo said the Anchor groups were committed to ensuring that total victory was record for the APC governorship candidate come June 18.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, a former APC State Chairman, Chief Jide Awe also admitted that there hasn\u2019t been anytime members of the public showed commitment to who governs them in Ekiti as being witnessed now.\n\nAwe called on APC leaders and members not to relent in their efforts at recording a landslide victory in the coming election.\n\nThe APC governorship candidate, Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji in his response thanked members of the BAO Anchor Organization for their support and promised to fulfil all his promises to Ekiti people if emerged as governor come June 18.\n\n\u201cI stand before you today that I will not disappoint you. That I will fulfil all my promises,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe governorship candidate, who restated his commitment to issue- based campaign, called on party members to refrain from any act of violence during the electioneering period. He said the record of performance of the APC- led administration in the state and the massive support of the people were enough to earn the party victory at the June 18 election.",

We have consistently maintained our stellar AAA credit ratings by all major global credit rating agencies, who consistently praise our excellent risk management at the bank.\n\n\u201cWe have an excellent and robust management and governance system. We deliver great value for our clients in Africa. Over the past six years, through our High five programmes, our work has impacted on 335 million people. We deliver great value.\u201d\n\nThe AfDB president also tweeted that independently conducted survey by a global HR firm found 85 per cent of staff are happy with the bank, an exceptionally high level for any institution globally, adding that despite COVID-19 and challenges of working from home, 97 per cent of staff were pleased wit provided by the bank.\n\nHe said, \u201cIT services support Our achievements, exceptional management, good governance systems, and delivery of the Bank cannot be denied or misrepresented based on externally fabricated lies, distortions, misinformation, and deliberately orchestrated campaign of calumny to attempt to tarnish our image.\n\n\u201cWe will tell our story. We will not be defined by mischief makers, lies and biases. We are proudly African.
