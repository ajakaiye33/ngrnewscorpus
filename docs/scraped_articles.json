          "text": "The World Health Organisation has said Nigeria is currently undergoing an outbreak of yellow fever with a total of 172 deaths reported across five states in the country.\n\nThe body made this known in a recent report titled, \u2018WHO supports Nigeria in responding to the yellow fever outbreak amidst an ongoing pandemic\u2019.\n\nAccording to the WHO, a total of 530 suspected cases have also been reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.\n\nIt stated, \u201cThe World Health Organisation is supporting Nigeria to respond to the outbreak. As of December 3 and since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 530 suspected and 48 confirmed cases have been reported by the country\u2019s Centre for Disease Control, with 172 deaths among suspected cases across the five affected states. Sample testing is ongoing at the national reference laboratories in the country.\n\n\u201cWith the onset of the current outbreak, epidemiologists and other health professionals have been deployed in each of the affected states. Outbreak investigation is ongoing through Rapid Response Teams under the coordination of respective state ministries of health. Workers at selected hospitals in each of the five affected states have been trained and provided with supplies to treat yellow fever patients.\n\n\u201cThe relative proximity of Delta, Enugu, Benue and Ebonyi states with Lagos is an added concern, because the introduction of yellow fever outbreaks in urban environments with a large unvaccinated population can lead to rapid amplification with associated severe impacts. Population movements that could contribute to spreading of the virus may have been reduced in the COVID-19 context. However, there is a lack of data on this, and the risk of spread should be monitored.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "APM Terminals Apapa handles 8.1 million TEUs in 15 years",
          "text": "By Godwin Oritse\n\nNigeria\u2019s largest container terminal, APM Terminals Apapa handled a little above 8.1 million twenty equivalent units (TEU) of containers in the past 15 years.\n\nTerminal Manager of APM Terminals Apapa, Steen Knudsen, said container volumes at the terminal have increased by an average of 23 percent annually over the past five years.\n\n\u201cWe handled 8,134, 847 TEUs of containers since 2006 and more than 650,000 TEUs per year in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 the majority of that being import volume. Over the last years we have managed to grow the business extensively \u2013 by 23 percent per annum on average. We are continuously making our terminal operations more efficient,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSOOromoni: Police release body to family after fresh autopsy\n\n\u201cWhile there is a compelling need to reduce the dwell time of containers at the terminal, there are several factors \u2013 most of them beyond the control of a terminal operator \u2013 that make it possible for consignees to keep their containers at the terminal for a long period of time.\n\n\u201cAs a terminal, we are interested in ensuring that dwell time remains as low as possible. However, there are processes in place that we are not in direct control of. These include customs clearing processes and related processes of other government agencies such as the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and so on. These agencies all have to approve the movement of cargo out of the port. The more in harmony this process can work, the faster the cargo can move through the terminal and hence reduce cost for the importers.\n\n\u201cAnother very relevant factor at the moment in terms of cargo flow is the foreign exchange rate to the US dollar, which is starting to hurt the Nigerian importers, and cargo seems to be slowing down simply because warehouses are getting full. Hence it is more likely that the container will stand in the seaport for a longer time,\u201d Mr. Knudsen said.\n\nHe said the strategy of APM Terminals Apapa is to be the preferred logistics gateway into the Nigerian economy, and in doing so \u2013 to provide world-class services.\n\n\u201cWorld-class services mean the shipping lines that come in get a consistent and cost-efficient product, i.e. that we handle their vessels fast, hence translating into a reduced cost of import and export in the market.\n\n\u201cFor the Nigerian importers and exporters, it would mean that our efficiency on the waterfront allows us to be also cost-efficient in terms of facilitating their trade back into the market.\n\n\u201cAnother element of strategy is, of course, continuous building and strengthening our operations in Nigeria. APM Terminals is a global company, and as such we bring in international practices and best standards when it comes to facilitating the international flow and international trade into the market. And it is also important for the terminal to continuously focus on customer-centricity and on creating a consistent and safe environment for our employees.\n\n\u201cCustomer centricity is not just about shipping lines, but also about internal customers to ensure that all the processes are consistent and efficient for facilitating their trades. For our employees, it means we are the preferred employer; that we continuously offer the best facilities and safe operations so that they have long-term employment with us, can develop themselves and go home safely at the end of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nAPM Terminals Apapa is the largest container terminal in West Africa. With an investment of over USD438 million in equipment, facilities and other elements of its operations over the last 15 years; the terminal has continued to introduce new innovations to help both shipping lines and landside customers achieve improved supply chain efficiency and flexibility in a cost-effective manner.",

          "text": "By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nHouse of Representatives may not bat an eyelid in overriding President Muhammadu Buhari on the yet-to-be assented electoral amended bill.\n\nThis is because the constitutional 30 days window given to the president to give his assent or withhold same to the bill of the national assembly has elapsed.\n\nSunday, December 19, 2021 was the deadline, marking exactly 30 days the bill was transmited to the President to sign it into law.\n\nAs at now, there is no communication from the President to the House on whether he will be giving or withholding his assent to the bill.\n\nBarring any last minute eventuality, the National will be vacating on Tuesday for the 2021 Christmas holidays.\n\nResumption is expected to be in the second week of January, 2022.\n\nSection 58 (4) of the 1999 (as amended) stipulates that \u201cWhere a bill is presented to the President for assent, he shall within thirty days thereof signify that he assents or that he withholds assent.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:Electoral Bill: Reps set to override Buhari, pass document into law\n\nSimilarly, section 58 (5) provides thus \u201cWhere the President withholds his assent and the bill is again passed by each House by two-thirds majority, the bill shall become law and the assent of the President shall not be required.\u201d\n\nThe implication of this section is that If the President withholds his assent and it is again taken to both Houses of the National Assembly, two-thirds majority of both Houses must pass the Bill.\n\nIf two-thirds majority in each House pass the Bill, then that Bill becomes law and the Presidents\u2019 assent i.e. approval is no longer needed or required.\n\nIt will be recalled that two major contentious clauses in the bill were the electronic transmission of election results and the direct mode of primaries for political parties to choose their candidates for elections.\n\nAmidst the debate on the two clauses, however, the electoral umpire, Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC has repeatedly cleared the air, saying those are no issues.\n\nIn their different reactions to the deadline, some members of the House who spoke exclusively to Vanguard on Sunday said they will override the President to make the bill a law.\n\nThe House should veto the President-Hon. Ifeanyi Momah, representing Ihiala federal constituency of Anambra State\n\n\u201cIt is simple. The House should veto. That is the most conscionable and honorable thing to do, considering the level of \u201cpolitical awareness\u201d and \u201cGet involved\u201d spirit from everyone. Just open up the system for all and sundry with no exceptions.\n\n\u201cI \u2018ll lobby for NASS to override the President- Hon. Henry Nwawuba, member representing Mbaitolu/Ikeduru federal Constituency of Imo State\n\n\u201cThe electoral act amendment is perceived from different perspectives by different stakeholders. For those who want Direct Primaries they are unable to weigh in on the weightier matters of the amendment particularly in relation to enthroning electronic voting options as a way to deepen our democratic experiences.\n\n\u201cWhat worries me is that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water. I will lobby, support and campaign vigorously for us to invoke section 58 sub 5 of the 1999 Constitution and go ahead and override Mr. President so that the Bill become Law.\n\n\u201cThe Bill contains many innovations that promote transparency to our democratic experiment, concerning the electronic transmission of election results and the mode of selecting candidates by political parties during primaries.\n\nPresident\u2019s problem is electronic transmission of election results ember representing Obio/Akpor- Hon. Kingsley Chinda, member representing Obio/Akpor federal constituency of Rivers State\n\n\u201cThe President is only toying with the psychic of Nigerians. His problem with the electoral act is not the direct primaries but the direct transmission of results from the units. They do not want direct transmission and are only using the direct party primaries as an excuse.\n\n\u201cI will only say that power comes from God, the antics of the President and some of his party members will not stand if God does not permit.\n\n\u201cI have long lost hope in the ability of the 9th NASS to confront the Executive on behalf of Nigerians when the Senate President unapologetically said that whatever the President wants, he will do. I hope to be disappointed or proved wrong by NASS successfully overriding the President.\u201d\n\nHowever, a former member of the House who represented Jos North/Jos South Federal Constituency of Plateau State, Hon Edward Pwajok, SAN, said that the President can still respond even after the time has elapsed.\n\n\u201cThe President can still respond after the one month the Constitution has provided for him to sign or decline assent to bills sent to him. The National Assembly has to decide whether they want to override the President\u2019s veto.\n\n\u201cPresidential veto arises where the President formally communicates his decision declining assent or is implied where he does not do anything on the bill sent to him after 30 days. The National Assembly can only override the veto by two thirds majority of all the members of each chamber of the National Assembly, so the National Assembly leadership\n\nmust be satisfied that they have the numbers to override the veto before embarking on that course and if they do, the bill must undergo the same procedure of three readings, though it can be fast tracked.\n\n\u201cIn between the one month and when the National Assembly decides on the next line of action, the President can still validly communicate his decision. The 30 days is not a time limit for him to act. Section 58 of the Constitution is the provision that guides and regulates passage of bills and assent or veto override.\u201d",

          "text": "The apex socio-cultural organization in Igboland, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has reaffirmed the belief of the Igbo people in the unity of Nigeria.\n\nIn a Christmas and New Year address presented by Professor George Obiozor, the President-General of the group, at a press conference held in Owerri, the Imo State capital, and forwarded to DAILY POST on Sunday, the group insisted that the Igbo nation seek justice as, throughout history, those denied justice have had no interest in peace.\n\nHe also maintained that a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction has become imperative and an idea whose time has come, adding that it is a national necessity that is anchored on equity, justice and fairness.\n\nObiozor further reiterated that a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction is politically justifiable and morally defensible, positing also that it would heal and unite the nation.\n\nHe disclosed that Ohanaeze Ndigbo will soon announce a political action committee to canvass for the support and understanding of other Nigerians towards the actualization of a President of the Igbo bloc.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cbe not discouraged, the Igbo struggle for Justice, equity and fairness in Nigeria has been long and agonizing but there is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\u201cAs Nelson Mandela said, it looks impossible until it is done. With the new narratives of courage without rancour wisdom without humility, we will be able to persuade our fellow Nigerians that it is time to reintegrate Ndigbo effectively into the mainstream of Nigerian political process and governance. This is in the national interest.\u201d\n\nObiozor expressed dismay that Igbo talents and ability to turn adversities into advantages, obstacles into opportunities and difficulties into dividends have been misrepresented as attempts at domination hence confronted with anger, hostility and violence at any given crisis in Nigeria and even outside the country.\n\nObiozor partly stated, \u201cIn fact, no people in recent history have been unfortunate or at best had a mixed fortune or blessings as Ndigbo in Nigeria politics and governance. For example, quite often the Igbo energy and enterprise were misunderstood as being over-ambitious.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, the country for the purpose of healing the Nation and creative use of crises and conflicts yielded the Presidency to the South West. I ask Ndigbo everywhere from today to make every effort to convince other Nigerians in Political parties and organizations that ours is a righteous cause whose time has come\u201d.",

          "title": "BOOK OF THE YEAR: A FRONT ROW PARTICIPANT\u2019S ACCOUNT",
          "text": "It is a series of words as pinprick. It began as a book presentation, and the bigwigs of the Nigerian political firmament gathered, especially of the APC hue. The president, Muhammadu Buhari, in his full light-blue babaringa and loosed-limbed with humour, was accompanied by a raft of governors. That day drew praise for the book, from all sides. Asiwaju Bola Tinubu called him a hero. The president draped him as a rare specimen of integrity. Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation, regarded him as a political icon. The book reviewer and this newspaper\u2019s Editor-at-Large, Segun Ayobolu, pronounced what was to come. He called it a bomb.\n\nSo it has been, a work of barely over 500 pages has been a detonation from denotations. Titled My Participations, former governor of Osun State and former chairman of unprecedented four political parties, Chief Bisi Akande, weaves a skein of his life, but in a larger context it is the political yarn of his generation.\n\nBut he trades tackles with his bare but direct style. There have been quite a few persons uncomfortable with his narratives. Some have so far been quiet, especially former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The retired general and a perennial figure in Nigeria\u2019s contemporary history, comes out of Akande\u2019s telling as a crafty subvert. He is always on the malevolent side of the narrative and Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\nAnother person he overwhelmed with his ire was his deputy as governor of Osun State. He tracked how he fell for the deceptions of a wily man. He became a major stud and matador of retrogression. He eventually became the one who lost his job rather than Akande who was first marked for eviction from the State House. The Ife titan has remained mum.\n\nBut others have squalled in protest. One of them is a chieftain of Yoruba politics, Ayo Adebanjo, who emerges as an undercutting work horse for the obstructions of the Yoruba march forward. He is a follower of Awo who even in Awo\u2019s lifetime was painted in unflattering light with his friend and fellow traveller Olaniwun Ajayi during the fraught era of military overthrow when Akande, Bola Ige and others spent years in Buhari\u2019s gaol. What he has been loud about though is Akande\u2019s reporting that he obtained a certificate of occupancy for a plot at Lekki Phase one from former Lagos State Governor Tinubu who also helped build the house in which he currently lives.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAlso, in an outburst is the former army officer and Akande\u2019s successor as governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who railed about his reporting of graft and lack of faith concerning the construction and siting of a government house.\n\nBoth Oyinlola and Adebanjo belong to countervailing signposts in Southwest politics. Many do not expect them to look at the world from the same lens.\n\nIt has drawn flak from the Presidency about how the vice president was nominated. The vice president who has said his bit long ago has been quiet but others have taken the bait. A newspaper supposedly quoting sources close to the president claimed there was no agreement between the then candidate Buhari and Tinubu to pair the former governor as his running mate. They claimed it was a partnership, and they implied that both agreed on vague terms of engagement.\n\nThe book is not just about these men. Chief Akande reflected a political atmosphere that was marked by shysters as heroes. He took Awolowo for his hero and ensign, and the track light for the west.\n\nNo book has generated thus far this sort of flap since one of his targets, Obasanjo, penned a war memoir that he alone seems to be participant and witness to.\n\nAkande\u2019s My Participations will shake and echo in the political world for a long time.

          "title": "TRAGEDY OF THE YEAR: IKOYI FOURSCORE TOWER COLLAPSE",
          "text": "Tragically, this was a many-sided tragedy. It was a tragedy not only because a spectacular high-rise under construction in a highbrow neighbourhood was reduced to a lowly status. The 21-storey giant on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, had a great fall on November 1.\n\nIt was a tragedy not only because many people who were at the site, for one reason or another, died. The number of fatalities was 46. Each death was a tragedy in its own right. Luckily, 15 others were pulled out alive from the rubble.\n\nIt was a tragedy not only because the dead included the ambitious builder of the ambitious residential tower and CEO of Fourscore Homes, Femi Osibona. He was aged 55.\n\nHe had a grand architectural dream. The fallen tower was one of three towers, collectively known as 360 Degrees Towers. He painted a picture of the project in an interview three months before the tragedy. \u201cWe are actually building a seven-star hotel,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThey are flats, but we make it feel like you are living in a seven-star hotel. Everything that is in a seven-star hotel, you will have there. But the only difference is that you own the property. We have not advertised and we have sold more than 50 per cent\u2026Here in 360, we have security, exceptional view, offices, clubhouse, and open recreation area. Practically everything you have in a seven-star hotel.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was a tragedy not only because the building collapse raised questions about structural integrity and the builder\u2019s integrity. The project and the builder attracted attention in 2020 when it was reported that Osibona had tried to prevent officials of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) from sealing off the building in question. The agency was said to have observed some \u201canomalies.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s general manager, Gbolahan Oki, was quoted as saying Osibona \u201cgot an approval for a 15-storey building and he exceeded his limit\u2026and the materials he used are so inferior and terrible. The materials he used, the reinforcement, are so terrible. He got approval for 15 floors but built 21.\u201d\n\nThere was a controversy over the number of floors he got approval to build. It was confusing that some high-level state officials claimed the builder got approval for 21 floors.\n\nThe tragedy was heightened following the release of the outcome of a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d by the Nigerian Institution of Structural Engineers (NIStructE). Significantly, the body said what it found out would \u201cgive a general indication of what likely led to the unfortunate incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe building that collapsed was initially designed for just six floors, and later to 12 floors, before this was further changed to 15 floors,\u201d according to NIStructE president Kehinde Osifala.\n\nHe said in a statement: \u201cIt could not yet be established the adequacy of any properly designed and documented further revision to the eventual (and tragically, final) 21 floors that was being implemented and which collapsed.\u201d\n\nThe professional body said the preliminary investigation \u201calso revealed some evidence of structural inadequacy in the construction and that signs of some structural distress had already started to show within certain elements of the building.\u201d\n\nWhatever measures the builders took to address the observed defects were futile, the body noted, because \u201cthe method of implementation of this was not in accordance with sound structural engineering practices.\u201d\n\nThis picture suggested that disregard for building standards, poor workmanship and materials, and a lack of official oversight were to blame.\n\nIt is incomprehensible how a building allegedly designed to have six floors became a 21-storey tower. Nobody needs building engineering expertise to know that such a building, without appropriate intervention, was a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nIt was a tragedy not only because the disaster was avoidable. It was a tragedy not only because the crumbled tower was said to lack insurance cover. After the tragedy, the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) highlighted the importance of respecting building rules, and having insurance to minimise losses.\n\nPerhaps predictably, the Lagos State government set up a panel to investigate the tragedy. The public awaits the result of the probe. It remains to be seen whether the outcome of the probe will help prevent avoidable building collapse, which has become tragically familiar.",

          "text": "Self-determination is a fundamental right\u2026that cannot be subjugated \u2013 Justice Akintola\n\nAgitations for self-determination are not new. They started long ago as people who speak the same language and perhaps share the same faith and boundary resolve to come together as one. Their common affinity is the sole determinant of their struggle for a common entity. The struggle is usually long and tortuous wherever this set of people seeks to quit a nation state. In some cases, the state labels them as rebels and go all out to kill their struggle. At times, the agitators too pay with their lives. Is there anything wrong in agitations for self-determination? No, says Justice Ladiran Akintola of the Ibadan High Court, in his verdict on the case of Yoruba Nation agitator Chief Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho against the Federal Government.\n\nNigeria was virtually drowned in the wave of such agitations in the outgoing year. Groups and people rose in some parts of the country, demanding that they be allowed to go. The agitations were pronounced in the Southwest and Southeast. That of the Southeast, however, took a different bent. The arrowhead of the campaign, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wanted secession. Having travelled that road between 1967 and 1970, the elders, who witnessed the three-year civil war during which a million people were killed, did not want the region to go that way again. Yet, Kanu, who is in custody facing treasonable felony trial, found support in the youths, who have been holding the region down, with a weekly sit-at-home order enforced every Monday.\n\nAre self-determination and secession the same thing? A thin line runs through them. Self-determination is a peaceful agitation to leave a country, while secession is forceful separation from an entity. People resort to secession where they are oppressed or the government is illegitimate. This is where Kanu and Igboho are different. Igboho hit the limelight with his exploits in Igangan, a community in Oyo State, in the heat of the herders and farmers skirmishes. He took sides with the farmers to chase out herders said to be wreaking havoc on the community. Igboho, who is battling for his release from custody in Cotonou, Benin Republic, ran into trouble with the government, which saw him as an existential threat.\n\nHis home in Soka, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, was invaded by security operatives in the wee hours of July 1. Some of his properties, including vehicles, were destroyed. One of his cats was also taken away by the security agents who believed that it was Igboho who turned into a cat! Igboho fled the country, but he was arrested in Cotonou on his way to Germany. His arrest and detention over there did not stop him from challenging the legality of the invasion of his home. He also sought the determination of the propriety of the Yoruba\u2019s struggle for self-determination. He won on both counts. Justice Akintola declared the agitation for self-determination as legitimate.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to him, \u2018\u2019Chief Sunday Adeyemo and his group have a right to self-determination and are free to hold their rallies as long as they are peaceful. Self-determination is one of the fundamental human rights of the citizens that cannot be subjugated\u2019\u2019. His finding was premised on Igboho\u2019s request for:\n\nA declaration that he and his Yoruba indigenous people have unquestionable and/or inalienable fundamental right to peacefully campaign and seek self-determination of Yoruba tribe in Nigeria and lobby the legislature to amend the 1999 Constitution as guaranteed by Article 20 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Right (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, Laws of the Federation 2010, and Articles 3, 4, 7 & 18 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Indigenous People, thereby insulating campaign for self-determination from criminal culpability.\n\nA declaration that the respondents\u2019 resolve to prevent the applicant from propagating his belief in association with other like-minds in creating a Yoruba Nation and/or Oduduwa Republic for his Indigenous Yoruba People and hunting him with gun with a view to arresting him dead or alive when he has not called for war in achieving same is against his fundamental rights to freedom of thought, conscience and association since campaign for self-determination is recognised by law and international treaties of organisations to which Nigeria belongs.\n\nIt is a landmark decision on a vexed issue which has been threatening the fabric of society.",

          "title": "CONTROVERSY OF THE YEAR: THE WAR OVER VAT",
          "text": "One controversy that Nigerians will not forget in a hurry when reviewing 2021 is the Value Added Tax over which the Federal Government and State Governments literally fought over who should collect and how it should be shared among the tiers of government. The heated debate was not a straight one between the federal and sub-national governments, the Organised Private Sector, lawyers, Civil Society Organisations, the academia and many others joined in the spar. Yet, it is one controversy that has refused to go away as it is yet before the judiciary for adjudication.\n\nThe governor of Rivers State, Mr. Nyesom Wike, took the bull by the horn by approaching a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt to resolve who, under the law, has the right to collect and expend the Tax that is basically a consumption tax. He contended that consumption tax is a residual responsibility over which the federal government has no control and that the Federal Inland Revenue Service that has been performing the function is merely an interloper acting ultra vires.The Rivers State governor equally argued powerfully that the constitution that is the grundnorm in the country does not list the tax among those that the federal government whether exclusively or concurrently with states could collect and share.\n\nThe state was later joined by Lagos that generates the largest amount given its population, relative prosperity and strategic location. The states won at the High Court, but the battle still rages. The Federal Government has since decided to take the matter to the Court of Appeal, with Oyo State joining the fray.\n\nWhere would this lead? Is the federal government being greedy in seeking to have the FIRS take charge? This may not be exactly so. Under the existing formula by which proceeds of the Tax is shared, the federal government only retains 15 per cent, while the states share 50 per cent, and the local governments are allowed to use 35 per cent. But, the issue is deeper than the amount actually retained by the central government. At stake is control and proprietary right. Also, the states think the federal government is already controlling so much of the national wealth through its share of the Federation Account, mining of solid minerals aviation, railways and waterways, among so many others. The states believe that the national government has its knees on their necks and they are unable to breathe. It took a similar grim fight for the Lagos State government to win control over sales tax from the hotels. Until 2019 when the court awarded control to the state government, the federal government had controlled proceeds from the sector.\n\nThe major difference in the current dispute is that the states are not unanimous. States that generate very little in terms of Value Added Tax are in support of the Federal Government. Many of them have argued that the relatively richer states should be their \u201cbrothers\u2019 keepers\u201d. The inequity and injustice in distributing the proceeds is at the heart of the judicial contest. While, in the first eight months of this year, Lagos State raked in N429 billion, it received N139 billion. Rivers generated N90 billion, but was allocatedN47 billion, behind Kano that generated N24 billion and got allocated N47 billion. Oyo State was allocated N18 billion, despite bringing 64 billion into the coffers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMore stupefying, perhaps, is the case of Zamfara that got an allocation of N59 billion despite generating less than one billion Naira. This has been described as grossly unfair and the basis for demanding that states should take full charge of the process. Contrary to the contention of some, it is not a geo-political contest. The South East States collectively generated about N22 billion, while Kano, as earlier indicated generates N24 billion.\n\nOver the years, the VAT that was first introduced under the Babangida administration has grown to become a major funding source for state governments. In the past four years, about N10 trillion was generated as VAT and shared. It has therefore been argued that withdrawing the feeding bottle could lead to asphyxiation of some states. The contest has become intractable, essentially because at the heart of it is inequity, injustice, opaqueness and suspicion of the federal government. There are tributaries of the central contention such as who controls import duties. In 2020, this accounted for 22.7 per cent of the VAT, while foreign non-import VAT amounted to 27.4 per cent. That is another battle ahead.\n\nAs the country looks forward to 2022, it is in the interest of the stakeholders to resolve the matter amicably to protect all. But, in all, unless equity and justice prevails, there will be no resolution.",

          "text": "Nigerians will not forget in a hurry, the scandals involving music diva, Tiwa Savage, and widely acclaimed \u2018super cop\u2019 DCP Abba Kyari. Both of them are celebrities in their own right but they were in the news for the wrong reasons. First was music diva, Tiwa Savage, whose sex tape set cyberspace agog. Social media pulsed with outrage as fans of the music artiste and her critics went to war soon before and after the release of a sex video featuring Savage.\n\nThe artiste hinted in an interview with American radio host, Angie Martinez, of Power 105.1 that she was being blackmailed with the sex tape and would rather release it than succumb to the designs of her blackmailer. The prior warning by the Afrobeats singer, predictably, set tongues wagging.\n\nAt the heel of her disclosure during the interview, the divorced mother of one revealed that the video features her and her current partner and that her blackmailer commenced his threats immediately after it was mistakenly uploaded online by her partner.\n\nSavage claimed that although the latter promptly deleted the video soon after he accidentally posted it on Snapchat, in error, it was too late.\n\nShe said, \u201cYesterday, I was leaving a radio station and I was in my car when my road manager sent me a message. She said I should check my phone. I checked it and there was a video, and I was just like \u2018Wow!\u2019,\u201d she told Martinez.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI asked him where he got it from and he said he received it about 20 minutes earlier. The video was sent to him and it is a tape of me and the person I am dating right now. The first thing I did after I got off the phone was that I sent it to my manager and asked what we should do.\n\n\u201cThe person is asking for money now. The person I am dating is going crazy too. My manager asked how much the person is asking for.\u201d\n\nBut the singer said she had decided not to pay the blackmailer because blackmailers usually come for more.\n\n\u201cI decided I was not going to pay the person because if I do, two months from now, three months down the line, or even two years later, you are going to come back again. Who knows, if I send the money, the person will probably release it. I am not going to let anyone blackmail me for doing something natural.\u201d\n\nThe singer further stressed that she will not give a dime to her blackmailers. Savage stated that she could release the video herself because she is \u2018that crazy\u2019.\n\nThe news caught the attention of her fans in Nigeria and across the world. When the video was later leaked online it sparked conversation both online and offline.\n\nJust before Savage\u2019s sex debacle, Nigerians stirred to the shocking news of popular supercop and head of the Nigerian Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Abba Kyari\u2019s alleged complicity in fraudulent transactions involving suspected internet fraudster, Abbas Ramon, aka Hushpuppi.\n\nThe United States (US) crime fighter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in investigations made the declaration indicting Kyari in a $1.1m fraud case alongside five others, including United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based Abbas.\n\nThe FBI had reportedly filed a criminal complaint at the United States District Court in California listing Abbas Ramon, aka Hushpuppi; and Kyari among others indicted in the $1.1m international fraud conspiracy.\n\nOther suspects include AbdulRahman Juma (Abdul); Vincent Kelly Chibuzo (Kelly); Rukayat Motunrayo Fashola\n\n(Morayo); and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka (Bolamide).\u201d\n\nUntil his indictment, Kyari was seen as a fearless crime fighter and outstanding officer presumably honest and committed to his work.\n\nHe was particularly notable for arresting the dreaded billionaire kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike aka Evans, and ending the reign of terror of armed robbers and kidnappers in the southeast, among other numerous heroic exploits.\n\nAt his indictment, Kyari\u2019s critics emerged from the woodwork claiming that he had always been a suspicious cop whose association with questionable characters were red flags that ought to have been taken cognizance of.\n\nKyari, according to an FBI affidavit is \u201calleged to have arranged for Vincent, Abbas\u2019 rival in crime to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest.\n\n\u201cKyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nBut in a swift rebuttal on Facebook, Abba Kyari denied the allegations claiming the only monetary transaction between him and Abbas was the N300,000 sent by the latter to him for onward payment to his cloth vendor. Kyari said he introduced the tailor to Abbas after the latter expressed the desire to buy some native attires he (Kyari) shared on his Facebook page.\n\nFurther allegations held that Kyari abandoned his official duty post in September 2019, and flew to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to frolic with the most wanted internet conman,s according to the FBI.",

          "text": "By Christian Agadibe\n\nNollywood actress, Ngozi Ezeh has been having her fair share of love advances from fans, as some of them kept flooding her with marriage proposals.\n\nIn this interview, the ever-smiling mother of three talks about how she copes with randy men. Excerpts:\n\nCan you recall the year you started acting?\n\nI started acting professionally in 2000. And then I had to withdraw a little to attend to the children, and now that they have fully grown, I had to come back.\n\nWhat was your first movie?\n\nMy first movie was titled, God Where Are You?\n\nLooking back, in terms of comparison, what would you say is different in the industry?\n\nBack in the days, you must know a producer or be in good terms with him, and then he would have to favour you by giving you a movie role. But now, your craft is being appreciated the more, if it\u2019s not good enough, you are going nowhere.\n\nWhat differentiates the social media acting from the real Nollywood acting?\n\nThen, the industry was centered only in the open market, but now you have different markets such as YouTube, Netflix etc., and different platforms where you can showcase your films and crafts.\n\nWhat good or harm would you say social media has done to the movie industry?\n\nSocial media has helped the movie industry in mitigating copyright and piracy. Social media has brought a lot of enlightenment to Nollywood and has showcased us and our platforms; while also providing a beautiful landing for our jobs.\n\nWhat project are you currently working on?\n\nI am working on a project directed by Ebizu. My character in the movie is Madam Veronica, a matron in the hospital and she wasn\u2019t privileged to have children. So, when the unfortunate couple that got stranded came to her to help deliver their baby, she helped quite alright, but ended up stealing one of the twin girls delivered.\n\nWho exactly is Ngozi Ezeh aside the one always acting the good role in movies?\n\nI am a pleasant and easy-going woman, and I believe what is fair is fair. That\u2019s my life. I am very straightforward; I like life when it is easy going. It costs little to do good and so much to do evil because you have a lot to contend with.\n\nYou rarely play bad character in movies, why?\n\nI do bad character in movies too, like I did in Royal Glory and Royal Wars, among others. My look doesn\u2019t really change anything, but they always make me play the emotional part because they feel I can cry easily, and that my face appears emotional. I wonder from where they got that.\n\nHow do you manage both your family and acting?\n\nThe kids are grown now; they are all in the university. When you build your life on transparency, it goes a long way to help you be and do whatever you want to do in your life. If you start early to build a trustworthy relationship with honesty, you would not need to worry about anything. And God is always there to guide us.\n\nWould you support any of your daughters to follow your footstep and be an actress?\n\nExcellently! Acting is a worthy profession, and as long as you know your onions, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nHas fame denied you of anything in life?\n\nNever.\n\nHow have you been able to manage life as a civil servant and actress?\n\nI go to work very early to do my job and get back early to be on movie set. Being an actress has given me a lot of opportunities and has helped me in my job as well, because people tend to trust you more with information as an actress.\n\nWhat is the craziest thing a fan has done to you?\n\nDespite knowing that I\u2019m married, some fans still tell me \u2018I love you and I want to marry you\u2019.\n\nYou mean you still get toasters even as a married woman?\n\nOf course, yes. Even if you are 100 years old, men will still toast you. If they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you, they will still toast you so that when you commit a mistake, they can use it against you.\n\nHave you had any experience as regards sex for role?\n\nNot at all.\n\nWhat is the next project for you?\n\nProducing my own movie is not the main thing as it is a regular thing. My main aim is to act in Hollywood.\n\nAre you in any way threatened by the new faces in Nollywood?\n\nNo way. You know Nollywood is like heaven where you have so many stars; none is struggling to be in the other\u2019s spaces, because all of them have their own position and nobody is being threatened by the other.\n\nHow did you meet your husband?\n\nI met my husband while I was in the university; my lecturer introduced me to my husband.\n\nWas it love at first sight?\n\nHmm, we dated for sometime before we got married.\n\nWhat attracted you to him?\n\nHe is a very quiet man.",

          "title": "Anxiety Mounts as Deadline for Buhari to Sign Electoral Bill Expires Today",
          "text": "\u2022SANs ask National Assembly to override Buhari\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja, and Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos\n\nAnxiety has gripped Nigerians over the conduct of future elections as the constitutional time limit for President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 ends today, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the inclusion of direct primaries is one of the major hurdles that may militate against Buhari\u2019s assent.\n\nWhile there are indications that Buhari, who is still in Turkey, may sign the bill and send an amendment to the National Assembly, some senior lawyers have asked the federal lawmakers to override the president.\n\nSection 58(4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) stipulates that where a bill is presented to the president for assent, he shall within 30 days thereof signify that he assents or that he withholds assent.\n\nUnder Section 58(5), the constitution states: \u201cWhere the president withholds his assents and the bill is again passed by each house by a two-thirds majority, the bill shall become law and the assent of the President shall not be required.\u201d\n\nToday, December 19, 2021, is the deadline mandated by the Constitution for the president to sign the electoral bill sent to him for assent on November 19, 2021.\n\nCurrently, the president is on an official state visit to Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nIt was learnt that he might refuse to sign the bill and ask the National Assembly to consider some of the major issues.\n\nA top official at the presidency told THISDAY that the president wants the direct primary imposed on political parties in the new bill removed, based on the advice of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\n\u201cThere is already a Supreme Court judgment that political parties should be allowed to decide their internal affairs. So, the president believes that imposing a direct primary on political parties would amount to imposing a decision on them on the conduct of their affairs,\u201d the source explained.\n\nSome political parties, including the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had kicked against the direct primary and insisted that parties should be allowed to decide the management of their internal affairs democratically.\n\nThe presidency source further explained that Buhari is also concerned with the cost and security implications of direct primary.\n\nIn the letter by the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, to the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed; INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, and the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, dated November 29, 2021, the president had requested their inputs on the cost and security implications of the electoral bill.\n\nThe presidency source told THISDAY that it was based on the IG and the minister\u2019s comments on the cost and security implications of direct primary elections by political parties that Buhari has raised objections against the direct primary.\n\nThe source concluded that since Buhari is expected back in Nigeria from Turkey today, he may be persuaded to sign the bill and send an amendment to areas he had raised objections to.\n\nINEC had on December 3, 2021, replied to Buhari\u2019s letter directing it to explain some issues contained in the electoral bill transmitted to it by the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to the reliable source in the presidency, it was INEC\u2019s considered opinion that the bill contains substantial provisions that would lay a solid foundation for important improvements in the electoral process.\n\nINEC, he said, had highlighted landmark proposals in the bill that would radically improve the quality of elections.\n\nThese include Electronic transmission of results, early submission of list of nominated candidates, and the power of INEC to review election results declared under duress or in contravention of electoral laws and guidelines.\n\nINEC said in its response that \u201can accelerated assent to the bill will facilitate the preparation of major elections such as the FCT municipal area council election, Ekiti and Osun states governorship elections, and the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nIt, therefore, urged the president not to hesitate in signing the bill on electoral reforms.\n\nSANs Ask N\u2019Assembly to Override Buhari\n\nMeanwhile, as the constitutional time limit for Buhari to sign the bill ends today, some senior lawyers yesterday asked the National Assembly to override the decision of the president if he withholds his assent.\n\nThe legal icons, also, faulted a position credited to Malami in a leaked letter to the president that making direct primary mandatory for all political parties would confuse.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that if the National Assembly goes on recess on December 21 as proposed and resumes in the third week of January 2022, the lawmakers may not have the time limit to veto the president.\n\nInterim Chair, Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond (ASCAB), Mr. Femi Falana (SAN); a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Chief Joseph Daudu; human rights lawyer, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa; Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN); constitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN); and Mr. John Baiyeshea (SAN), told THISDAY that the federal lawmakers should veto the president.\n\nWhile INEC and the leadership of the National Assembly had advised the president to sign the bill, most states governors and Malami had asked him to reject the bill on the ground that making direct primary mode mandatory would create confusion among political parties.\n\nWith the constitutional time limit ending today, Falana challenged the National Assembly to proceed to override the decision of the president if he withholds his assent in line with section 58(5) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFalana said if the president withholds assent again as he did in 2018, the lawmakers should initiate the process of overriding the decision of the president, which according to him, required a two-thirds majority of the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nFalana, however, explained that the challenge of the governors \u201cis not direct primary mode. The real problem is the electronic transmission of election results because it will stop manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe governors now want the president to throw away the baby and bathwater. That is how the president rejected it in 2018 under the guise that it was close to the general election.\n\n\u201cThe 2010 Electoral Act provides for direct and indirect primaries specifically under section 87 (1), (2) & (3) of the Act. Under this regime, direct primary mode is optional. In the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021, it becomes mandatory. The question of some leaders sitting somewhere to impose candidates will not arise again.\u201d\n\nOn Malami\u2019s letter, Falana asked the president to ignore misleading advice from unsolicited quarters, especially potential governorship aspirants, noting that such advice \u201cis based on personal interests and not in the national interest.\u201d\n\nThe human rights lawyer also, added that the question of political parties amending their constitutions \u201cto accommodate direct primaries does not arise as they are already part and parcel of the electoral law.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Daudu noted that under the subsisting electoral regime, indirect primaries, direct primaries, and consensus had been identified as the options open to the political parties to select and submit candidates for elections.\n\nHe explained how the overbearing roles of the governors in the entire electoral process compelled the lawmakers and other stakeholders to introduce the direct primary mode during the amendment of the Electoral Act in 2015.\n\nThe senior lawyer argued that over the years, the other stakeholders \u201chave accused the state governors of having a stranglehold on the entire electoral process, especially the process leading to the selection of candidates.\n\nDaudu explained how members of the National Assembly took a collective exception to the stranglehold of the governors on the electoral process considering implications such influence had on their nominations for election.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is understandable, as it was getting increasingly clear that even their re-election to their various seats at the National Assembly was shaky without the endorsement of their respective governors.\n\n\u201cConsequently, like a bolt from the blues, the legislators inserted by legislative fiat, a clause in the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill stipulating that the party flag bearers can only be selected by the direct primary medium or mode by their political parties.\u201d\n\nNBA\u2019s former president said: \u201cThe legislators want to call the shots, and in the process, upstage the governors as to who occupies an electoral office in Nigeria. Thus, it is not about internal democracy, but about who emerges as the winner in 2023.\n\n\u201cHence, this Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill as engineered by the National Assembly who together with some segments of the civil society organisations want to use the new law to shift the power base. Now, it is not Buhari\u2019s duty to weigh in on the side of one of the two combatants.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said the responsibility of the President \u201cis to bequeath on Nigeria an enduring electoral legislation that will enthrone free, fair, and credible elections and not arbitrate between legislators and governors as to who will have the electoral advantage come 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, Adegboruwa told THISDAY that there \u201care many innovative provisions in the bill that makes it attractive as a tool to oil our democratic experiment, especially the issues of electronic transmission of election results and direct primaries for the political parties.\n\n\u201cFrom the events monitored on the floor of the National Assembly and indeed the public hearings conducted, it is clear that Nigerians prefer that results of elections be transmitted electronically by INEC to avoid the recurring decimal of manipulation and rigging.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adegboruwa, direct primaries for the choice of candidates of political parties will eliminate the hydra-headed issues of godfatherism and imposition of candidates.\n\nRelying on section 58 (5) of the 1999 Constitution, the senior lawyer urged the National Assembly, in the national interest, \u201cto invoke their constitutional powers to pass the Electoral Bill and save our democracy from imminent collapse.\u201d\n\nHe added that Nigerians expect the National Assembly to shake off the toga of being a rubber stamp entity and use this golden opportunity to assert their autonomy.\n\n\u201cThis matter is important and pressing enough to warrant the suspension of the current recess of the National Assembly to pass the Bill and in that wise, override presidential assent. Nothing is too much to give to salvage our hard-earned democracy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on whether Saturdays and Sundays are included in the 30 days, Adegboruwa stated that the \u201cConstitution only says 30 days and there is no distinction on 30 working days.\u201d\n\nConstitutional lawyer, Ozekhome, also disclosed that the 30 days will expire today.\n\n\u201cUnder section 58(4-5), it will expire today. By tomorrow, which is Monday, the National Assembly can convene. But we do not have a National Assembly. They are lily-livered. They are spineless. If they are a strong National Assembly, they will convene on Monday and get the two-third majority of the members of the Senate and House of Representatives and override the president\u2019s withholding assent.\n\n\u201cWhat the president has not done now is to veto the bill by assenting to it. But the National Assembly can override it under Section 58(4-5) of the 1999 Constitution. They should go ahead and override the president\u2019s veto.\n\n\u201cI do not agree with the argument of the AGF. Because the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 introduces the direct primary, you should kill the whole Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill? The argument that political parties will have to change their constitutions does not arise at all.\n\n\u201cThe political parties can always change their constitutions. What is the big deal? Is that why you should kill the whole Electoral Act that contains electronic transmission of results, which is a leap forward? That argument is red herring. I think the president should assent to this bill. Since today is Sunday, he should assent to it today. The last day falls on today, which is Sunday. He must assent to it today. If he does not, the National Assembly must meet tomorrow and override the president\u2019s veto. They have that power,\u201d Ozekhome explained.\n\nBut for Mr. Ahmed Raji (SAN), the big question is whether Nigeria as a country can currently afford the huge cost of the Direct Primary being proposed in the amended bill.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, Raji also further questioned the capacity of INEC as well as that of the various political parties to conduct direct primary elections.\n\n\u201cMy frank position is that the National Assembly should holistically and thoroughly examine the reservations of Mr. President. Direct Primary is new and it is looking like a mini general election. Can we afford it? Is INEC well equipped for it? Do the parties have credible members\u2019 registers? And what is the effect on our court system? And is our life all about elections?\u201d he queried.\n\nIn his reaction, Mr. John Baiyeshea (SAN), insisted that if the President does not sign the Electoral Bill, the next thing that should happen is to invoke the Constitutional provisions to override the president\u2019s veto.\n\nThe senior lawyer, however, expressed doubt that the present dispensation of lawmakers has what it takes to override the president.\n\n\u201cEven under the rather \u2018hostile\u2019 leadership of the National Assembly in the immediate past dispensation (is it the 8th Assembly they called it), the president vetoed an Electoral Bill and other Bills. And they did not override him then.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the present rather \u2018friendly\u2019 leadership of the National Assembly galvanising the National Assembly members to override him\u201d, he said.\n\nBut Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN) argued that the result-oriented approach would be that if the President is not persuaded to sign the bill, \u201cboth Houses of the National Assembly have the constitutional mandate or power to take a second and possibly harder look at the Bill.\n\n\u201cOnce they are doubly convinced that the Bill as initially passed would do more good than harm to the polity, it would be proper for the National Assembly to override the veto of the President bypassing the Bill into law with the requisite majority.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "It was learnt that he might refuse to sign the bill and ask the National Assembly to consider some of the major issues.\n\u201cThere is already a Supreme Court judgment that political parties should be allowed to decide their internal affairs.\nThe presidency source further explained that Buhari is also concerned with the cost and security implications of direct primary.\nBecause the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 introduces the direct primary, you should kill the whole Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill?\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the present rather \u2018friendly\u2019 leadership of the National Assembly galvanising the National Assembly members to override him\u201d, he said.",

          "title": "Buhari Rallies International Support against Terrorism",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has called on the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit to provide concrete support to help defeat terrorism and insurgency on the African continent.\n\nThe president who made the call yesterday while speaking at the third edition of the summit in Istanbul Turkey admitted that the Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and degraded by Nigeria\u2019s defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, also yesterday again drew the attention of Buhari to the fact Nigeria is collapsing due to terrorists\u2019 activities.\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed delight that the Summit convened by Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has given due consideration to the issue of terrorism, while also focusing on development and infrastructure in Africa.\n\nThis is coming as Erdogan has stated that Turkey would send 15 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Africa, adding that the low vaccination rates there was a blot on humanity.\n\nBuhari advised that the partnership should also focus on the global challenge of climate change which is impacting Nigeria, Turkey, and indeed the world at large.\n\nAccording to him, it has become a catalyst for conflict through food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe trend is the same around the world where communities are overwhelmed by forest fires, rising sea levels, flood, drought, and desertification. I want to seize this opportunity to appeal for support for initiatives such as Africa\u2019s Great Green Wall on Environment and Land Management, which is designed to fight the effects of climate change and desertification in Africa. The initiative aims to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land in the 11 countries of the Sahel-Sahara strip, capture 250 million tons of carbon and, create 10 million green jobs by 2030.\u201d\n\nOn the global coronavirus pandemic, Buhari urged nations to follow the example of Africa-Turkey cooperation, which emphasises solidarity and support in tackling the challenge.\n\nThe president noted that given the increasingly unpredictable nature of contemporary global challenges facing mankind, world leaders must continue to put the wellbeing of humanity at the centre of the agenda for the common good and prosperity of all.\n\nWhile applauding President Erdogan for initiating the Turkey-Africa Partnership in 2008, Buhari urged the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCTA) to assist in further increasing the level of Africa-Turkey trade, leading to a win-win for all countries.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The pandemic is a global challenge which calls for global solidarity and solutions and the Africa-Turkey cooperation model has proved to be an example to the world. Not only has there been mutual support to respond to the pandemic but also mutual support to build resilience and sustainable development in other sectors. We also commend the African Union for the excellent role it has been playing in coordinating the implementation process of the Partnership.\n\nWe must therefore promote science, technology, and innovation and share knowledge from research and development to better equip us to address present and future challenges more equitably and sustainably.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, Nigeria strongly endorses the Summit Declaration as well as the 2022-2026 Joint Action Plan. We are confident that given the level of openness, trust and commitment manifested in the Africa\u2013Turkey Partnership, this cooperation mechanism will be a game-changer for our countries and set us on the path of sustainable development for our peoples\u201d\n\nNigeria is Collapsing, Ortom Tells Buhari in Birthday Message\n\nMeanwhile, Benue State Governor, Ortom, yesterday again drew Buhari\u2019s attention to the fact Nigeria is collapsing due to the activities of terrorists.\n\nOrtom said the president is a grandfather who should understand that people are dying daily unnecessarily in the hands of terrorists.\n\nIn a message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur, yesterday, to congratulate Buhari on his 79th birthday, the governor was quoted as saying that the insecurity affecting citizens was not what the president promised when he assumed office in 2015.\n\nAccording to the statement, the governor, who said he loves Buhari, urged him to take urgent action to secure the country before he leaves office.\n\nOrtom pleaded with the president to use his 79th birthday, not as a member of a political party or any religious bias, but as a grandfather and a nationalist, to address the obvious imbalances in the nation now before he hands over power in 2023.\n\n\u201cI join your family, friends, political associates, and all Nigerians to congratulate you on the occasion of your 79th birthday,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo some, the president is a father, to others, grandfather while yet to others, he is a great grandfather who should understand that Nigeria at the moment is collapsing due to the activities of terrorists who have continued to destroy the very foundation of the unity of this country.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the security architecture in the country has collapsed and the citizens now live in perpetual fear as strangers in their own country is not acceptable.\n\n\u201cDaily, people are slaughtered like animals either on their farms, at home, or roasted to death while travelling from one destination to another with video clips showing the faces of the killers. Yet, no one has been arrested.\n\n\u201cThe roads have become booby traps where the citizenry are scared to travel on, for the fear that they may be kidnapped for ransom or in some cases killed outrightly. It is an open secret that no one is safe in this country any longer.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the security architecture in the country has collapsed and the citizens now live in fear.\n\n\u201cThe president should not listen to sycophants who may not be telling him the truth that all is well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll is not well with Nigeria right now, Mr. President. You must therefore take urgent steps now to pull the nation back from the precipice before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged every citizen not to sit on the fence but join hands with governments at all levels as patriots to assist in redeeming the nation from the hands of bloodthirsty terrorists so that Nigeria can gradually move into political stability and economic prosperity for all.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Erdogan Pledges 15m COVID-19 Vaccine Doses for Africa\n\nAlso speaking yesterday, at a major summit of the continent\u2019s leaders, President Erdogan said Turkey would send 15 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to Africa, adding that the low vaccination rates there was a blot on humanity.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the global injustice in accessing the Covid-19 vaccine and Africa\u2019s unjust treatment,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\n\u201cIt is disgraceful for humanity that only six per cent of Africa\u2019s population has been vaccinated.\u201d\n\nTurkey is developing its vaccine, known as Turkovac, which is in the process of receiving emergency use approval.\n\nIt was not immediately clear from his remarks whether Turkey would first send some doses of the internationally approved vaccines it was currently using, including those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\n\u201cTo contribute to the resolution of this issue, within our means, we plan to share 15 million vaccine doses in the period ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) has clarified that loans from China to Nigeria, which presently stood at $3.59billion were largely concessional as no national asset was tagged as collateral.\n\nThe Director-General of DMO, Ms Patience Oniha, who made this known in an interview yesterday, also disclosed that the loan constitutes only 9.4 per cent of the country\u2019s total foreign debt stock of $37.9 billion.\n\nIn recent times, both the social and mainstream media have been awash with news about some African countries, including Nigeria, facing the threat of losing some critical national assets to the Asian country due to high-level indebtedness.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s total debt stock as at September 30 was $37.9 billion; this figure comprised the external debt stock of the federal government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cBut total loans from China stands at $3.59 billion, which is 9.47 per cent of the total external debt. The loans did not require any national asset as collateral; they were largely concessional,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha urged Nigerians to always endeavour to verify sensitive information from official sources before disseminating it.\n\nShe explained that before foreign loans were contracted, very sensitive steps were taken by multiple institutions of government to ensure that they were beneficial to the nation.\n\n\u201cBefore any foreign loan is contracted, including the issuance of Eurobond, they are approved by the Federal Executive Council and thereafter, the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAn important and extremely critical step is that the loan agreements are approved by the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cAn opinion is issued by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice before the agreements are signed.\n\n\u201cSeveral measures which operate seamlessly have been put in place to ensure that data on debt are available and that debt is serviced as at when due. Provisions are made explicitly for debt service in the annual budgets,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha explained that the loans agreements provided a number of steps to take to resolve dispute when they arise.\n\n\u201cThe first action is that the parties should resolve it within themselves and if that fails, they go to arbitration.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a lender, in this case, China, would not just pounce on an asset at the first sign of a dispute, including defaults,\u2019\u2019 the she said.\n\nShe explained that the DMO maintained proper records of debts, provided projections for debt service and processed the actual payments for debt service.\n\nShe pointed out that those functions were carried out in conjunction with the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I assure you that I will endorse all their positive recommendations,\u201d he assured Erdogan.\n\nPresident Gets Surprise Birthday Cake in Istanbul\n\nPresident Buhari, at a surprise 79th birthday reception organised for him in Istanbul yesterday promised to advance the interest of Nigerians and that of the nation as he prepares to leave office in May, 2023.\n\nThe President also used the forum to disclose that he was itching to return to his farm in Daura, Katsina State to tend his crops and livestock.\n\nAs he stepped out of his suite, moving to the meeting room, President Buhari met a surprise lineup of the Nigerian delegation with a cake decorated in Nigeria\u2019s national colours.\n\nThe group broke into a chorus, as they began chanting \u201cHappy Birthday, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, who spoke on behalf of the delegation, and the Ambassador of Nigeria to Turkey, Ismail Yusuf Abba, congratulated the President on the good work \u201che is doing for the country\u201d, and wished him a happy birthday, many healthy years ahead and the energy to give his best to the nation.\n\nOnyeama noted, in particular, that the President \u201ccontinues to have a good run with his health, getting better and more active with time.\u201d\n\nResponding to the tribute, Buhari said he would put-in his best for Nigeria until the last day when, in 2023 he hands over to a successor and returns to his farm to tend crops and livestock.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cI thought that being away from Abuja I will escape these things. The Guards Brigade had written to tell me what they wanted to do on this day. Now here you are doing this far away from home.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the year 2023 when I finish, to go home to take charge of my farm.

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their affiliate commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance. Failing cluster managers can\u2019t get additional terminals, and this means their multi-level earnings on their agent network caps. No one wants that. So they\u2019d have to retrieve the non-performing terminals and give them to better agents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our star agents, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our agents tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these agents,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin\n\nA few weeks ago, we started a discussion on The Next Frontier. Since then, we\u2019ve explored The Next Frontier as it relates to edtech and fintech. This week, we\u2019re doing something a bit different.\n\nDrawing from previous discussions, we will look at four future developments in tech and what they could mean for you either as a student, startup founder, entrepreneur, or policymaker.\n\nAI and more data applications in edtech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Pixabay on Pexels\n\nThere have been considerable developments in Africa\u2019s edtech space, from remote learning to self-paced learning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the future, the application of artificial intelligence and proper data management would be groundbreaking. In the case of AI, it would be improving learning efficiency for students and teachers.\n\nOne of the challenges of traditional education is the inability to tailor teaching to the needs of students and AI can help with that through personalised learning.\n\nSo this could mean that while there may be several students in a class, they would all be taught at different levels and tested on different subjects.\n\nThe other development would be in the use of data. As more students use edtech solutions, a lot of data would be gotten that could also help in providing better learning outcomes.\n\nEven more interesting is that these developments would not be beneficial to students alone. Teachers would be able to develop curriculums that draw on the students\u2019 strengths.\n\nRepetitive and administrative tasks would also be cut down or eliminated using AI.\n\nAPI healthtech startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash\n\nThe fintech industry has benefited a great deal from the presence of API fintech startups as they have eased interoperability. The same looks set to be done for the healthtech space.\n\nCurrently, there are no African startups providing healthtech startups with an API. Consequently, data obtained exists in silos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPI startups could, therefore, be a game-changer. Imagine for a moment that you are a patient who has been using a healthtech provider but now needs to switch to another for some reason.\n\nWithout API startups, the process of getting your medical history has to begin afresh, but with an API startup, all that information could be gotten in seconds.\n\nIn addition, healthtech APIs mean that startups no longer have to build all the solutions they need but instead focus on the areas in which they excel.\n\nCompanies investing in companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem matures, one trend that Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO, believes could become commonplace is companies investing in companies.\n\nAlready, we\u2019re seeing some form of it with Interswitch\u2019s investment in Okhi and Flutterwave\u2019s investment in CinetPay.\n\nWhat this would do is help companies consolidate their efforts. So rather than have several companies in a space but only slightly moving the needle, the resources and skills can be combined to go after a larger market.\n\nUsing the fintech industry as an example, it could mean that more financially excluded people get access to financial services.\n\nCompanies investing in companies would also mean that the smaller startup could leverage the assets and experience of the larger startup to build more efficient services and attract other investors.\n\nContactless cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, you will be familiar with contactless cards. You transfer money to it and use it to pay your bus fares.\n\nNow, imagine your financial service provider issuing such a card. You\u2019d no longer be bothered about leaving the house without cash or your ATM card.\n\nYou could pay for groceries or dates without using cash or punching in your ATM card PIN. It is also a safer option for users as it reduces the chances of being robbed. For business owners, it also improves the customer experience while protecting against fraud.\n\nIf you were not aware, The next frontier is also the theme for Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nHolding on January 22, 2022, it will feature startup competitions and exhibitions in addition to conversations on The next frontier. We would love to have you there, so if you have not registered, follow this link to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "A Zimbabwean Data Protection Act to rule them all. Or not",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 3, 2021, Zimbabwe joined the list of African countries that can now boast a data protection law.\n\nLike the second instalment in this series, a tweet spurred this article. This tweet by tweeter, @RangMberi intrigued me for two reasons.\n\nNever having followed the Zimbabwean scene, it was nice to see. However, the tweet\u2019s contents were of more interest to me.\n\nFrom the screenshots Mberi shared, several acts such as revenge pornography, child pornography, and taking pictures of people\u2019s genitalia without their consent have become illegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a data protection act, these were some intriguing provisions.\n\nA walk down memory lane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nBefore the current Act, Zimbabwe\u2019s laws have made provisions \u2014 albeit in a fragmented manner \u2014 for data protection and privacy.\n\nThe Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act dealt more with the collection, protection, and retention of personal information held by public officers. Other laws included the Consumer Protection Act, Census and Statistics Act, and the Interception of Communication Act, among others.\n\nBut this new law has been in the works for a while as well. First gazetted in May 2020 as the Cybercrimes and Data Protection Bill, it has since undergone some changes.\n\nInitially, The Cybercrimes and Data Protection Bill was to cover all things incidental to Cybercrime and Data Protection. Essentially a mash-up of two different but related fields.\n\nBut a lot of people weren\u2019t having that. Transparency International complained that it was a human rights lawsuit waiting to happen \u2014 especially regarding government spying and stifling freedom of speech. Other persons decried the bill as well.\n\nIn July 2020, Joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committees released a report asking that both fields be separated and an independent body be set up, among other recommendations.\n\nAnd it appears Parliament may have listened, somewhat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nThe Data Protection Act, as it is known now, is styled after the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) model law on data protection.\n\nIt provides for most of what you\u2019d expect from a data protection law; things like data rights of the data subject, what personal information is, and what sensitive information is, among others.\n\nIt provides extensively for consent \u2014 very important \u2014 and it introduces the vital issue of representation of infants and persons that are mentally, legally, or physically incapacitated by their parents and guardians.\n\nIt also explains other important provisions and duties of the data controller and processor, which we have touched on in previous articles.\n\nThe Act also establishes a Data Protection Authority (DPA), but this is where it gets a bit tricky. The DPA appointed in this case is an existing authority called the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ).\n\nPOTRAZ is Zimbabwe\u2019s telecommunications sector regulator, already saddled with responsibilities in that regard. Adding this to that is an interesting move, especially considering all of the duties assigned to them under this new law.\n\n\u201cI think they are going to be saddled with too much administrative authority. Because imagine having to handle all these breaches that will come within 48 hours. I don\u2019t know yet how adequately prepared they are for this.\n\n\u201cI tried to put together the duties of the DPA, and I don\u2019t know \u2014 resource-wise \u2014 whether they\u2019d be able to achieve all of that,\u201d Nellie Tiyago, a Zimbabwean lawyer, tells me.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the fact that POTRAZ already has some experience on the data collection and protection front.\n\n\u201cIt should have been because POTRAZ was already collecting data. Because that\u2019s where our telecoms as well fall under in terms of picking up sensitive information. We\u2019ve got the Interception of Communication Act, and I think POTRAZ was in charge of that. The rationale could have been that they already have a lot of data. And it might be easier than starting afresh.\u201d\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee, the new act was renamed the Data Protection Act instead of the Cybercrimes and Data Protection Act.\n\nHowever, after comparing the previous bill and the current Act, I found that it was merely rearranged to have all the parts touching on data protection at the beginning and the chapters touching on cybersecurity at the end.\n\nI worried that this could also create a duplication of laws and expressed this to Tiyago. But she had a differing opinion.\n\n\u201cData and cyber go hand-in-hand. There needed to be something that speaks to the issue of cybersecurity from a data perspective, which is what has been done. And I\u2019m sure [that] when we get the Cybersecurity law we will be able to see whether there\u2019s a duplication. I don\u2019t think that this causes any confusion. It\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the Act does not mention notifying a data subject where there is a breach of their data. So, say Peter, a Zimbabwean who uses a fintech app for sending money, has his data stolen by someone who hacked into the company\u2019s servers, it appears he might never find out that his data has been stolen.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation \u2014 the first comprehensive data protection law \u2014 provides for this. For some reason, Nigeria\u2019s National Data Protection Regulation has no such provision.\n\nThere are also issues of cross-border transfer of information between countries within and outside the SADC.\n\nFor instance, say you are conducting a cross-border transfer of funds, your data is flying over several countries, and the platform you are using has to ensure that the receiving platform has adequate resources in place to protect your data. If it doesn\u2019t, then your data should not be transferred.\n\nTiyango is interested in how this would play out, especially in scenarios where data is transferred to a non-SADC country.\n\nThe tech ecosystem and data protection\n\nAccording to Tiyago, \u201cThe Act aims to create a technology-driven business environment, encourage technological development, and the lawful use of technology.\u201d\n\nFrom what she tells me, companies like electronic communications networks or access providers, data collection and analytics techs, fintechs, mobile service providers, payment platforms, Internet service providers, satellite television service providers, and health services, including laboratories and testing techs, would have to comply.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tumisu on Pixabay\n\nThe Zimbabwean Act is fresh out of the oven and needs time to cool before we can fully dissect all of the possible scenarios that could occur here.\n\nWill POTRAZ be able to handle all of its duties? Will there be a marked difference between the Data Protection Act and a possible Cybercrimes bill? Most of all, how would all of this affect the data rights of Zimbabweans?\n\nThis is a developing story, and we\u2019ll be bringing more on this as we get more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "Nigeria-based logistics company launches HELP, to provide ambulance services with its Uber-like model",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cUber-like platform for ambulances\u201d reechoed in the room, as HELP, an acronym for Health Emergency Linkage Portal, announced the launch of its GPS based mobile application and emergency healthcare hotline on October 5, 2021.\n\nThe healthtech and logistics company is on a mission to provide quality health care emergency services via a mobile application that allows you to order for an ambulance in case of an emergency, or schedule ahead of a medical appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProper and affordable health care is a fundamental human right. Sadly, in most developing countries like Nigeria, good healthcare is a privilege and accessing medical facilities can be an onerous task. The healthcare sector in the country is crippled with challenges like sluggish response to emergency cases, poor health infrastructure, low number of health workers, amongst other limitations. Deji Faborode, Co-founder and CEO of HELP, says this is the gap they are trying to bridge, one step at a time.\n\n\u201cA lot can be done and we\u2019re still scratching the surface of healthcare solutions in Nigeria. Things are not working as they should as a result of misaligned objectives. Our people are scared for their lives, because what happens in the case of a health emergency? Existing emergency structures don\u2019t meet the demand. This is what brought the vision for HELP. One of the gaps we\u2019re hoping to bridge is the hopelessness in emergency situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe goes further to add that the big picture is creating interconnected systems to complement the existing ones, in order to have a fully working and unified body of ambulance service providers.\n\nDeji Faborode (CEO), Yewande Alebiosu (COO), Victor Iwenya (CTO) and Tomiwa Ogunbona (CPO) birthed the idea to leverage technology in enhancing interconnectedness, building a collaborative healthcare ecosystem, and breaking the silos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 23 months later, the HELP journey to improve access to emergency care has kicked off.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe HELP mobile app is currently available for Android users on the Play Store and is soon to be available on the App Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELP website\n\nIndividuals or corporate bodies sign up, create an account, receive an OTP to confirm registration, and can search for and access ambulances nearest to them. There is also a Healthcare facility navigator which serves as a directory of hospitals and pharmacies closest to the user\u2019s geographical location.\n\nThere are two levels of external partners at HELP, Service Partners and Client Partners. Service partners on the HELP platform include hospitals, health facilities, and private ambulance owners in the country. Client partners include Health Maintenance Organisations(HMO) and Corporate organisations who enroll their members.\n\nThe Client partners\u2019 subscription plan comes in three tiers, Gold, Silver and Bronze. Each varies with the size of the ambulance being ordered and the equipment available for the service needed. Every ambulance type has a base price but prices vary based on distance covered and time spent.\n\nEach user has a unique wallet on the app created for making payments. This cuts out the hurdle of having to re-enter financial information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe HELP app has a feature that allows you to fill in the details of the emergency, to provide adequate information to the paramedics present in the ambulance. The HELP app comes with a feature that allows one to share details like driver\u2019s information, trip history, and the hospital sending the ambulance, with their loved ones. Due to the geo mapping system integrated on the app, routes taken can be tracked and recorded.\n\nBeyond an application, HELP has a hotline, 0-700-HELPSTATION, for cases where there is inability to access mobile networks in an emergency situation. Interestingly, a random person can access the HELP service with the code.\n\nAs the floor opened for comments, some members of the audience shared stories of having lost loved ones as a result of delayed responses to emergency calls and lack of medical assistance in crisis situations. These problems reflect the pillars of quick response, accessibility and coordination that HELP is looking to run on.\n\nOn plans for investments and expansion, Faborode shares that as much as the startup is open to social grants and funding, the key focus at the moment is gaining traction, spreading the word and above all, providing excellent service to users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "title": "2021 IN REVIEW: Political will drag Nigeria\u2019s energy gains in 2021",
          "text": "The year 2021 was predicted to herald a return to normalcy marked by oil price recovery, accelerated push towards energy transition and bold reforms that will transform Nigeria\u2019s floundering oil sector, but the absence of political will rained on planned reforms.\n\nIn 2021, the Nigerian government enacted a new oil sector law, restarted bid rounds for marginal oil fields after an 18-year hiatus, bumped up electricity tariffs, ordered a decade of gas and shepherded new, smaller refineries on stream but a large chunk of these feats were not fully implemented.\n\nIt was also the year Nigeria confronted headlong the reality of its perverse petrol subsidy regime, but the Buhari-led government could not muster enough courage to end it.\n\nThe oil sector, reeling from lockdowns to restrain a rampaging pathogen, witnessed contraction for six straight quarters, the most recent being by 10.73 percent in the third quarter of 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), but oil still accounts for the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s exports.\n\nAnalysts say the most consequential event in the sector this year was the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill into law (now Petroleum Industry Act) after a 20-year wait. \u201cIt brought certainty and investors can evaluate its impacts on the existing and future investments,\u201d notes Chiwendu Enechi, associate director, oil, gas and power at Anderson.\n\nAyodele Oni, energy lawyer and partner at Bloomfield law firm, says the PIA while allowing for some certainty for investors, \u201chas been quite controversial but overall, a very good step considering the age of the Petroleum Act and its inadequacy in modern times.\u201d\n\nThe PIA set new fiscal and regulatory terms, revamped the structure of the state-oil firm, created new rules for administering the sector but failed to acknowledge the reality of energy transition and did not fix gas pricing hurdles to investments.\n\nThe PIA also provided that 30 percent of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (NNPC) profits would fund exploration in frontier basins, allocated 3 percent of oil companies\u2019 capital expenditure to host communities and demolished government structures that aided subsidies. The government it seemed have been walking back the policy pushing deadlines for implementation up to year.\n\nRead also: Seven takeaways from Seplat Energy\u2019s 9-month results\n\nLocal oil firms such as A.A Rano, Petrogas, among others, were awarded marginal oil fields in the first bid round since 2003. The process started in June last year, when over 600 companies applied for 57 marginal fields that span across land, swamp and offshore areas. Unlike previous rounds, gas was the priority rather than oil, this time around.\n\nHowever, the bids were not without wrinkles. Some bidders were unable to raise the financing to pay the pricey signature bonus, which ranges from $5 million to $20 million. Also, the erstwhile regulator, the Department of Petroleum Resources, revoked and re-awarded some undeveloped fields previously awarded leading to legal suits. The government had planned to raise $500 million from the project; available evidence indicates it did not come close.\n\nIn 2021, the world\u2019s biggest single-train refinery being built by Africa\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote, inched closer to completion. The Federal Government also awarded contracts to rehabilitate Kaduna, Warri and Port Harcourt refineries at a cost of $2.9 billion.\n\nAccording to Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, the logic is to revamp the refineries to make them attractive to investors who would operate them for a fee. While the move is to appease labour groups who insist on the creaking refineries working before subsidy is removed, it is yet to be seen if this would work.\n\nNigeria declared a decade of gas in January and six months later reported that its proven natural gas reserves have risen to 206.53 Trillion Cubic Feet (tcf) up from 203.16 tcf. The Federal Government\u2019s gas expansion programme spurred investors into the space and saw a flurry of deals, including NLNG gas supply agreement with three local power firms in June.\n\nIn 2021, petrol subsidies became a national nightmare when the NNPC said it could no longer fund FAAC allocations to meet up with the rising payment. Oil smugglers had a free rein when petrol consumption rose to 100 million litres per day and subsidy bill surpassed $250 million monthly. The government proposed paying 40 million poor people N5,000 monthly to convince labour groups not to shut down the economy when it removes the policy next year.\n\nRising oil prices have forced OPEC and its allies to impose an output cap since 2016, and this was maintained in 2021. Nigeria\u2019s new quota is 1.683 million bpd for January, but it has struggled to meet previous lower quotas in 2021.\n\nIn the downstream sector, tanker drivers and oil workers delivered their regular strike threats in reaction to government policies. Cooking gas prices went through the roof as natural gas prices rose in Europe and the Nigerian government introduced VAT for the commodity.\n\nSome key deals were announced, including the acquisition of majority shares in Eterna plc by Rainoil and the recent purchase of Enyo by Ardova after it rebranded from Forte Oil in February.\n\nThis same year, the NNPC published its audited financial statements which showed how the corporation manicured its book to arrive at a N287 billion profit. Heirs Holdings expanded its oil and gas portfolio with the acquisition of 45 percent of OML 17 from Shell Nigeria in January. Shell and other IOCs began talks to sell-off their onshore and shallow water assets.\n\nIn November, an oil spill at the Santa Barbara oil field, OML 29, located in Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa State attracted global attention. Earlier in February, a Dutch Court in the Hague had found Shell liable for spills in Nigeria.\n\nPower sector challenges continue\n\nIn the power sector, old troubles persisted with the power grid collapsing half a dozen times. The Federal Government/Siemens project that aims to modernise the creaking grid to reduce losses commenced in 2021, and the power sector regulator, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), tried to consolidate on the gains of an earlier increase in 2020 but ran into an impasse with labour leaders.\n\nThe government then promised Nigerians 6 million free meters, which only complicated the Meter Asset Programme aimed at delivering meters to customers by third party investors. However, in February, the World Bank approved $500 million to support Nigeria in improving operations of electricity distribution companies (DisCos).\n\nThe lacklustre minister, Sale Mamman, was fired and Muazu Sambo was nominated in his stead. A glimmer of hope rose for the $5.8 billion Mambilla project when Sunrise Power Transmission Company agreed to out-of-court settlement for the billion dollar contract breach suit it filed at the International Court of Arbitration in France against the Federal Government.\n\nFollowing the re-award of the contract to Chinese firm Sinohydro Corporation Limited, Sunrise Power filed breach of contract claims seeking $2.354 billion.\n\nThe Lagos State government draw up plans for its own power market, an autonomous regulatory agency that will license participants to undertake market monitoring and ensure that prices charged by market participants are cost-reflective and fair to end-users.\n\nThe renewable energy space saw a flurry of new investments from private investors and multilateral organisations. All On, Odyssey Energy Solutions and the recently launched Global Alliance for People and Planet (The Alliance), a global aggregated procurement programme for renewable energy companies, supported by a $10 million Financing Facility in Nigeria.\n\nMany early stage entrepreneurs received millions of naira worth of investments by All On, Bank of Industry, the Rural Electrification Agencies and the African Development Bank, and some federal universities were powered by solar from the proceeds of Nigeria\u2019s green bonds.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s pension industry will see increased competition in service delivery and returns on investment after the ongoing recapitalisation of the sector with new investors taking position.\n\nIndustry analysts are anticipating more mergers and acquisitions, likely to intensify in the first quarter of 2022, when the recapitalisation exercise started in April 2021 would be ending.\n\nAt the last count, a new investor, Tangerine Group, has come into the sector, merging with APT Pensions, having acquired AXA Mansard Pensions earlier, while GTB Holdings has acquired Investment One Pensions, and FCMB has acquired AIICO Pensions, confirms Ehimeme Ohioma, head of surveillance at the National Pension Commission (PenCom).\n\nThis is as 11 Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs), out of the 22 registered operators, are said to have met the capital requirement ahead of next year\u2019s recapitalisation deadline.\n\nOhioma, commenting on the ongoing recapitalisation exercise, says the ongoing capital phase in the industry has attracted new investors, which no doubt will make the sector highly competitive.\n\nAccording to Ohioma, the success of the exercise will climax before the deadline in the first quarter next year, as more mergers and acquisitions are expected.\n\nHe notes that the present capital raise approved by the PenCom board in April 2021 is the third of such since the coming on board of the Contributory Pension Scheme through the Pension Reform Act 2004.\n\nThe first, according to him, was the N150 million capital base in the repealed Pension Reform Act 2004, followed by the second recapitalisation to N1 billion in 2011, and now, the third from N1 billion to N5 billion now.\n\nOhioma states that the objective of the recapitalisation is to improve the financial stability and operational efficiency in the industry, noting that the directive was right, as it could not have come at a better time than now after the last exercise in 2011.\n\nIt is obvious that the industry has grown in assets and contributions have increased, so there is a need for increased working capital.\n\nThe new capital will help retain the skilled workers, he says, saying, \u201cWe need to attract talent. There is a need for digitalisation and ensuring efficiency, especially with the COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOn or before February 2022, we expect a picture of what the industry is going to look like before the April deadline.\u201d\n\nAccording to PenCom\u2019s first quarter 2021 report, approval has been given for the acquisition of AXA Mansard Pensions Limited by Eustacia Limited and the change of name from AXA Mansard Pensions Limited to Tangerine Pensions Limited.\n\nRead also: Competition grows in pension sector as new investors take positions\n\nIn addition, the Commission granted \u201cNo Objection\u201d for the merger between Tangerine Pensions Limited and APT Pension Funds Managers Limited, while FCMB Pensions Limited, one of the subsidiaries of the First City Monument Bank Group plc, also acquired a 60 percent stake in AIICO Pension Managers Limited.\n\nPenCom had on April 27, 2021, mandated PFAs operating in the country to increase their Minimum Regulatory Capital (shareholders\u2019 fund) requirements to N5 billion from N1 billion, giving them 12 months to complete the exercise.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, total pension assets under management rose to N13.001 trillion from N12.901 trillion at the end of August 2021, while registered contributors increased to 9.461 million in September.\n\nThe industry has grown at an impressive CAGR of 18 percent over the last five years, culminating in an asset base of N12.3 trillion, equal to $29.9 billion as December 31, 2020.\n\nThis is according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA) and the Pension Fund Operators Association of Nigeria (PenOp) first ever report on Nigerian Pension funds engagement with private equity released recently, which incorporated responses from Nigeria\u2019s leading pension fund managers.\n\nAisha Dahir-Umar, director-general, PenCom, says the maintenance of a consistent growth trajectory continues to justify the Commission\u2019s overriding investment philosophy of ensuring the safety of pension fund assets.",

          "title": "Kuda, V Banks threaten DMBs domination",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nThe innovative and aggressive drive deployed by Kuda Bank and other challenger banks operating in the country to attract customers and build deposits is gradually breaking down the hold held by Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) on the nation\u2019s retail banking space, Business Hallmark findings can reveal.\n\nSome of the challenger banks giving the DMBs a run for their money are Kuda Bank Sparkle Bank, V FD Bank, Eyowo and Rubies Digital Bank.\n\nWhile the 25 DMBs still have significant headroom in terms of deposits and the ability to sustain their growth, available data indicate they are finding it difficult to starve off the challenger banks encroachment into their territories.\n\nIn the first 9 months of 2021, deposits held in ten largest DMBs totaled N34.4 trillion. Access Bank retained its position as the bank with the largest customer deposit in Nigeria with N6.2 trillion, followed closely by UBA N6.08 trillion and Zenith Bank N6.04 trillion.\n\nDespite their impressive showing, challenger banks, particularly Kuda Bank, have made significant inroads into the retail banking space as they offer incentives to younger Nigerians to abandon the more traditional banks.\n\nWhile not averse to taking on board old and conservative minded customers, the new banks focus majorly on technology obsessed younger generation made up of students, young graduates, young and urbane workers as well as burgeoning entrepreneurs.\n\nFor instance, Kuda Bank with over 1.4million customers, reported $2.2billion (almost a trillion naira) in transactions processed in February 2021 alone. This, according to the bank, includes inflows and outflows, airtime purchases, and other user transactions.\n\nThe bank was able to achieve this by delivering superb digital products through IT and mobile applications. Its free debit card, 25 free transfers every month, budgeting tools, overdrafts, 15% annual interest on savings and the possibility to connect account to Payoneer have continued to attract customers to the bank as ant is attracted to honey.\n\nPerhaps the bank\u2019s greatest strength is the development of an application that allows customers to send money without having an account number. Using a payment link, such customer can send transfers more faster to anyone who has a smartphone.\n\nSome of the bank\u2019s customers who spoke with BH, said apart from getting the best banking services without needing to visit a banking hall, they also claimed they favour Kuda as they have been banking with it without incurring excessive charges unlike in traditional banks.\n\n\u201cEvery month, I enjoy 25 free transfers to other banks each and I am able to save around N15,000 yearly\u201d, said Abiodun Olajide, a student of Lagos State University (LASU) who operates an account with the bank.\n\nAnother challenger bank that is giving the traditional banks a run for their money is Sparkle Bank. Established by Uzoma Dozie, the former chief executive officer of the defunct Diamond Bank, the bank, since its launch in 2019, has handled more than $16 million in transactions.\n\nIt also has over 30,000 customers with over N500 million in deposits. The bank offers its esteemed customers personal and business accounts, with account opening taking only five minutes from a smartphone.\n\nA customer earns 3.75% per annum interest rates if he keeps a minimum amount of \u20a6100,000 in his Sparkle wallet.\n\nVBank, also known as V by VFD, is a digital bank that offers different products to individuals and businesses, from instant loans, cardless withdrawals and fixed savings.\n\nThe bank is the pick of many Nigerians, particularly the youths because it charges nothing on transactions and account maintenance, while offering its customers monthly interest on their savings.\n\nThe icing on the cake that entices customers to the bank is its prime product, Veelage. Users earn between N30,000 and N2million monthly by sharing a referral code with their network. The more accounts use the code, the higher customers earnings.\n\nLike Kuda Bank which pays 15 interest on savings (fixed), Vbank also has one of the best interest rates on a fixed account in the country with up to 14% interest paid on the deposits.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a mouthwatering offer like this, while risk putting my funds in very volatile businesses like cryptocurrencies, MMMs and unreliable forex trading,\u201d a risk averse youth based in Lagos, Rufus Olamilekan, enthused.\n\nCustomers of the bank are also adopting the V Target Savings option which make the bank to match 20% of their first contribution towards the desired target amount. The savings account package offers a mouthwatering 8% compounded interest per annum.\n\nA major factor that has helped the challenger banks to take on the more entrenched and dominant market leaders, is the expansion in mobile phone penetration.\n\nTraditional banks, however, are not allowing the challenger banks to take over their market without offering a fight. Using the same weapon the challengers deployed against them \u2013 technology -, DMBs have upgraded their mobile applications with features that can compete favourably with their tech savvy rival\u2019s banking applications.\n\nSimilarly, they have also taped fully into their biggest strength of mobilising funds from risk aversed government ministries, agencies and parastatals, fund managers, multinationals and big corporations, manufacturers, SMEs, and wealthy individuals.\n\nA traditional bank that is matching the new digital banks, technology for technology, is WEMA. The bank has been able to play a major part in the digital banking revolution through its innovative ALAT product.\n\nThe product comes with a full package of current account, savings account with 10% annual interest, instant loans, free virtual dollar card and corporate banking.\n\nSigning up for an ALAT account takes a few minutes. A customer basically needed his or her full names, address, phone number and BVN for an account to be opened and operable.\n\nWEMA Bank\u2019s savings account and Savings Goal offers about three times more than what other conventional banks offer. For instance, an automated savings plan earns 10% annual interest.\n\nCustomers using ALAT also have access to a free virtual dollar card with which they can convert their naira to dollars and make payments or purchase products any time they like.\n\nAnother factor driving younger customers to the digital banks is curiosity. Most youths, BH learnt, are and excited about the opportunities presented to explore and earn more money for themselves.\n\nFor instance, many Nigerian youths used the platform of the new banks to trade in cryptocurrencies before the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN wielded the big stick against cryptocurrencies, as well as individuals and firms dealing in it.\n\nKuda\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO), Ryan Laubscher, said his firm\u2019s plan is to bank not only Nigerians, but every African on the planet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do that by blowing customers away with unparalleled service,\u201d Laubscher boasted.\n\nTo be able to do that, Kuda Bank recently raised $55 million through its London entity. The Series B funding has a valuation of $500million.\n\nA financial expert based in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Dr. advised Banjo Ilori, advised players in the retail banking market not to waste time worrying over the incursion of the new banks into the retail banking market.\n\n\u201cTo have a chance of having a piece of this massive deposit mine, challenger banks embark on a massive expansion of the operations. But presently, the don\u2019t have the muscle to do that.\n\n\u201cThe best they can do now is to continue to bite into the cake (deposits) bit by bit.\n\n\u201cBut my candid opinion is that the banks should not waste unnecessary time worrying over the incursion of the new banks into the retail banking market.\n\n\u201cThere is still a large room considering that bank deposits to GDP is still under 20% in the country,\u201d Ilori stated.",

          "title": "5G spectrum auction; Stakeholders decry cost",
          "text": "By EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), on Monday (December 113) recorded a major advancement in its journey towards deploying the Fifth Generation (5G) network in Nigeria, with two firms acquiring 5G spectrum for $547m after a live auction.\n\nBut there are mounting concerns that the cost implication of obtaining the spectrum, which is far beyond the reserve price (RP) of $197.4m per slot, will make it very difficult for the winners to roll out as they would have spent way above their budget for the deployment of 5G technology across the nation.\n\nStakeholders are of the view that although all the operators will eventually get 5G, those that get the spectrum first might be encumbered with recovering cost rather than focusing on network rollout, which might slow them down.\n\nThe commission\u2019s auction for its two available lots of 100 MHz TDD slots of 3.5 GHz band for the deployment of 5G network had been won by MTN Nigeria and Mafab Nigeria Communications Limited.\n\nThere are five major mobile licensees in Nigeria, namely Airtel Networks Limited, Emerging Markets Telecommunications Services Limited (trading as 9Mobile), Globacom Limited, NATCOMS Development Investment Limited (trading as Ntel), and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc. There are also other service providers offering fixed and wireless broadband services in the country.\n\nThe NCC had approved MTN Nigeria, Mafab and Airtel for the bidding process. The three companies participated in the 5G auction and the bidding began at $199.37m, as against the reserve price of $197.4m set by the NCC.\n\nAfter about eight hours and 11 rounds of bidding, the auction ended at $273.6m for each available lot, and MTN and Mafab emerged as winners. Bidding was set at $275,904,886 for the 11th round. Airtel remained in the bidding process until the last round when it fell off.\n\nMTN paid an extra sum of $15.9m to be assigned Lot One, the preferred lot, while Mafab was assigned Lot Two, at no extra cost. In its Information Memorandum, the commission had said it was auctioning two lots of 100 MHz each in the 3.5 GHz band ranging from 3500 \u2013 3600 MHz and 3700 to 3800 MHz.\n\nThe NCC had explained that each slot of the 5G spectrum was going for an exact price of N75 billion, but added that in an auction, it can go for as high as N100 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of Mafab from nowhere to clinch a slot is a big surprise to some observers. An online platform has linked the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) with the company, a claim NCC has debunked.\n\nCost Concerns\n\nBefore the auction, MTN, Airtel, including the Global System for Mobile telecommunications Association (GSMA) wanted the fees reviewed.\n\nMTN posited that the Reserved Price, RP, is 136 per cent higher than the market value. It recommended that the price should be reviewed downward to about $50 million to ensure full participation of more players.\n\nAirtel, in its submission, wanted the RP reduced to reflect the economic situation in the country. It also claimed that the two slots of 100MHz to be auctioned should be increased to ensure more participation.\n\nGSMA supporting other operators, stressed that NCC should make all slots in 3.5GHz available.\n\nAnalysts rank the RP bid of $194.7 million (N75 billion) among the costliest in the world, topping prices from nations like India and South Africa.\n\nThey had expressed worries that going by the RP, only two operators, especially those with the financial war chest would be able to bid, thereby leaving many interested parties out. But NCC, at a stakeholders\u2019 forum on the 3.5GHz spectrum in Lagos, disclosed that it arrived at the spectrum price by observing global best practices.\n\nAt the forum, the Chairman, Association of Licensed Telecom Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) Gbenga Adebayo, had expressed concern that the price came a bit high for the operators, considering the huge investments they needed to make to ensure a robust 5G rollout in the country.\n\nAdebayo believes that the best government should have done was to make the spectrum license as affordable as possible, so the country could maximize all the potentialities of 5G technology when rolled out.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me say that the telcos will do everything possible to support the government to see out a successful auctioning and a smooth 5G rollout in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, our concern is on the reserved price for the auction. That is where the issue is and that is where all the stakeholders should look into.\u201d\n\nPresident, Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) Ikechukwu Nnamani admitted that Nigeria should not be left behind as far as emerging technologies are concerned, but \u201creduced spectrum cost would help operators to deliver 5G service to subscribers at an affordable rate.\u201d\n\nNnamani, who acknowledged that 5G deployment is far more capital intensive than 4G and other lower technologies, recalled that the Nigerian Senate had during a recent public hearing on the technology, expressed concern that the operators might pass the cost to subscribers.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the operators are going to spend a lot of money to deploy 5G and they will need to recoup their investments from the service. The only way the cost can be lowered for the subscriber is for the telecoms regulator to make the 5G spectrum\u2019s cost as low as possible, he said.\n\nEfforts to get Nnamani comment on the outcome of the auction as at the time of filing this report were fruitless.\n\nHowever, immediate past President of ATCON, Mr. OlusolaTeniola, told our correspondent in a telephone interview that the cost of acquiring the spectrum is far more than what it should be if the goal of harnessing the full potential of the 5G network in the country is to be achieved.\n\n\u201cWhen you add it to the fact that the entire 5G thing is highly capital intensive, you can see that it will not only delay the process, it will also make it accessible only to high net worth individuals and corporate organizations,\u201d Teniola said.\n\n\u201cThe gadget (handset) for the accessing of the 5G is about N5,000 and N7,000. How many Nigerians can afford that?\n\n\u201cMTN already has 4G; transiting to 5G may not cost it as much as it will cost those who do not have 4G. So, in all, the high cost of spectrum slot will make the service so expensive because the investors will like to recoup their money.\n\n\u201cWhat NCC should have done to facilitate the process is to make the slot as affordable as possible to all the bidding firms.\u201d\n\nMore Revenue for Government\n\nBut to further strengthen its case for the viability of the project, the NCC stated that Nigeria would raise a total sum of N300 billion from the auction of the 5G Spectrum next year.\n\n\u201cThe exact price for the spectrum auction in 2022 will give the federal government N300 billion. When the projected revenue is added to it, we are expecting well over N600 billion because it is an auction,\u201d NCC\u2019s Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, had stated during a budget defence session before the National Assembly\u2019s joint committee on communications.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, the N632 billion targeted revenue will comprise expected proceeds from 5G spectrum auction.\n\n\u201cEach slot of the 5G spectrum is going for an exact price of N75 billion. However, in an auction it can go as high as N100 billion.\n\n\u201cThe exact price for the spectrum auction in 2022 will give the federal government N300bn. When the projected revenue is added to it, we are expecting well over N600 billion because it is an auction.\n\n\u201cOur revenue in 2022 will be higher than what is being generated in 2021, which as at the end of September was about N315 billion.\n\nChecks on global deployment of the technology showed that in the USA, Verizon (ticker: VZ) spent $45.5 billion of the total haul, followed by $23.4 billion by AT&T (T) and $9.3 billion by T-Mobile US (TMUS).\n\nIt will cost the winning bidders another $14 billion to clear the spectrum for use by wireless companies. Satellite companies such as the bankrupt Intelsat currently occupy it.\n\nThe auction, which was conducted by the Federal Communications Commission\u2014began on December 8, 2020 with bidding ending in January. It included two categories of licenses, which will become available in late 2021 and late 2023.\n\nThe auction in Brazil started on November 4, with expectations that it will raise around 10 billion reais ($1.87 billion) based on the minimum bids allowed.\n\nThe winning bidders will be required to invest about 40 billion reais in 5G infrastructure, the government predicts, with the level of capital expenditure also considered as part of the bid value.\n\nIn the UK, the bidding process concluded earlier in March raised \u00a31.36 billion for the 200 MHz of spectrum on offer, exceeding the \u00a31.1 billion reserve price set by Ofcom.",

          "title": "PDP calls out APC on alleged connection with killings, demands Buhari visits troubled areas",
          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC), has been fiercely criticised by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for its unforgivable indifference to terrorist assaults in Sokoto, Niger, Katsina, Kaduna, Plateau, and other parts of the country.\n\nThe apparent numbness of the APC leaders to bloodshed, as well as the failure of the APC as a party to offer any tangible solution or forcefully call its government to task on security, validates concerns about the APC\u2019s reported complicity in our nation\u2019s worsening insecurity over the last six years, the PDP said in a statement released on Sunday and signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIs it not unforgivable that, while the APC failed to show empathy for the heinous murder of scores of travelers who were burned alive in Sokoto state, the massacre of over 15 worshippers in Niger state, and other compatriots killed in Kaduna, Katsina, and other parts of the country in recent days, its leaders and officials in government found time to attend President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s son\u2019s turbaning ceremony in the same troubled Katsina state?\n\n\u201cIs it also not provocative, vexatious and indeed the height of heartlessness that APC and its leaders party while Nigeria burns?\n\n\u201cSuch callous assault on the sensibility of Nigerians which amounts to dancing on the graves of the victims of the attacks further exposes the APC as a party that is completely unfeeling to killings, attaches no value to lives and has no commitment towards the fight against terrorism in our country.\n\n\u201cThe PDP, standing in solidarity with Nigerians, calls out the APC to come clean on its alleged connection to killings, the benefit it derives from violence and bloodletting and why it attaches no value to human lives.\n\n\u201cNigerians can recall that despite demands by the PDP, the APC and its leaders have failed to account for the \u201cpolitical mercenaries\u201d they reportedly imported from neighboring countries as thugs, gangsters and hoodlums to unleash violence on Nigerians during the 2019 elections. The APC has also not explained the continued presence of a self-confessed terrorism apologist in its government.\n\n\u201cThe least Nigerians expect of the APC is to forcefully give its government a marching order to develop wholesome strategy to proactively tackle insecurity, including targeting the source of fund to terrorists, many of which were revealed by a foreign government, yet the APC government refused to take action.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the APC as a party of selfish and blood thirsty \u201cpolitical bandits\u201d does not have the commitment, readiness or capacity to do so.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the PDP charges President Muhammadu Buhari to demonstrate leadership and empathy by personally visiting the troubled states in line with his campaign promise to lead the fight against terrorism from the front instead of always pushing his responsibilities to others.\n\nThe PDP again commiserates with victims of the horrific attacks. We also urge Nigerians not to resign to despondency but continue to support one another and remain focused as we scale up our collective efforts to rescue and rebuild our nation from misrule.\u201d",

          "text": "The Debt Management Office (DMO) has clarified that loans from China to Nigeria, which presently stood at $3.59billion were largely concessional as no national asset was tagged as collateral.\n\nThe Director-General of DMO, Ms Patience Oniha, who made this known in an interview om Saturday, also disclosed that the loan constitutes only 9.4 per cent of the country\u2019s total foreign debt stock of $37.9 billion.\n\nIn recent times, both the social and mainstream media have been awash with news about some African countries, including Nigeria, facing the threat of losing some critical national assets to the Asian country due to high-level indebtedness.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s total debt stock as at September 30 was $37.9 billion; this figure comprised the external debt stock of the federal government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cBut total loans from China stands at $3.59 billion, which is 9.47 per cent of the total external debt. The loans did not require any national asset as collateral; they were largely concessional,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha urged Nigerians to always endeavour to verify sensitive information from official sources before disseminating it.\n\nShe explained that before foreign loans were contracted, very sensitive steps were taken by multiple institutions of government to ensure that they were beneficial to the nation.\n\n\u201cBefore any foreign loan is contracted, including the issuance of Eurobond, they are approved by the Federal Executive Council and thereafter, the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAn important and extremely critical step is that the loan agreements are approved by the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cAn opinion is issued by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice before the agreements are signed.\n\n\u201cSeveral measures which operate seamlessly have been put in place to ensure that data on debt are available and that debt is serviced as at when due. Provisions are made explicitly for debt service in the annual budgets,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha explained that the loans agreements provided a number of steps to take to resolve dispute when they arise.\n\n\u201cThe first action is that the parties should resolve it within themselves and if that fails, they go to arbitration.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a lender, in this case, China, would not just pounce on an asset at the first sign of a dispute, including defaults,\u2019\u2019 the she said.\n\nShe explained that the DMO maintained proper records of debts, provided projections for debt service and processed the actual payments for debt service.\n\nShe pointed out that those functions were carried out in conjunction with the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nFestus Akanbi",

Yet, no one has been arrested.\n\n\u201cThe roads have become booby traps where the citizenry are scared to travel on, for the fear that they may be kidnapped for ransom or in some cases killed outrightly. It is an open secret that no one is safe in this country any longer.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the security architecture in the country has collapsed and the citizens now live in fear.\n\n\u201cThe president should not listen to sycophants who may not be telling him the truth that all is well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll is not well with Nigeria right now, Mr. President. You must therefore take urgent steps now to pull the nation back from the precipice before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged every citizen not to sit on the fence but join hands with governments at all levels as patriots to assist in redeeming the nation from the hands of bloodthirsty terrorists so that Nigeria can gradually move into political stability and economic prosperity for all.\n\nEditor",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has called on the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit to provide concrete support to help defeat terrorism and insurgency on the African continent.\n\nThe president who made the call while speaking at the third edition of the summit in Istanbul, Turkey, on Saturday admitted that the Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and degraded by Nigeria\u2019s defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, also on Saturday again drew the attention of Buhari to the fact Nigeria is collapsing due to terrorists\u2019 activities.\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed delight that the Summit convened by Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has given due consideration to the issue of terrorism, while also focusing on development and infrastructure in Africa.\n\nThis is coming as Erdogan has stated that Turkey would send 15 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Africa, adding that the low vaccination rates there was a blot on humanity.\n\nBuhari advised that the partnership should also focus on the global challenge of climate change which is impacting Nigeria, Turkey, and indeed the world at large.\n\nAccording to him, it has become a catalyst for conflict through food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe trend is the same around the world where communities are overwhelmed by forest fires, rising sea levels, flood, drought, and desertification. I want to seize this opportunity to appeal for support for initiatives such as Africa\u2019s Great Green Wall on Environment and Land Management, which is designed to fight the effects of climate change and desertification in Africa. The initiative aims to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land in the 11 countries of the Sahel-Sahara strip, capture 250 million tons of carbon and, create 10 million green jobs by 2030.\u201d\n\nOn the global coronavirus pandemic, Buhari urged nations to follow the example of Africa-Turkey cooperation, which emphasises solidarity and support in tackling the challenge.\n\nThe president noted that given the increasingly unpredictable nature of contemporary global challenges facing mankind, world leaders must continue to put the wellbeing of humanity at the centre of the agenda for the common good and prosperity of all.\n\nWhile applauding President Erdogan for initiating the Turkey-Africa Partnership in 2008, Buhari urged the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCTA) to assist in further increasing the level of Africa-Turkey trade, leading to a win-win for all countries.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The pandemic is a global challenge which calls for global solidarity and solutions and the Africa-Turkey cooperation model has proved to be an example to the world. Not only has there been mutual support to respond to the pandemic but also mutual support to build resilience and sustainable development in other sectors. We also commend the African Union for the excellent role it has been playing in coordinating the implementation process of the Partnership. We must therefore promote science, technology, and innovation and share knowledge from research and development to better equip us to address present and future challenges more equitably and sustainably.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, Nigeria strongly endorses the Summit Declaration as well as the 2022-2026 Joint Action Plan. We are confident that given the level of openness, trust and commitment manifested in the Africa\u2013Turkey Partnership, this cooperation mechanism will be a game-changer for our countries and set us on the path of sustainable development for our peoples\u201d\n\nDejo Elumoye",
