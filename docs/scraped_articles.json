          "text": "The Director, Child Welfare, Gombe State Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, Joseph Markus, has lamented the increase of underaged girls for cheap labour on the farmlands.\n\nMarkus made this revelation in his address on Tuesday, at a media roundtable organised by Save the Children International towards ending child marriage in the state.\n\nAccording to the Director, the situation is gaining momentum across the state, stressing that certain privileges he enjoys as a person came through education.\n\nHe urged stakeholders to ensure that issues concerning the girl child are given deserved priority.\n\nMarkus said, \u201cAs we were coming from Kumo this morning with the speaker (children\u2019s parliament), I saw groups of girls waiting for those that will come and hire them, take them to the farms to work for the whole day from morning to night.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t we be kind to them, can\u2019t we provide support for them. I told the speaker, speaker see your people. We have been agitating, advocating those in government as well as the legislators to help us pass this legal framework so that we will have something to lean on. So that we can fight this fight.\n\n\u201cAt the moment I can shake hands with the governor, dine with him because I have gone to school but for school. Education is a tool.\u201d\n\nMarkus also reminded relevant stakeholders to ensure the domestication of the Child Rights Act, as well as the implementation of a framework towards ending child marriage in the state.\n\n\u201cThe question is are the lawmakers seeing the young as they are used for labour. Just last week a four-year-old was defiled; the question is if she was my daughter how will I feel; if she was your child how will you feel?\n\n\u201cWe are neglecting what our holy books say about taking care of each other. I enjoin all of us to put heads and energy together towards providing an enabling environment for these kids,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, Abdullahi Hussaini bemoaned the failure of parents to utilize the free basic education in the state.\n\nHe called on the government to constitute a task force towards making education compulsory.\n\n\u201cGovernment should inaugurate a task force that will make school attendance compulsory as well as making hawking activities by children punishable by law,\u201d Hussaini said.\n\nAlso, the Executive Director, Saif Advocacy Foundation, Alhassan Yahya, while lauding current efforts by stakeholders, urged them to set agenda in challenging the government on state education.\n\nOn his part, Speaker, Children\u2019s Parliament Umar Abdullahi, tasked the government to ensure speedy domestication of the Child Rights Act, to protect the rights of children in the state, adding that employment of more female teachers to encourage school attendance.\n\nHe advised that more schools should be established within the communities to reduce long-distance between schools and homes.\n\nAbdullahi said, \u201cMany parents don\u2019t support their girls going to schools because of insecurity. Parents are afraid when their girls are going or coming back from school.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel good when girls are not educated. It is the right of every citizen to be educated. So why should the girls be denied this right? I call on the government to please look at girls education in Gombe State and find a solution.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Experts disagree as FG says new national carrier takes off April 2022",
          "text": "\u2022FG, Nigerians own 51 equity\n\n\u2022Let us discard national carrier for flag carrier \u2014Stakeholders\n\nBy Lawani Mikairu & Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\n\n\nBARRING any last minute change, the new national carrier, Nigerian Air, will begin flight operations in April 2022.But experts in the aviation sector think differently, saying a flag, rather than a national carrier, would be more appropriate.However, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, disclosed the news of take-off of the new carrier while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the virtual Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, yesterday.He explained that in the new national carrier, the federal government would have not more than five percent equity shares, while Nigerian entrepreneurs would have 46 percent equity shares, even as the international strategic partners will have 49 equity shares.Sirika said the Fedecal Executive Council gave approval for the new national carrier, adding that the new carrier iwould generate about 70 thousand jobs a few years after operations, noting this was higher than the total federal civil servants in the country.Recalling that over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name which was launched in 2018, the minister said: \u201cToday (yesterday) in council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. The first one is approval for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located in Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\u201dIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, follow ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in quotation in Europe, because all of the truth of regulation of civilization will appear on this platform, it\u2019s an extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\u201dThe contract was given to Messrs. Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik are the creators of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1,492,520,325, which will be including 7.5% VAT and completion period of six months. So that\u2019s the first memoranda.\u201dThe next one also is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\u201dThe structure of the proposed airline; government will be owning not more than 5%. So 5% is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46% will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. \u201dSo, if you add that, it\u2019s 51%. So, it\u2019s 51% majority shareholding by Nigerians and then 49% will be held by strategic equity partner or partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase, which is the next phase.\u201dThis airline, if started, and within the first few years, will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. It\u2019s importance had been well discussed, so I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\u201dBut one important item is the AU agenda 2063, which speaks to integration of Africa, which speaks to the cause and trade within Africa that is intra-Africa and to which also another flagship project of AU agenda 2063 called the Single African Air Transport Market, SAATM.\u201dNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive.\u201dIt\u2019s doable, it\u2019s time-taking, but with aviation, within a year, once the right policy is in place, like SAATM, you can connect Africa and then, of course, the needed integration will happen, part of AU agenda 2063, So, these are the two memoranda that were submitted, and gladly they were passed by Council.\u201dThe name is Nigerian Air which, of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to national debate and 400,000 people participated, choose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced at that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\u201dSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website, you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, on or before April 2022.\u201dMeanwhile, aviation stakeholders yesterday advised the federal government to shelve the idea of establishing a national carrier, arguing that it would be better to designate any of the existing domestic airlines as the country\u2019s flag carrier.Speaking with Vanguard yesterday on the new carrier, Group Captain John Ojikutu, retd, said government had spent too much time since 2017 on the issue of establishing a national carrier.He said: \u201d How long has it taken all the new airlines to prepare for their commercial operations? They all started much later than the \u2018national carrier\u2019 we began its rollout since 2017.\u201dMy worry is that it is too late a time for a national carrier or else we may end up with a \u2018government carrier; let us discard the \u2018national carrier\u2019 for a flag carrier now before we end up with a government carrier. \u201dThe way things have been going and are still going, I hope we won\u2019t end up with another failed attempt like Virgin Nigeria.\u201dHowever, the immediate past Secretary General of National Union of Air Transport Employees, NUATE, Comrade Yinka Abioye, shared a different view. He said the federal government could actualize the national carrier if it was determined to do so.Comrade Abioye told Vanguard that the Aviation Minister should be given the necessary support to get the national carrier on board..He said : \u201d I wish to congratulate the Honourable Minister , Aviation ,HMA, for his foresight and commitment to the growth and development of the Nigerian aviation system. As the de facto implementer of all relevant aviation policies, we shall look forward to seeing the National carrier unveiled as he has promised in 2022, God sparing our lives.\u201d Since the HMA holds the aces, knows more than what we know and the processes of delivering this expected baby, we shall give him all necessary support required. There is nothing impossible in Nigeria.\u201dA senior director and a stakeholder who didn\u2019t want his name in print because he is a serving officer, said the federal government cannot establish a national carrier now.He said: \u201cThe good will and confidence of aviation stakeholders have been lost. We have been on this national carrier thing since this government came to power. How long does it take to establish an airline?\u2019",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon & Adeola Badru, LAGOS\n\nTHE pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere and Ilana Omo Oodua, IOO, yesterday, tackled the Department of State Service, DSS, for filing extradition charges against Yoruba Nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho, who is currently detained in the Benin Republic.\n\nThe DSS had disclosed that the process of extraditing Igboho to Nigeria was ongoing.\n\nAfenifere in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Jare Ajayi said that the intensified effort of the Federal Government to extradite Igboho from the Benin Republic is a clear indication that the government is \u201cnot committed to genuinely tackle the challenges thrown up by those who are agitating for self-determination in the country.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said: \u201cWere the Federal Government to be sincere with its recent declaration of wanting to settle the agitators\u2019 issues politically, it would not be pursuing the path of extradition that it is bent on doing presently.\n\n\u201cNot only that, the government would obey the verdict given by a High Court in Ibadan on September 17, 2021, by paying the \u20a620.5 billion as ordered rather than going on an appeal.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government genuinely wanted to solve the problems thrown up by self-determination agitations, it should obey the judgements already given in favour of the agitators and convene meetings with leaders of the ethnic nationalities particularly those from the South-East and South-West where Kanu and Igboho came from.\n\n\u201cSolicitors for the agitators and interested stakeholders should also be present at the meetings. Such meetings should be convened without delay.\u201d\n\nIlana Omo Oodua flays DSS\n\nSimilarly, addressing newsmen during the inauguration of Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide Elders Advisory Council, the spokesman of the group, Maxwell Adeleye dismissed the claims by the DSS that it has filed extradition charges to bring Sunday Igboho to Nigeria.\n\nAdeleye said: \u201cThey (FG) don\u2019t have money to pay the fine and that is why they wanted to quash the judgement. Also, the appeal for a stay of execution that was filed by DSS has not been granted by the court.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the group, Prof. Banji Akintoye, while speaking at the event, noted that the Advisory Council became important to liaise with traditional rulers and other stakeholders towards ensuring that self-determination comes to reality.\n\nAkintoye said: \u201cWe are ready to fight for Yoruba nation and until we succeed, there are some things the elders can do that the youths cannot do. Of course, the youths are also key towards the realisation of Yoruba nation through protests, rallies, social media, and others but they also need the elders to champion the course.\u201d",

The argument seeking to liken meter to phone is fraudulent and unfounded. CARE rejects this as well as the related argument canvassing that the sale of meters should be liberalized.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate our insistence that meter is the property of DISCOs and its free provision for adequate measurement of the accurate amount of energy consumed is the responsibility of DISCOs. Interestingly, this obligation of DISCO was acknowledged in the agreement it signed prior to its acquisition of PHCN in 2013.\n\n\u201cAccording to this agreement, all Nigerian Electricity consumers were promised to be freely metered by DISCOs within 18moths of the acquisition\u201d.",

          "title": "Nigeria Will Survive Its Challenges, Despite Escalating Grievances, Says Fitch",
          "text": "\u2022Predicts 2.8% GDP Growth for Next Year\n\n\u2022Insists rising population, high unemployment, competition for diminishing resources exacerbating grievances\n\nObinna Chima\n\nNotwithstanding threats posed by the Islamist insurgency in the north, clashes between Fulani herdsmen and pastoralists in the Middle Belt region as well as growing unrest in the South which have continued to threaten the country\u2019s existence, Nigeria will survive its challenges over the next decade even though they would weigh on its economic growth by deterring investment and impeding private consumption, the Fitch Solutions Group, an affiliate of global ratings agency, Fitch, has stated.\n\nThe UK-based organisation stated this in a report titled, \u201cNigeria Country Risk Report \u2013 Q1- 2022,\u201d which also included a 10-year forecast to 2030, obtained yesterday.\n\n\u201cRising population levels, high unemployment and competition for diminishing resources in a period of slower economic growth will exacerbate ethnic and religious grievances in Nigeria over the next decade, and the country will continue to face security challenges on three major fronts.\n\n\u201cOur core view is that the Nigerian state will survive these interlocking challenges, although they will weigh on growth by deterring investment and impeding private consumption.\n\nThere is a downside risk, however, that ethno-religious divides will eventually lead to the break-up of the state. The next several years will be a major test for Nigeria, as the slow recovery following the Covid-19 pandemic deepens poverty and further erodes the government\u2019s ability to provide public goods. A weakened state may struggle to unite the diverse country, which has Africa\u2019s largest population.\n\n\u201cNigeria already faces three clear security threats: the Islamist insurgency in the north, clashes between Fulani herdsmen and pastoralists in the Middle Belt region, and growing unrest in the south. Even so, our core view remains that the federal republic will still exist at the end of the decade. Democracy will become increasingly entrenched, and social unrest, while likely to increase, will remain contained to the sub-regional level,\u201d it predicted.\n\nThe report predicted that Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would grow by a modest 2.1 per cent in 2021, after contracting by an estimated 1.9 per cent; and accelerate to 2.8 per cent in 2022 on the back of stronger household spending, and increases in fixed investment and oil exports.\n\nIn addition, Fitch, in the report, disclosed that it had revised its forecast for Nigeria\u2019s 2021 budget deficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP, from 4.2 per cent, following the publication of official data indicating weaker federal government revenue than it had previously anticipated. It anticipated that the country\u2019s current account deficit would narrow slightly to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2022, largely as a result of a further narrowing of the trade deficit.\n\nFurthermore, the research firm predicted that in 2022, strengthening economic growth would provide the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) room to shift its focus to containing inflation and hiking the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 100 basis points to 12.50 per cent.\n\nIt expressed doubt over the ability of the Nigerian government to implement major economic reforms ahead of the 2023 general election, saying campaigns ahead of political parties\u2019 election primaries would be the focus of attention between now and 2022.\n\nThe federal government had disclosed a plan to remove subsidy on petrol, which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy, by May next year. The Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) recommended the removal of the controversial fuel subsidy, even as the World Bank and some other institutions had warned about the dire consequence of retaining the policy.\n\nBut Fitch, in the report, pointed out that, \u201cCampaigning ahead of party primaries will shift political attention away from reforms in fourth quarter of 2021 and 2022.\u201d\n\nIt noted that although the President Muhammadu Buhari administration had made notable progress in 2021, particularly as regards simplifying the exchange rate regime and passing landmark oil sector reforms, further significant progress was unlikely this quarter and in 2022.\n\nThis is because politicians from the two major political parties \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 would focus on campaigning and mobilising support ahead of their primary elections, likely to be held in the second half of 2022, the report said.\n\nThe Fitch report stated, \u201cIn this context, progress on politically unpopular reforms, such the reduction of fuel and electricity subsidies, is unlikely in the coming quarters, and the resulting continued pressure on public finances will contribute to Nigeria posting large fiscal deficits in 2021 and 2022 (we forecast deficits of 4.8% and 4.5% of GDP respectively).\n\n\u201cReflecting this, we have lowered the \u2018policy-making process\u2019 component score in our Short-Term Political Risk Index from 56.7 to 53.3 (scores out of 100; lower score indicates higher risk).\u201d\n\nFitch Solutions further anticipated that campaigning ahead of Nigeria\u2019s presidential election in 2023 would dominate the political agenda in 2022.\n\nBuhari would step down in 2023, as required by the Nigerian constitution, which limits presidents to two terms in office.\n\nFitch stated in the report, \u201cIn the coming quarters, we expect potential candidates from the two main parties \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 and their supporters to ramp up preparations to secure their party\u2019s respective nominations for president and vice-president.\n\n\u201cSeveral major figures are already actively campaigning, although most have not officially declared their intention to run.\n\n\u201cFor the APC, these include former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu and current Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, while front-runners for the PDP include former president of the senate Bukola Saraki, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.\u201d\n\nFitch also predicted that sub-national tensions would grow as political leaders seek to champion the interests of their core supporters with a view to strengthening their political positions. It noted that under Nigeria\u2019s long-standing custom of alternating between presidents from the predominantly Muslim North and the largely Christian South, a practice known locally as \u201czoning\u201d, the candidates both parties would choose to contest the presidency ought to come from one of Nigeria\u2019s southern states given that Buhari is a Muslim northerner. However, in late September an association of governors of northern states rejected the practice, claiming (according to media reports) that it contradicts the constitution.\n\nThe Fitch report said this position by the northern governors would likely exacerbate rifts with southern political leaders from both parties who believe that it would be their turn to control the presidency.\n\nAdding to these tensions is a growing row over the rights of states to collect and retain funds from Value Added Tax (VAT), the report noted.\n\nIt said, \u201cWhile wealthier southern states, notably Lagos and Rivers states, have introduced legislation to enable state-level agencies to collect and manage VAT revenue rather than the Federal Inland Revenue Service, this move has been fiercely opposed by the federal government and several northern states.\n\n\u201cThe latter generally are poorer and would potentially see a fall in their VAT revenue, which under the current system effectively leads to southern states cross-subsidising northern ones.\n\n\u201cThe stand-off has resulted in a lengthy legal dispute, and we expect that deteriorating relations between northern and southern political leaders will hamper coordination on key programmes, including rolling out the next phases of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Activates 30-year development plan\n\nSegun James\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State presented a N1.388 trillion Appropriation Bill for 2022 to the House of Assembly yesterday, earmarking a whopping 59 per cent of the budget to capital expenditure in order to service key growth areas, consolidate the recovery of the state\u2019s economy, and positively transform livelihoods.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the state would be spending N325 billion to deliver vital infrastructure projects in key sectors to energise and expand the growth of the state\u2019s economy.\n\nThe budget proposal, christened, \u201cBudget of Consolidation,\u201d would be the last full-year fiscal plan of the state before the next general election.\n\nThe key areas of growth identified by the governor included works and infrastructure, waterfront infrastructure development, agriculture, transportation, energy and mineral resources, tourism, entertainment and creative industry, commerce and industry, and wealth creation and employment.\n\nThe human capital development drive of the Sanwo-Olu administration was projected to take a leap in 2022, with a combined allocation of 21.24 per cent in the total expenditure to education and health.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the coming year presented an opportunity for the state government to consolidate on progress recorded by his administration, while leveraging investment in-flow, partnership, and business-friendly policies to maximally translate his achievements into noticeable positive impact in the lives of residents.\n\nAbout N823.4 billion, representing 59 per cent of the 2022 budget, was earmarked for capital expenditure.\n\nRecurrent expenditure, representing 41 per cent, was proposed at N565 billion, which included personnel cost, overhead, and debt servicing.\n\nThe governor noted that his administration had clearly articulated its vision in governance through the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda in the last two years, adding that the state is now looking towards the future with the activation of the implementation of a 30-year development plan (2021-2051), which replaced the 13-year growth plan developed in 2012.\n\nHe said, \u201cYear 2022 budget is the next step on our journey to true and sustainable greatness in Lagos. The challenging environment requires that we focus our interventions on areas of greatest social impact and achieving the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest possible time. Next year is an excellent opportunity for us to consolidate on what we have done so far, and ensure that every effort, investment inflow, partnership, business policy is translating maximally into noticeable positive impact in the lives of our people.\n\n\u201cIt is in this light that we are presenting the Year 2022 Budget of Consolidation with a size of N1,388,285,459,990.51. This financial proposal is presented with a sense of duty and absolute commitment to the transformation of Lagos to a preferred global destination for residence, commerce, and investment.\n\n\u201cThe budget projects to see a continuing but gradual recovery to growth in economic activity as the global economy cautiously recovers from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nOf the total proposed expenditure, N1.135 trillion would accrue from Internally Generated Revenues (IGRs) and federal transfers, while deficit financing of N253 billion would be sourced from external and domestic loans, and bonds projected to be within the state\u2019s fiscal sustainability parameters.\n\nThe state also earmarked an aggregate of N137.64 billion, representing 9.92 per cent of the 2022 budget, for the funding of green investment in environment, social protection, housing and community amenities.\n\nOn security, the governor explained that the state\u2019s continued investment in the sector had produced positive results, stressing that more allocation would be channelled into security in 2022 to make Lagos safer for living, working, and investment.\n\nDespite the global economic downturn, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos had seen more construction machinery deployed to deliver new infrastructure in the areas of roads, rail, housing, health, education, and waterways.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere has been significant progress on the Lagos Rail Mass Transit projects, which include both the 27-kilometre Blue line that will run from Okokomaiko to Marina, and the 32-kilometre Red line that will run from Agbado to Oyigbo and eventually to Marina.\n\n\u201cThese rails, when completed, will deliver a combined 32.5 million people every month on their respective routes, reducing travel time by over 250 per cent, increasing the productivity and quality of life of our people.\n\n\u201cThe Red line will come with eight new modern train stations, 10 new overpasses and 13 pedestrian bridges. These ambitious projects are expected to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2022.\u201d\n\nThe outgoing year\u2019s budget, Sanwo-Olu said, performed \u201cremarkably well\u201d, despite the challenges encountered by the state. He stated that the expenditure performance at the third quarter of 2021 rose to 80 per cent.\n\nThe governor said the need to stabilise the state\u2019s economy led to the adoption of far-reaching cost saving measures, including restructuring of local borrowings to reduce overall debt service obligations on Lagos.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cThe state government has successfully restructured all existing loan facilities, translating into a reduction in interest rates from an average of 18 per cent to about 12.75 per cent. This year, Fitch, a reputable international rating agency, upgraded the rating of Lagos from AA+ to AAA, reflecting Lagos\u2019 capacity to service its financial obligations, compared with national and international peers, as well as its resilient operating performance during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe governor thanked Lagosians for supporting and standing by his administration in the past two years. He said there were more challenges ahead, and urged residents to join hands with him in delivering his programmes for the common good. He assured that the pace of governance would be amplified in the coming years.\n\nSpeaker, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, praised the governor for the \u201coutstanding performance\u201d of the 2021 budget, especially in infrastructural renewal and wealth creation among others. Obasa promised a speedy and meticulous vetting of the 2022 budget proposal. He said the progress under the Sanwo-Olu administration was commendable, but urged the executive arm to look inward and devise other methods of improving the state\u2019s IGR beyond the current sources.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022FG, Nigerians own 51 equity shares, to generate 70,000 jobs\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe national carrier, Nigeria Air, is set to begin flight operations by April 2022. The new official airline would have 51 per cent of its equity shares owned by the Nigerian government and people, with foreign partners having the remaining 49 per cent.\n\nThe venture is expected to generate 70,000 jobs.\n\nThese were disclosed to newsmen yesterday by Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, at the end of the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.\n\nSirika explained that in the new national carrier, the federal government will have five percent equity shares, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 per cent equity shares, while the expected international strategic partners would have 49 equity shares.\n\nSirika stressed that FEC had given approval for the new national carrier. He said over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name, which was launched in 2018.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cToday (Wednesday) in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. One of the memos is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline: government will be owning not more than five per cent. So five per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46 per cent will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51 per cent.\n\n\u201cIt is 51 per cent majority shareholding by Nigerians and then 49 per cent will be held by strategic equity partner or partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase, which is the next phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so, I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\u201d\n\nSirika noted African Union\u2019s agenda 2063 on the integration of the continent in terms of trade, and another flagship project, the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM).\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air, because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further said, \u201cThe name is Nigerian Air, which, of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to national debate and 400,000 people participated, chose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website, you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, in or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that FEC also approved another memo for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, follow ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in quotation in Europe, because all of the truth of regulation of civilisation will appear on this platform, it\u2019s an extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik are the creators of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1,492,520,325, which will be including 7.5 per cent VAT and completion period of six months.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "German sportswear manufacturing giant, PUMA plans to sue the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.\n\nThe development comes as the sportswear manufacturer terminated a four-year contract it had with Nigeria in a letter dated Wednesday, August 4, 2021, and signed by the company\u2019s director, Manuel Edlheimb.\n\nAccording to reports, the AFN under the leadership of Ibrahim Gusau had entered into a controversial $2.76 million deal with PUMA on July 24, 2019, in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe deal reportedly led to a major crisis that split the athletics body into two factions, with Gusau and AFN First Vice President, Sunday Adeleye accused of sidelining other members of the board during the signing of the deal.\n\nThe deal, signed by the Gusau-led AFN, was due to expire in 2022, Punch reports.\n\nPart of the contract is that PUMA will supply apparel to all age categories to Nigeria\u2019s Athletics team for four years at no cost.\n\nIn addition, gold medalists at the Olympic Games will earn $15,000 (N6 million), silver medalists will get $5,000 (N2 million) while a bronze medal will fetch athletes wearing the PUMA apparel at the games $3,000 (N1.2 million).\n\nIn the latest development, PUMA officials have got in touch with officials of Gusau-led AFN informing them of an intention to sue.\n\nAccording to a source quoted by Punch, the sports ministry would be made a party to the suit \u201cbecause they issued a memo granting AFN permission to seek sponsorship. PUMA sees AFN as a representative of Nigeria with that memo. It gave them confidence that AFN had approval. They also claimed that as of the time of signing the contract, the parties involved are recognised by law and FG, and there was no faction to warrant suspicion. They believe an administration is a continuum and the agreement has government backing..\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by the AFN First Vice President, Adeleye while appearing on Arise TV as a guest on Thursday.\n\nWhile displaying evidence and documents showing the FG\u2019s approval for the federation to seek a sponsor, Adeleye said, \u201cThe contract is a non-disclosure one. It is between PUMA and AFN with FMYSD\u2019s permission. We warned that this may lead to litigation and wrote to all parties involved, including finance and justice ministries.\n\n\u201cWe are sure that PUMA will go to court on this matter. Their officials have called that they are sending documents from their legal department. We wrote the minister on the implications for Nigeria. This won\u2019t make other companies deal with Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that Gusau-led AFN did everything possible to ensure that the image of the country is protected.\n\nOn why the kits were kept in a store, he said, \u201cOur AFN has been barred from using the facility in the stadium and we needed to run the activities of the association. We have a store and office that we run. The constitution didn\u2019t say our office should be in the stadium.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would take responsibility for the termination of the contract, Adeleye said, \u201cWe should be awarded because we are patriotic. The Federal Government asked federations to look for sponsors (before Sunday Dare). This contract precedes him. They are aware of the contract.\n\n\u201cWe worked with instruction. We looked for a sponsor so that the burden can be taken off the Federal Government. The sports ministry should be sanctioned. We need a shake-up in the sports ministry.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the minister and sports ministry under his administration. Our problems have never been this worse. Federations have issues but not to this extend. Despite a court order, the minister is resolute in destroying some people. We gave the kits out, the ministry said they were not going to use the kits.\u201d\n\nThe sports ministry\u2019s had insisted that Nigerian athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will not wear PUMA because of the leadership tussle between the Gusau-led AFN board and the one being championed by the sports minister, Dare.\n\nIt was learnt that several efforts were made to give the athletes the PUMA kits, including shipping bags of kits with 40 items each to Tokyo through the Nigerian Embassy in Japan but to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of State Services (DSS) last year cleared Gusau and his vice president, Adeleye over corruption allegations levelled against them by the sports ministry.\n\nThe sports ministry in 2020 petitioned the DSS over the AFN\u2019s partnership deal with PUMA to kit Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams until 2023.\n\nThe DSS' response to the sports ministry\u2019s petition, titled \u201cRe: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD), Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and Alhaji Shehu Gusau\u201d, dated September 3, 2020, and signed on behalf of the Director-General of the DSS by Bello Mustapha, was received on September 4, 2020, by the sports ministry.\n\nIn the letter, the DSS stated, \u201cThis Service (DSS) has thoroughly investigated the matter regarding the Puma deal. The under-listed findings were established:\n\n\u201cAthletics Federation of Nigeria entered into a valid contract with Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited.\n\n\u201cThe AFN gave Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited the mandate to source for sponsors for Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams on her behalf in a letter dated September 4, 2018, signed by Ademu A. Elijah, Secretary-General of the AFN.\n\n\u201cThe AFN duly authorised Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited to deal with Puma on behalf of the federation in a letter dated June 23, 2019, signed by Patrick Estate, Head Marketing; and there is no evidence that Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited received money meant for AFN from Puma.\n\n\u201cIn view, therefore, it is reiterated that the FMYSD and the AFN board should employ an internal mechanism to resolve the lingering dispute between them.\u201d\n\nThe contract termination comes a few hours after a trending video showed Nigeria\u2019s shot put medal hopeful, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, washing his jersey ahead of his final game at the ongoing Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe caption in the video indicated that the athlete was given one jersey for the competition.\n\n\u201cWhen you made the Olympic Finals, but you only have one jersey,\u201d he wrote.",

          "text": "France and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema, was sentenced to a one-year suspended jail term on Wednesday.\n\nHe was found guilty of complicity in the attempted blackmail of a former international teammate over a sex tape.\n\nThe Versailles court also fined him \u20ac75,000 ($84,170) and ordered him to pay former teammate, Mathieu Valbuena \u20ac80,000 to cover legal costs and \u20ac150,000 in damages together with his three other co-accused.\n\nHowever, Benzema\u2019s lawyer has vowed to appeal against the verdict.\n\nBenzema, who had denied any wrongdoing, was not in court. He is due to play for Real Madrid against Moldovan side Sheriff Tiraspol later in the day.\n\n\u201cThis outcome in no way corresponds with the reality of events,\u201d lawyer Antoine Vey told reporters afterwards.\n\nEarlier this month, President of the French Football Federation, Noel Le Graet, said Benzema would not be excluded from the national team if he was convicted and given the suspended sentence prosecutors wanted.\n\n\u201cThe coach will always be responsible for his selection and Benzema will not be left out because of an eventual judicial sanction,\u201d Le Graet told Le Parisien.\n\nProsecutors had argued that Benzema had encouraged Valbuena to pay a suspected group of blackmailers to keep the sexually explicit tape out of the public eye.\n\nThey said Valbuena got the first of several phone calls threatening to reveal the tape in June 2015.\n\nValbuena had told the court it was clear the caller wanted money and that the blackmail attempt left him scared for his career and place in the national squad.\n\nThe Real Madrid striker was recruited by the alleged blackmailers to encourage Valbuena to pay as his teammate stalled, the prosecution had added.\n\nThe French footballer had shown no goodwill to Valbuena and pretended to have his best interests at heart, the judges said in their written ruling.\n\nBenzema had \u201cdeliberately helped the authors of the attempted blackmail of Valbuena,\u201d they added.\n\nBoth Benzema and Valbuena lost their places in the national team in the wake of the scandal, dubbed the \u201csex tape affair.\u201d\n\nBenzema, 33, who has played more than 90 times for his country, was recalled to the France squad for this year\u2019s European Championship.\n\nAmong Benzema\u2019s co-defendants were childhood friend Karim Zenati, who acted as an intermediary, and Mustapha Zouaoui, one of the suspected architects of the scam.\n\nAll four defendants were found guilty in connection with the attempted blackmail.",

          "title": "Inside Benue communities where residents dig shallow pits to get dirty drinking water",
          "text": "BY AWO JAIRUS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory Highlights\n\nScarcity of clean and safe water is on the rise across Benue communities.\n\nResidents say several people have died as a result of the contaminated water.\n\nVillagers suffer from diarrhea and typhoid.\n\nMost of the communities have been left to their fate.\n\nIt was about 11am when this reporter disembarked from the rickety taxi that took him through the long drive from Makurdi to Agasha motor park in Guma LGA. The weather was hot and even the sand had been heated up. A handful of residents were seen taking shelter by the entrances of their huts. The sleepy community was troubled and the troubles were evident on the faces of its residents.\n\nThe community river once served the residents so well that they never felt the need to have boreholes. The river which was once clean and \u201csafe for consumption\u201d has now dried up, resulting in extreme water scarcity.\n\nA significant number of residents rely on a shallow well dug inside a swamp beside the dried-up river. Although water from the well is unclean, residents have no choice but to queue up daily with different sizes of bowls and basins to fetch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut before they ingest the water, they must make sure to boil it.\n\n\u201cEvery day I come here and see the water dried up, it makes me cry,\u201d said an old woman addressed as Mama.\n\n\u201cNow, not only do we use dirty water, it is not enough for everyone. To have water at all for your daily usage, you will have to wake up around 3am to join a long queue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the wells dug in some compounds provide cleaner water to the residents, they dry up once the rainy season is over.\n\n\u201cAnd when that happens, we usually fall back on swampy areas for water. That\u2019s where diseases like the one that made me blind come from,\u201d said James, an elderly resident of Agasha.\n\nMike Igber, chairman of the water, sanitation and hygiene committee (WASHCom) in Agasha, said the military once donated a hand pump borehole to the community but it stopped working \u201ca long time ago\u201d and no attempt has been made to fix it.\n\n\u201cThe saddest tale is that no state government in the last 50 years has ever done anything about the community\u2019s water dearth,\u201d said Igber.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the community health centre, the water used in treating patients was not much better. Although there is a motorised borehole at the clinic, the faucets are no longer functioning, hence the clinic resorts to a 60-feet well that also serves some villagers. The well is without a cover, while the water is milky and has black particles.\n\n\u201cWe have a few common diseases and health challenges in this area,\u201d said Fabian Tarki, one of the officials at the health centre.\n\n\u201cSome of the diseases commonly troubling our residents in this community are diarrhea, typhoid fever and malaria. And I tell you these are on a high scale.\n\n\u201cAnd whether we like it or not, all of them can be traced to bad water. We seriously have a major challenge of bad water in this community and we urgently need intervention to save our lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use dirty water to \u2018bathe, cook, wash\u2019 in Ipaav\n\nLike it is in Agasha, the river in Ipaav, Gboko LGA, once served the community, but these days, it has dried up and the residents have dug a makeshift well in a swamp around the area. Although the water is unclean, residents have no choice but to use it for their daily needs.\n\nJoseph Agibee Terlumun, the community spokesperson, said it\u2019s disheartening watching the residents drink the water.\n\n\u201cI was born in this community just as my father was. Though, I wouldn\u2019t know how long this community is; but I can state categorically that I have never seen any government agencies here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is only during electioneering when some of them will send their boys to come and give us things like seasonings and salt just to vote for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe use this water to bathe, cook, wash our plates and clothes. In short, we use it for everything water is used for because we don\u2019t have any other water. It is this one we drink most of the time because going to someone else\u2019s well could result in insults being hurled on you; so we resolved to manage our own water.\u201d\n\nTerhundu Agibee, a mother of five, said the health officials have advised her to stop giving the water to her children.\n\n\u201cMy youngest child is the only one that has never tasted that water,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey advised that I should wait until after six months of birth before trying to give her. And while I have given my other children the water, I have to give this one someday too because there is nothing I can do.\u201d\n\nOye, where an unknown epidemic \u2018killed many\u2019\n\nSurrounded by rivers on every side, water scarcity is not a problem in Oye-Obi, a community in Oju LGA. But while water is always available, the River Obi which the community relies on is permanently unclean; it is dirty and has an offensive smell.\n\nRegardless of the state of the water, residents are always at the river bank to scoop some for their daily use.\n\nWhen this reporter visited, women were found milling around the river bank with their basins and bowls while three men fetched water into a canoe, after which they lifted it on their shoulders and headed for the village square where they distributed it to vulnerable and older residents.\n\nAt the only motorised borehole outlet in the community, women and children queued up to fetch as little or as much as they could get. Some were lucky while others went back home disappointed. Water is pumped once daily from the solar-powered borehole, and once it is exhausted, the residents would have to wait till the next day.\n\n\u201cOurs is now like a community that has never been a part of Benue state or this whole country,\u201d says 72-year-old Abraham Ogbu Ijih.\n\n\u201cOur lives are now marked by abject poverty and poor living conditions. We are surrounded by water and forest on every side. Yet, we are thirsty with no access to clean water.\u201d\n\nIjih, a visually impaired man who has lived in Oye all his life, said he lost his wife and children to a \u201cwater epidemic\u201d in 2020.\n\n\u201cI went blind six years ago. I wasn\u2019t blind from childhood. But in 2020, I lost my wife and three children to water impurities. There was a period in this community where a water epidemic killed about 273 people according to our communal records,\u201d the former rice farmer said.\n\n\u201cBefore her death, my wife was my strong support who took care of me, dressed me, and of course, provided food for me. My only surviving child is little Christiana, who survived the water epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe community prince, simply addressed as Ogbaji, said he was also a victim of the unknown epidemic.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it led to the deployment of officials of the National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) about one year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, till now, NCDC has not been able to provide a name for the ailments and therefore, no medications have been prescribed to help us.\u201d\n\nClement Onaa, chairman of Oju LGA, acknowledged the water problems in the communities but said there has been some intervention from the state and federal governments.\n\n\u201cWe are working in collaboration with the state government and the federal ministry of water resources and environmental sanitation and we have recorded some level of intervention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome of those interventions include the provision of solar-powered motorised boreholes to the people of Oye-Obi. The community had water pollution sometime ago and part of the interventions was to ameliorate their plight of bad water.\n\n\u201cWaters in our place are always recharged with rainfall and whenever there is no rainfall, the volume of water reduces.\u201d\n\nOnaa called on the state and federal government to provide more boreholes to the affected communities.\n\nOtobi residents live on dirty water\n\nIf you visit Otobi community in Otukpo LGA, you won\u2019t miss the shallow wells dug on both sides of the road. And despite the milky colour of the water, children are always found around them; excited to fill their basins and pots to the brim.\n\nRichard Inalegwu, a resident of the community, said they have no functioning borehole, adding that all the residents drink from the same place, save for those who don\u2019t mind walking long distances to some neighbouring communities that have boreholes.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to drinkable water, we don\u2019t have options. It\u2019s either you drink the water or not. Since I was born and have been living in this community,\u201d he said.\n\nRachel Agbenu, another resident who had a heap of dirty clothes to wash, said: \u201cThe scarcity of water is worrisome. My family has not been able to wash our clothes for the past three weeks because there is no water. We have even reused some of our dirty clothes.\n\n\u201cJust to drink water, we often go to a nearby community a little far from here. Even at that, the water is not always clean and people are always too much there, and there is never enough water to go round everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, we spend nights there.\u201d\n\nIgwe-Ito: Water scarcity causes conflict\n\nWater is gold in Igwe-Ito, Obi LGA, and this triggers animosity and ill-feeling among some residents. When it comes to who fetches first, women and children would argue, fight and squabble.\n\nThe community has three hand pump boreholes that have not been functional for 10 years, hence the non-availability of clean water.\n\nNow, residents drink from three-foot wells dug under a bamboo tree in a swampy area. But the wells dry up intermittently even though about five are dug per time so that, when one gets dry, another serves as a replacement.\n\nJoseph Ibi, a surgical pathologist, said the major issue in the community is blindness with a few cases of bilharziasis, malaria and typhoid.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have potable water here so the villagers get their water from caves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a medical personnel, I know to some extent that bad water often causes harm. Aside from that, however, it is not unusual for people from 45 years of age to develop eye problems, making life hard for them. Many residents don\u2019t even know that eye challenges can come from bad water.\u201d\n\nContaminated water, experts say, can harbour bacteria, such as those responsible for diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis A and polio.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, approximately 297,000 children under five die yearly from diseases linked to poor sanitation, poor hygiene, or unsafe drinking water.\n\nHow climate change contributes to rivers drying up\n\nHabib Muhammed, a researcher, said climate change has a direct impact on rivers drying up, especially those that are rain-fed. He said global warming has caused intense heat which translates to more evaporation from the water bodies.\n\n\u201cRivers that get their recharging from direct precipitation only are known to be dried especially when there is low rainfall,\u201d Muhammed said.\n\n\u201cOne other thing is the issue of harsh solar radiation due to climate change. Harsh solar radiation causes high evaporation which eventually leads to gradual dryness of rivers.\u201d\n\nMuhammed said rain-fed rivers are known as nonperennial rivers because they do not flow all year long but only in particular seasons, unlike perennial rivers.\n\nHe said the effects of human activities like damming and irrigation on rain-fed rivers contribute to them drying up faster than usual.\n\nAttempts to speak to officials at local and state government levels to comment on efforts being made to alleviate the plight of the affected Benue communities proved abortive.\n\nSeveral attempts to speak with Joshua Dondo Ahire, the Benue commissioner for water resources and environment, were also futile.\n\nThis report is supported by OSIWA, under the Campus Civic Media Campaign Project of Cable Foundation, in partnership with TheCable.",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 has been a good year for African startups. This year, the continent has already minted five unicorns. After the lull in investment activities in 2020, investments in African startups are on track to exceed the $2 billion record set in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, the bulk of the funding has gone to fintech startups with the fragmented nature of the continent\u2019s financial system providing an opportunity for innovative founders and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurin Hainy, CEO and Co-Founder of FairMoney\n\nAs of October 2021, Africa: The Big Deal reported that 57% of the amounts raised which was slightly above $1.6 billion has gone to fintech startups. One such fintech is FairMoney, a digital bank that currently offers lending services in Nigeria, India, and France.\n\nIn July, the startup raised a $42 million Series B led by Tiger Global to consolidate its position in India and Nigeria. This follows its $10 million Series A round raised in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, November 18, 2021, the company hosted investors, the media, and industry leaders at its first investor conference. Following a brief introduction, the CEO and co-founder, Laurin Hainy took to the stage to share the startup\u2019s journey since inception.\n\nIn his welcome address, Hainy revealed that the conference was \u201cconceived to provide an avenue for capital market operators, investors, fintech players, regulators, industry associations, and other financial industry participants to discuss the role of digital financial models in providing meaningful financial inclusion for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Patryk Kalisz, Head of Controlling and Reporting, FairMoney; Siddharth Kulkarni,\n\nExecutive Sponsor, Lending, Nigeria at FairMoney; Nicolas Berthozat, Co-Founder\n\nFairMoney and Juris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161, Head of Risk, Nigeria, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s\n\nconference.\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals and small businesses without collateral. This is the segment FairMoney serves and Yaw Mante, the startup\u2019s Head of Finance revealed that not only have they been able to offer loans to these people, but they have also had a very low default rate.\n\nHe disclosed that in order to do this, the startup makes use of data science and underwriting algorithms to predict how likely an individual is to default on their loan before deciding how much risk they are able to take.\n\nIn the absence of data on users, the startup may initially give such customers smaller amounts to gauge their ability to repay the loans. Depending on how the borrower performs, they are then able to offer higher amounts to them. So far, in 2021, the startup has given out loans worth more than \u20a670 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Oluwatomide Oluwole, Finance Manager, FairMoney; Henry Obiekea, VP Capital\n\nMarkets, FairMoney; Yaw Mante, Head, Finance \u2013 FairMoney and James Edeh, Head,\n\nCompliance, FairMoney, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s conference.\n\nHaving recently acquired a microfinance license, Mante explained the reason for that, \u201cLoans are not the only products that our customers need. They need to be able to pay, they need to be able to save, they need to be able to invest. The way that we think about our business is that we look at our customers, we look at what they need and we try to work with them to provide that.\n\nIn order to do all of these things, we need to upscale our license and hence why we acquired the microfinance license.

This is just above the global average of 11.7%.\n\nThe report was based on a survey conducted on 1,205 Nigerian Internet users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria is the sixth country with the highest rate of NFT adoption out of the 20 countries surveyed. The top five countries were the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\n\nSurprisingly, the US, UK, and Japan, were the bottom three. The survey also went on to estimate that Nigeria\u2019s NFT ownership rate could reach 35% as 21.7% of the surveyed Internet users, plan to own NFTs.\n\nHold on a minute. Can 1,205 Internet users out of 101.72 million tell the true story about NFTs in Nigeria?\n\nHowever, if we consider the fact that Nigeria also ranked sixth in the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis maybe Finders.com\u2019s report isn\u2019t too far fetched.\n\nWhat do you think? Are Nigerians really that big on NFTs? Hit reply and let\u2019s know what you think.\n\nAsilimia\u2019s $2m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsilimia team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nAfrican fintech startup, Asilimia, has raised $2 million to help African Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), digitise their operations and connect them to the formal financial economy. The funding comprises a $1 million pre-seed and $1 million in debt financing.\n\nThe round saw investment from serial entrepreneur, Fredrik Jung Abbou, Co-founder of two unicorns \u2014 Kry, a telemedicine startup and fintech startup, Lendo. Other investors include Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Bpifrance and GreenTec Capital Partners\n\nHow does Asilimia work? The startup helps MSMEs digitise and formalise their operations \u2014 payments, revenue collection, and accounting \u2014 with its digital platform while providing them with credit facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Tekwane Mwendwa and Morgane Kablan, it helps business owners track expenses, payments, and get financial insights on their mobile phones.\n\nWhile Asilimia\u2019s mission could formalise MSMEs on the continent, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 45% were subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2019 according to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA). That number, however, is expected to reach 50% by 2025.\n\nThe startup plans to grow its team and expand into more East African markets with the funding.\n\nOnePipe\u2019s $3.5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePipe team\n\nNigerian fintech API, OnePipe, has closed a $3.5 million seed, co-led by Atlantica Ventures, Tribe Capital and V&R Associates. Other investors include Techstars, Ingressive Capital and Canaan Partners.\n\nOnePipe CEO and Founder, Ope Adeoye, told TechCrunch, that the startup offers embedded banking or banking as a service, \u201cmeaning, we make it possible for non-financial institutions, or businesses in general, to offer banking services to their customers.\u201d\n\nA little back story: Adeoye was a Senior Software Engineer at Interswitch before moving to Zain Nigeria.\n\nInterestingly, he moved back to Interswitch to lead the creation of Quickteller. After eleven years at Interswitch, Adeoye built OnePipe in November 2018 to create seamless partnerships between fintechs and banks.\n\nWith this new funding, the startup has plans to expand into other African countries through a partnership with Sendy, a logistics and freight company.\n\nWant to know more about OnePipe?

Closer home, Ajibade Oluwatosin, popularly known as Mr Eazi, has in a short time built a career that only few dream of.\n\nAfter leaving the university with a degree in mechanical engineering, Mr Eazi tried his hands at various things, including gold trading. His friends came through with a $1,000 contribution to shoot his first music video, and he has not looked back since then.\n\nHe draws parallels between his work as a creative and entrepreneur, pointing out that just as a business has customers, a musician\u2019s fans are his customers.\n\nFor The Experts this week, he shares his journey with our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole.\n\nRead more: \u201cWatch out for Pastor Eazi!\u201d \u2013 Mr Eazi on creative prospects beyond tech investments\n\nHow Thepeer plans to aid the interoperability of businesses in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Okoh and Chike Ononye, Co-founder of Thepeer. Image source: Supplied\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of innovation going on in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem right now. From people solving problems ranging from identity verification to payments and even vehicle repairs.\n\nHowever, startups still exist in isolation. Take, for instance, a Risevest user trying to fund his plans. Unfortunately, he has no money in his bank account, meaning he can\u2019t deposit money into his Risevest wallet.\n\nSay he has some money in his Piggyvest account, but using it means he has to withdraw the money into his bank account, then transfer it to his Risevest account. I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s a long process. Now, imagine how many transactions are abandoned as a result of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo Nigerian youths, Chike Ononye and Michael (Trojan) Okoh, faced similar challenges, but rather than complain; they decided to provide a solution. The result was Thepeer, a startup building the infrastructure for businesses to share data easily.\n\nFintech giant, Flutterwave, is backing the startup, which launched in August 2021.\n\nGo deeper: Backed by Flutterwave, Thepeer wants to help businesses share data seamlessly using its API\n\nBusha\u2019s seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusha Team\n\nI must have been in my third or final year in the university when I heard about Bitcoin for the first time.

Unlike me, Moyo Sodipo and Michael Adeyeri, Co-founders of Busha, took a chance and invested in Bitcoin.\n\nLike most people, the pair experienced some losses along the way. But, rather than give up, these ex-Jumia and Suregroup employees decided to build a product that simplified the process for newbies.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the bootstrapped startup rose meteorically, with 200,000 registered users and about 1.5 million executed trades. Yesterday, November 23, 2021, Busha announced a seed round of $4.2 million from investors like Jump Capital, Cadenza Ventures, Blockwall Capital, CMT Digital, among others.\n\nHaving seen massive growth in such a short time, Sodipo disclosed that Busha intends to create great customer experiences as it plans to become the go-to platform for Africans looking to exchange cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead more: After bootstrapping for almost three years, Busha raises $4.2m for Africa-wide expansion\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading:\n\nInstagram impacts teen mental health in the West.

          "title": "How lack of local capacity to contain major spills worsens Nembe oil leak",
          "text": "The oil spill at the Santa Barbara oil field, OML 29 located in Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa state has gone uncontained after three weeks because Nigeria lacks the capacity, the head of the government agency combating oil leaks has said.\n\nIdris Musa, director-general of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) said this lack of capacity has seen oil companies invite foreign experts to assist in containing spills, a situation that leads to delay and worsens the spill.\n\nIn an interview with Arise TV on Wednesday, Idris said the 2011 Bonga spill could only be contained because international help came quickly due to Shell\u2019s subscription to a service that cleans oil spills worldwide. In this case, Aiteo, who owns the facility from which the leaks emanated, did not subscribe to the service.\n\n\u201cNow to get a foreign company to render this service, you have to sign contracts, negotiate terms and that will take some time,\u201d said Musa.\n\nThe Bonga oil spill in 2011 reportedly sent over 40,000 barrels of oil into 20 riverine communities across Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa and Delta State in Nigeria. It was only contained with the invitation of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), the largest international industry-funded cooperative which exists to respond to oil spills wherever in the world they may occur.\n\nOSRL which provides preparedness, response and intervention services is wholly owned by most of the environmentally responsible oil and gas companies, with membership representing the majority of global oil production. It currently employs 275 people across 12 locations around the world.\n\nAiteo issued a recent release saying they have engaged experts to assist in managing the spill. So far the company\u2019s spill response team, as well as support from the NOSDRA, has managed to contain the spill from entering neighbouring communities but the main leaks are yet to be stopped.\n\nRead also: Oil firms ignore Nigeria, pump fresh dollars into Libya\n\nThe international team Aiteo is seeking to engage has since visited the site and conducted an aerial survey but the main task of stopping the leaks has not started.\n\nHowever, the task of containing the spill is a tad complicated. According to Musa, the Nembe spill is unusual because it emanated from a non-operational well. The leaks, he said, are coming from the wellhead and so far, the response team has been unable to reach it.\n\n\u201cNobody has gotten to the wellhead, the best you could do is to get close enough until the spill is stopped and nothing is coming out of the well head, then you can take a look and know the reason for the leak,\u201d he said.\n\nThis renders void assumptions about how many barrels of oil may have been spilled.\n\nGiving an insight into volumes of oil that may have leaked into the rivers, he said within eight hours, his team was able to recover 4,105 barrels of oil that had leaked. Over the course of three weeks, it is conceivable that thousands of oil barrels may have leaked from the facility.\n\nOML 29 is predominantly a gas field with less than 20 percent oil hence posing even greater risks as leaking methane is hazardous.\n\n\u201cIt is time we start having the local capacity to contain this kind of spills,\u201d said Musa.\n\nThis poor capacity has worsened oil leaks in recent times. Between 2010 and 2020, Nigeria lost 489,520.301 barrels of oil to leaks according to data from NOSDRA. This is about 40 percent of Nigeria\u2019s estimated current daily production.\n\nIn Ondo, several oil wells were on fire for weeks in 2019 with the country lacking the capacity to put them out.\n\nThe danger to the mangroves, aquatic lives and the livelihoods of the host communities are usually enormous. Musa said it would take between 25 and 30 years for some of the trees to grow and the mangrove to regenerate and provide cover. Communities that depend on fishing will see a significant loss of income as the oil will kill the fishes.\n\nHowever, some of the leaks have occurred due to the negligence of oil companies. The Trans Niger Pipeline (TNP), which belongs to the SPDC JV and carries crude oil from various companies, had over 56 illegal connections by smugglers which were removed last year. There are still 42 illegal connections remaining that the company knows of and is battling to remove. Since 2017, SPDC has removed more than 689 illegal theft points. Illegal theft points are identified by daily inspections from the air and on the ground according to Shell\u2019s briefing notes for 2021.\n\nAccording to the Federal Government, the NNPC spends over 60 Billion yearly maintaining pipelines and other oil infrastructure destroyed by sabotage.\n\nIn the dizzying maze of delta creeks, oil thieves tap pipelines and siphon off crude through rubber hoses that are up to 2 kilometers long into barrels on small vessels. They sail alongside larger vessels and pump the stolen crude into oil tankers bound for exports mostly in Asia.",

          "text": "Nigeria is struggling to attract investment into its energy sector, while Libya, a country that recently emerged from a decade of conflict, is getting serious attention from some of the biggest international oil companies to assist in the gradual revival of its energy space.\n\nFrance\u2019s TotalEnergies SE and Italy\u2019s Eni SpA are making plans to invest $2 billion into Libya\u2019s Waha oil project, which will boost its production by about 100,000 barrels a day.\n\nThe fresh investment is also expected to raise output at Libya\u2019s Mabruk field and help build 500 megawatts of solar power to feed the local grid.\n\n\u201cI want to contribute to Libya\u2019s comeback,\u201d Patrick Pouyanne, TotalEnergies\u2019 CEO, said at this week Libya\u2019s Energy & Economic Summit 2021, the country\u2019s first prominent energy forum in over 10 years.\n\nPouyanne said, \u201cSome may see more boldness than wisdom in TotalEnergies\u2019 decision to partner with Libya. I don\u2019t. Where they see risks, I see the opportunities.\u201d\n\nLibya holds Africa\u2019s biggest oil reserves estimated at 43 billion barrels and 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, but has been mired in fighting for much of the period since 2011, when leader Moammar Qaddafi was toppled in an uprising.\n\nWarring sides struck a truce in mid-2020, leading to more stability and enabling crude output to rise from barely anything to around 1.2 million barrels a day, a tenfold increase from a 121,000bpd average in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nUnlike Libya, Nigeria is punching below its weight in terms of attracting the right kind of investments in its energy sector as foreign investment now accounts for just a fraction of Africa\u2019s biggest economy, with policy uncertainties and security issues also weighing on the mind of overseas investors.\n\n\u201cNigeria may drop further in status as Africa\u2019s biggest producer if the government does not urgently address the situation,\u201d Abiodun Adesanya, the CEO of Lagos-based oil consultancy Degeconek, told S&P Global Platts, noting, \u201cAlready the country has fallen behind Libya in terms of output.\u201d\n\nRead also: Nembe oil spill: FG asks AITEO to halt operation in Bayelsa\n\nNigeria has the capacity to pump around 2.2 million bpd of crude and condensate but in recent months, its output has been languishing below 1.55 million bpd. The country only pumped 1.23 million bpd of crude and 300,000bpd of condensate last month, according to Platts Analytics.\n\nGail Anderson, research director for sub-Saharan Africa at Upstream, believes there are \u201cnot many\u201d takers for the \u201chigh-cost, emissions-intensive assets\u201d that are being disposed of by large oil producers in the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this on the country\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) will likely persist beyond 2021,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nInternational oil companies have been \u201cselling assets mostly in shallow waters\u201d under a process \u201csupported by the Federal Government to support local producers that were perceived as better able to deal with insecurity issues, in particular in the Niger Delta\u201d, Aur\u00e9lien Mali, lead analyst for Africa at ratings agency Moody\u2019s, said.\n\nGlobal oil producer, Shell, is among the big producers that recently kick-started a disinvestment drive from its oil assets in the Niger Delta.\n\nHard hit by the oil spills that have resulted in lawsuits from affected communities in and around the Niger Delta, and insecurity that has culminated in pipeline sabotages, Shell is currently in talks with the government to divest all of its operated joint venture (JV) licences held by its subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), including a 30 percent interest in 19 oil and mining leases (OMLs).\n\nOther large international oil companies disinvesting from Nigeria include Total, which said in January 2021 that it had completed the divestment of its interest in onshore Oil Mining Lease (OML) 17 to the Nigerian company TNOG Oil & Gas. Total operated under a joint venture partnership with Shell and Italian firm Agip Oil Company in the OML 17 \u2014 both of which are also disinvesting from the project.\n\nBeyond lack of investments, a new wave of security threats in Nigeria has emerged that could further dent Nigeria\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cLately, there have been groups in communities in the Niger Delta, who while seeking for cash and attention, have been vandalising oil pipelines,\u201d a Nigeria-based official at a Western oil company said. \u201cDisruption to operations of oil companies in the Niger Delta is rising by the day due to the activities of these vandals.\u201d\n\nThree days ago, a militant group in the Niger Delta region code-named Bayan-Men blew up an oil facility producing about 5,000bpd of condensates operated by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) in Ogba-Egbema-Andoni Local Government Area, Rivers State.\n\nThe angry militants, who destroyed oil well, OB5 (Obiavu-5) in the area, accused the oil firm of failing to deal directly with the host communities, insisting that they were fighting for justice for their people.\n\nThe commander of the Bayan-Men said the company refused to allow the people to benefit from their operations in the area, adding that the firm was neck-deep in divide and rule.\n\n\u201cThe action was because Agip has refused to allow the people to benefit from their operation in the area,\u201d the group said, saying, \u201cMore are still coming if Agip does not engage directly with the communities of Omoku and give them what is due them.\u201d\n\nEni was not immediately available for comment on the incident.",

          "text": "New jobs created in the small-scale retail and trade sectors following COVID-19 pandemic have not been as productive with only a few yielding secure earnings, a recent World Bank report notes.\n\nThe report, titled \u2018COVID-19 in Nigeria: Frontline Data and Pathways for Policy,\u2019 notes that in February 2021, around 26 percent of the working-age population (15 \u2013 64 years) were engaged in retail and trade activities, an apparent increase from 17 percent in January-February 2019.\n\n\u201cThis shift marks a key difference with previous crises in Nigeria, such as the 2016 recession that followed collapsing global oil prices, where agriculture was the sector that expanded as households tried to cope,\u201d the report states.\n\nIt also notes that the general shift towards retail and trade is unlikely to represent an acceleration of structural transformation or a true shift towards more productive work outside of agriculture.\n\nStructural transformation is the transition of an economy from low productivity and labour-intensive economic activities to higher productivity and skill-intensive activities.\n\nIt helps to ensure adequate quantity and quality of employment, equitable distribution of income and wealth, access to quality public services, and protection of the environment.\n\nDeveloped economies like Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, also known as Asian Tigers, are fuelled by exports and rapid industrialisation, thanks to structural transformation.\n\nThese countries have consistently maintained high levels of economic growth since the 1960s, and have collectively joined the ranks of the world\u2019s wealthiest and competitive nations.\n\nBut Africa\u2019s biggest economy is yet to achieve structural transformation as it is still over dependent on oil despite its diversification efforts to non-oil. About 65 percent of Nigerian government revenue still comes from oil, unemployment is at an all-time high of 33 percent and about 90 million Nigerians live in deteriorating poverty.\n\nRead also: How COVID-19 shaped Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis in 5 numbers\n\nAn Abuja-based economic analyst, who wished to be identified as Nosa, said a lot of people lost their jobs and incomes due to the pandemic, and thus in order to survive, they had to go into small-scale retail businesses.\n\n\u201cThe problem with these jobs is that they are not value adding ones because they can\u2019t transform or develop the economy. So, it is highly unlikely for structural transformation to take place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to develop there is a need to restructure the economy from oil into a productive and manufacturing economy,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe report also highlights that the shift towards retail and trade activities is particularly stark among women who rose by 34 percent in February 2021 from 19 percent between January and February 2019, while for men it rose modestly from 14 percent to 17 percent.\n\nAlthough small-scale retail and trade activities are not lucrative, they are easy to start quickly in order to try and supplement household incomes and cope with the economic shock caused by the COVID.\n\nOn types of policies for boosting livelihoods, the bank recommends macroeconomic reforms that spur job creation and structural transformation through exchange rate policies, trade policies, and fiscal policies.\n\nAmong the key priorities to support job creation will be promoting diversification of the economy away from oil, which has represented more than 80 percent of Nigeria\u2019s total exports every year since the 1970s, the report states.\n\nThe report also adds that structural transformation will take decades, so alleviating constraints on small enterprises will be crucial in the short and medium run: for farms.\n\n\u201cThis means developing more resilient crop and livestock varieties and public investment in storage, transport, and market access for non-farm enterprises, alleviating credit constraints could support firm survival, profitability, and growth complementing investment in infrastructure and markets,\u201d the report advises.",

          "text": "Back in March 1995, Berlin in Germany played host to the first \u2018COP\u2019 conference, beginning an annual affair that had continued to capture the imagination of citizens and activists from across the globe.\n\nMore recently, Glasgow hosted the 26th iteration of COP, with this the largest global meeting of its type in history and one that continued the quest to reduce carbon emissions throughout the world.\n\nBut what does COP26 stand for, and what exactly does the conference mean for small businesses?\n\nWhat Does COP 26 Mean?\n\nIn simple terms, COP stands for the \u2018Conference of Parties\u2019, with this describing the single biggest global and annual meeting about climate change.\n\nThis years event, which took place in Glasgow between Sunday 31st October and Friday 12th November, saw every participating country (197 in total) in the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) convene to discuss targets and actions in relation to mitigating the impact of climate change and limiting human interference.\n\nAs the name suggests, this is the 26th COP event, with one having been held every single year since its inception in March 1995.\n\nA key task for the COP is to review the national communications and emissions inventories that are submitted by the parties, before using this data to assess the effectiveness of mitigating measures and the progress made in tackling the core issue of climate change.\n\nWhat Has COP Achieved So Far, and What are the Objectives of COP26?\n\nNot all COPs have been created equal, of course, with some far more generative and productive than others.\n\nFor example, COP3 and COP21 led to two huge global agreements, namely the Kyoto Protocol that created worldwide carbon markets and the 2015 Paris Agreement where countries agreed legally binding and long-term emissions targets.\n\nHowever, this year\u2019s iteration is particularly important and seminal, with this five years on from COP21 and the initial commitment to the Paris Accord. This required all countries to strengthen their climate change commitments every five years, so COP26 is the first acid test of what has been achieved to date.\n\nCertainly, much has been achieved in terms of shifting the attitudes of small and medium-sized businesses, from startups to those listed on trading platforms such as the MT4.\n\nIn the build-up to COP26, thousands of firms committed to eliminating carbon emissions by 2050, primarily by supporting the UN\u2019s Race to Zero campaign.\n\nIn addition to contributing to positive environmental change, such firms can also benefit economically from reducing their carbon emissions. For example, improved sustainability can drive higher growth and profits by attracting a larger number of younger customers, while creating a long-term and sustainable development plan.\n\nThe rise of green finance is also enabling proactive SMEs to grow their ventures sustainably, with this crucial to the achievement of COP26 objectives at the macro level.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Investors in the capital market have been urged to take advantage of initiatives introduced in the capital market which are aimed primarily at strengthening the market and accelerating development.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed stated this at the enlightenment workshop/Investor clinic session with the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning and its agencies in Abuja Wednesday.\n\nThe 10- Year Master Plan initiatives include e-dividend Mandate system, Direct Cash Settlement, Regularisation of Multiple Accounts, National Investors Protection Fund, Recapitalisation of Capital Market Operators and Complaints Management Framework among others.\n\nMrs Ahmed who was represented by Mr. Stephen Okon, Director Home Finance, said the enlightenment program is in line with the commissions\u2019 Capital Market Master Plan and urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect and review the challenges faced by investors with a view of actualizing the objectives of the plan in the remaining few years.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt is worthy to know that the SEC marked out a 10-year plan for development of the Nigerian capital market. The objective is to device strategies for the development of the Nigerian capital market in key areas such as investor protection and integration, professionalism and product innovation and for the expansion of the capital markets role in Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThe SEC deemed it fit to host members of staff of the ministry of finance, budget and national planning and agencies under the ministry in a capital market training procession and workshop with investors.\n\n\u201cThis event is to share knowledge on capital market as well as obtain feedback from such bodies as a medium on exchange of ideas and feedback to SEC on how to continuously improve on the market activities and regulations which is central to Nigeria\u2019s request for implementation and achieving sustainable development.\n\n\u201cI enjoin participants to take advantage of initiatives introduced in the capital market which are aimed primarily at strengthening the market and accelerating development. I wish to congratulate SEC for the foresight and sense of purpose in organizing this workshop\u201d she stated.\n\nIn his opening address, Director General of the SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda said the event which is organised by SEC in collaboration with the Financial Literacy Technical Committee (FLTC) is an annual event coordinated by IOSCO, which it mandates securities regulators globally to commemorate in their respective jurisdictions for the promotion of investor education and protection.\n\nYuguda said as as a member of IOSCO, the SEC is joining the rest of the world to celebrate this important week with planned activities focused on enlightening retail investors on their rights, duties and responsibilities, and educate them on contemporary issues in the Nigerian capital market.\n\nAccording to Yuguda, the Nigerian financial sector is experiencing a resurgence of Ponzi schemes and illegal fund managers, who lure their subscribers by making promises of huge and unjustifiable returns on investment adding that these unlawful schemes have and continued to enjoy the massive patronage of the Nigerian populace and remain a source of concern for regulators in the financial sector.\n\n\u201cThus, the Commission is poised to continue to apply measures and seek the cooperation of relevant stakeholders to combat the activities of these unlawful schemes, which have undermined the reputation of our financial markets and dampened investors\u2019 confidence , among other things.\n\n\u201cThe SEC firmly believes that the Nigerian capital market can attain its potentials if market operators/participants contribute their respective quotas to the growth of the market. The SEC commits to always ensure and manintain an enviroment that is enabled by the appropriate regulatory framework, timely and affordable access to market, zero tolerance for infractions, heightened investor confidence and awareness, innovative product development and good governace practices.\n\n\u201cThere is the need to restore investor confidence and improve the participation of retail investors in the market. The demography of investors in the Nigerian capital market shows that our young population do not participate in the capital market, and only few Nigerians invest in the capital market. This situation creates a huge challenge to the grwoth of our market, and the Commission is striving to change the narrative by instilling a fair, transparant and orderly market, he added.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Nigerian Senate, on Wednesday faulted the federal government\u2019s plan to pay N5,000 each to 40 million Nigerians to cushion the effect of fuel subsidy removal.\n\nWhile the NLC described the proposed N5,000 palliative as comical and will translate to far more than the money government claims to spend currently on fuel subsidy, the Senate said there was no provision for it in the 2022 budget currently before the National Assembly.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Mele Kyari, had on Tuesday announced at a World Bank event in Abuja that petrol would sell for between N320 and N340 per litre from February 2022.\n\nThe current pump price of petrol at filling stations is between N162 and N165/litre, although the product is mostly sold at the upper N165/litre rate due to recent challenges in the downstream oil sector.\n\nThe N165/litre price is basically because the product is being subsidised by the federal government through the NNPC. The NNPC, being the sole importer of petrol into Nigeria for the past four years, has been subsidising the commodity and has been incurring humongous cost as subsidy.\n\nThis development had severely depleted the oil firm\u2019s remittances to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee, hence, reducing the monthly allocations to the three tiers of government consistently.\n\nIf the latest revelation of the NNPC boss that subsidy on petrol would end in February and the price jerked up to N340/litre is anything to go by, then Nigerians would spend about N18.7bn daily for the over 55 million litres of petrol consumed each day across the country, findings have shown.\n\nUsers of petrol would spend about N561bn for the average of 30 days in a month, while in the 12-month period, consumers would pay about N6.732tn.\n\nIn its most recently published monthly operational and financial report, which was for April 2021, the NNPC put the daily petrol consumption in Nigeria at 55.79 million litres.\n\n\u201cTo ensure continuous increased PMS supply and effective distribution across the country, a total of 1.67 billion litres of PMS translating to 55.79 million litres per day were supplied for the month in the downstream sector,\u201d the oil firm stated.\n\nWorking with 55 million litres daily consumption figure and the current price of N165/litre, consumers of petrol are estimated to be currently paying N9.075bn daily and about N277.25bn monthly.\n\nBy increasing the cost of petrol to N340/litre and matching it against the 55 million daily consumption rate, Nigerians would be paying N18.7bn daily for PMS, while their monthly spending would be N561bn.\n\nThis means that the annual fuel consumption bill of Nigerians will be in the region of N6.732tn.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it implies that Nigerians would pay an additional amount of about N283.75bn every month on petrol when the new N340/litre price for PMS comes into effect.\n\nTherefore within a period of 12 months, Nigerians would spend about N3.4tn extra on the current N3.3tn for the purchase of petrol should the Federal Government halt the subsidy regime.\n\nBut the government promised on Tuesday that it had plans to cushion the economic effect of the planned subsidy removal, as it announced plans to replace fuel subsidy with a N5,000 monthly transportation subsidy to the poor.\n\nAccording to her, a monthly transport subsidy in the form of cash transfer of N5,000 will be given to between 30 and 40 million Nigerians.\n\nNLC kicks, says it\u2019s foolish gamble\n\nThe NLC in a statement on Wednesday by its President, Ayuba Wabba, rejected the planned fuel subsidy removal, which it said is cloudy, describing it as a \u2018penny wise pound foolish gamble,\u2019 and a recipe for aggravated hyper-inflation.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018Nigerian workers refuse to take the bait,\u201d the congress said, \u201cThe contemplation by government to increase the price of petrol by more than 200 per cent is a perfect recipe for an aggravated pile of hyper-inflation and astronomical increase in the price of goods and services.\n\n\u201cThis will open a wide door to unintended social consequences such as degeneration of the current insecurity crises and possibly citizens\u2019 revolt. This is not an outcome that any sane Nigeria wishes for.\u201d\n\nWabba said the discussion between the federal government and the World Bank is a monologue, adding that the NLC would continue to insist on its rejection of deregulation based on import-driven model.\n\nThe NLC President said it was difficult to convince Nigerian workers why the country is the only nation among the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries that could not produce its own refined petroleum products and thus adopts the neo-liberal import production model of refined petroleum products.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe wish to reiterate our persuasion that the only benefit of deregulation based on import-driven model is that Nigerian consumers will infinitely continue to pay high prices for refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cThis situation will definitely be compounded by the astronomical devaluation of the naira which currently goes for N560 to US dollars in the parallel market. Thus, any attempt to compare the price of petrol in Nigeria to other countries would be set on a faulty premise as it would be akin to comparing apples to mangoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wish to warn that the bait by government to pay 40 million Nigerians N5,000 as palliative to cushion the effect of astronomical increase in the price of petrol is comical, to say the least.\n\n\u201cThe total amount involved in this queer initiative is far more than the money government claims to spend currently on fuel subsidy. Apart from our concerns on the transparency of the disbursement given previous experiences with such schemes, we are wondering if government is not trying to rob Nigerians to pay Nigerians? Why pay me N5000 and then subject me to perpetual suffering\n\n\u201cClearly, government thoughts on the so-called removal of fuel subsidy is cloudy and appears to be a \u201cpenny wise-pound foolish\u201d gamble. It is clear that the palliative offered by government will not cure the cancer that will befall the mass of our people who suffer the double jeopardy of hype-inflation while their salaries remain fixed.\u201d\n\nSenate disagrees\n\nThe Senate also faulted plans by the federal government to pay N5,000 to 40 million Nigerians as transportation expenses.\n\nSpeaking with journalists on Wednesday after submission of its committee budget proposal, Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Olamilekan Adeola, said that there was no provision for N5,000 monthly grant for 40 million Nigerians for transportation allowance in the 2022 budget currently before the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to him, before the Executive can embark on such intervention, the proposal must come to National Assembly because it is going to cost N2.4 trillion.\n\n\u201cWhat are the criteria that would be used to determine beneficiaries of the transportation allowance?\u201d, he queried.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr Zainab Ahmed, has revealed that with zero remittance from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to the federation, the federal government can no longer sustain petroleum subsidy costs which are currently about N250bn monthly.\n\nAhmed was briefing State House Correspondents on Wednesday after the week\u2019s Federal Executive Council meeting presided over by the President MuhammaduBuhari, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.",

The Governors also sympathised with the people of the State and families of those who died in the unfortunate incident.\n\nThe North-West Governors Forum represented by its chairman and Kastina State Governor, Rt. Hon.

This Empik is the creator of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1, 492,520,325, which will be including 7.5% VAT and a completion period of six months. So that\u2019s the first memoranda,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cThe next one also is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline; the government will be owning not more than 5%. So, 5 per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46% will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51%.\u201d\n\nSirika added that with a 51 per cent share, Nigerians will own the majority while 49% will be held by strategic equity partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years, will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so; I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\n\n\u201cBut one important item is the AU agenda 2063, which speaks to the integration of Africa, which speaks to the cause and trade within Africa that is intra-Africa and to which also another flagship project of AU agenda 2063 called the Single African Air Transport Market.\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d Sirika explained.\n\nThe minister expressed the confidence that the target is \u201cdoable, it\u2019s time-taking, but with aviation, within a year, once the right policy is in place, like SAATM, you can connect Africa and then, of course, the needed integration will happen. Part of AU agenda 2063 so, these are the two memoranda that were submitted, and gladly they were passed by Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name is Nigerian Air which of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to the national debate and 400,000 people participated, choose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website; you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, on or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "title": "2022: Minister reveals full fuel deregulation plans as FG removes subsidy provision from budget",
          "text": "Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Hajiya Zainab Ahmed has said the federal government cannot sustain the current N250 billion monthly petroleum subsidy.\n\nThe minister stated this while briefing State House correspondents Wednesday in Abuja at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nShe said the costly monthly subsidy was making the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC)\u2019s remittance almost zero to the federation.\n\nThe minister\u2019s position came 24 hours after the Group Managing Director Mele Kyari said legally the fuel subsidy regime would come to an end February next year.\n\nMinister speaks\n\nAnd speaking along same line Wednesday, Minister Ahmed said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act has a provision that all petroleum products must be deregulated. And in the 2020 budget, we made a provision to assume that at the maximum by the end of June, we must exit subsidy. So this last FAAC, the subsidy cost to the Federation was N243 billion.\n\n\u201cIf we look at a cost of about 250 billion per month, and it has been increasing consistently. So we\u2019re expecting something around N120 billion per month from NNPC. And now we\u2019re getting to a point where NNPC is remitting near zero. And if we don\u2019t stop we will get to a point where they will tell you pay me this for managing the fuel provision in the country.\n\n\u201cSo if you take N250 billion times 12 months, that is about N3 trillion. If we don\u2019t remove that, that is what it is costing us. This is money that we can use to apply to health and to education.\n\n\u201cThe intervention we want to provide is for between 20 to 40 million people and there is still a lot of work going on. We have a committee that is chaired by His Excellency the Vice President, state governors and a few of us-ministers as members. So we have to have a landing as to the exact number between 20 to 40 million.\n\n\u201cWe already agreed it will be N5, 000 and we have also agreed that the remittances have to be done digitally. So the e-naira will help, but also are the various payment platforms that are currently available. What we will not do is paying people in cash.\n\n\u201cThe transfers that people will receive through one kind of electronic money or the other and it\u2019s meant to be for a period of six, nine or 12 months. So these are things that we are still in negotiation because it\u2019s still money that would have to come from the Federation account. So, everybody that is a member of FAAC will have to agree on the numbers. The maximum will be 12 months, the minimum will be six months,\u201d she said.\n\nGDP report\n\nShe said the third quarter GDP report for 2021 which was released Thursday last week by the National Bureau of Statistics shows an improvement from the contraction that was witnessed in 2020.\n\nAsked why the growth does not impact on Nigerians, she said: \u201cLet me say that, again, the Nigeria economy is growing. And right now, we witnessed four consecutive quarters of GDP growth. We also said that we aspire to continue to push this growth to the point where the growth supersedes the growth in our population, because that\u2019s the time that people will actually feel the benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re pushing the bar at the third quarter of 2021. The average annual growth is now 3.3%. Our population growth is roughly about 3.2%. So, we still need to do a lot more for people to feel this. But the fact that the service sector is not in positive territory, it also means that people will actually begin to feel the difference, because it is the service sector that has the first direct impact on people.\n\n\u201cWe entered into a recession technically and then exited recession by the fourth quarter of 2020. This report shows that we now have four consistent quarters of growth from Q4 2020 to Q3 2021. The GDP third quarter report shows a growth of 4.03% in the third quarter 2021 compared to a contraction of minus 3.62% in the third quarter of last year.\n\n\u201cPart of the economic activities that were the major drivers of growth within this reporting period is services which grew by 8.41%. Growth in the service sector was largely driven by better performance in the rail transport sector, pipeline sector, air transport, financial institutions, road transport sector, water transport as well as crude.\n\n\u201cAgriculture also grew by 1.22%. This is a slight dip compared to the 1.3% in the second quarter of 2021. And the reason for the dip has to do with a slight slowdown in agricultural activities in some parts of the country due to security.\n\n\u201cThe growth in agriculture that is reported in this quarter is largely driven by crop production. The growth in industry has been consistent, but we have seen a slight slowdown compared to the last quarter 2021 and the contraction of the industry is driven by the poor performance of the crude oil and natural gas sectors, coal mining, quarrying, minerals as well as oil refinery.\n\n\u201cThe Q3 GDP report indicates that the oil sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP today stands at 7.49% while the non oil sector contribution to the GDP stands at 2.51%. This indicates that the Nigerian economy is truly very diversified with the oil sector contributing just 7.49%.\n\n\u201cSo, factors that are responsible for this growth include the commitment of the government to continued containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the implementation of fiscal and monetary measures to support businesses contained in the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\n\u201cIt includes the improvement that we\u2019ve witnessed in the rail transport sector, pipelines, air transport, road transport, as well as water transport. It includes improvement in the transportation and the free movement of people as well as goods as the containment measures have been really improved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen also improvement in the financial services sector with higher supplementary incomes compared to 2020. There\u2019s been improvement in electricity generation and distribution during this quarter as well as improvement in water supply, sewage and waste management and remediation activities.\n\n\u201cThere is also indication of higher trade activities which have significantly improved compared to 2020 because of the containment measures that slowed down trade significantly. Also reported is the inflation numbers for the month of October 2021 at 15.99%.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with the decline that we have seen in inflation from April 2021 to date. We expect this decline to continue through the rest of the year and also throughout the year 2022. On the other hand, we have seen an adjustment that has been done in the inflation largely caused by the improvement in the food basket in the inflation mix. And this is largely due to the agricultural harvest which constitutes 50% of the basket and inflation,\u201d she said.\n\nProvision not in budget \u2013Senate\n\nBut, Chairman Senate Committee on Finance Olamilekan Adeola (APC Lagos West) has said no provision was made for N5, 000 monthly stipend for 40 million Nigerians as transportation allowance in the 2022 budget.\n\nPut together, he said this would amount to N2.4trillion.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker also disclosed that there was provision for subsidy in the Appropriation Bill.\n\nHe spoke to journalists Wednesday shortly after submitting the committee\u2019s report on the Bill.\n\nAdeola explained that before the Executive can embark on such intervention, the proposal must come to National Assembly because it is going to cost N2.4 trillion, even as he wondered what criteria would be used to determine the beneficiaries of the transportation allowance.\n\nThe proposal according to him, is still a rumour since the required documents on that is not before the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details, if there is something like that, a document needs to come to National Assembly. And how do they want to identify the identities of the beneficiaries? This is not provided for in 2022 budget proposal which is N2.4 trillion\n\n\u201cFor us, we still believe it is news because this budget we are considering contains subsidy and if we are passing a budget with subsidy in the fiscal document, we can\u2019t speak because that is the document that is currently before us.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance, budget and National Planning was quoted as saying that 40 million Nigerians will be paid N5000 as transportation allowance, in lieu of the fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details for now. I believe that if such proposal is to come to pass, a document to that effect must be sent to National Assembly for us to see how feasible it is and how do we identify the 40 million Nigerians that are going to benefit from this process.\n\n\u201cThere are still a lot of issues to be deliberated upon and looked into if eventually this will come to pass. And how do we raise this money to pay these 40 million Nigerians because I know that even the revenue being raised and monies that are coming in from this so-called oil and other sources of revenue to the Federal government cannot guarantee that?.\n\n\u201cSo, this is not provided for already in the 2022 budget. We don\u2019t have anywhere in the budget where 40 million Nigerians will collect N5000 monthly as transportation allowance totalling N2.4 trillion.\n\n\u201cI know that there must be a budgetary provision for this for us (National Assembly) to consider. That is why I said it is still a news out there until it formally comes to the National Assembly for either a virement to the budget or reordering of the budget. For now, I still want to take it as a rumour and as a news until, it is formally presented before the National Assembly,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s proposed national carrier, Nigeria Air, is set to begin flight operations by April 2022. The new official airline would have 51 per cent of its equity shares owned by the Nigerian government and people, with foreign partners having the remaining 49 per cent.\n\nThe venture is expected to generate 70,000 jobs.\n\nThese were disclosed to newsmen yesterday by Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, at the end of the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.\n\nSirika explained that in the new national carrier, the federal government will have five percent equity shares, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 per cent equity shares, while the expected international strategic partners would have 49 equity shares.\n\nSirika stressed that FEC had given approval for the new national carrier. He said over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name, which was launched in 2018.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cToday (Wednesday) in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. One of the memos is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline: government will be owning not more than five per cent. So five per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46 per cent will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51 per cent.\n\n\u201cIt is 51 per cent majority shareholding by Nigerians and then 49 per cent will be held by strategic equity partner or partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase, which is the next phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so, I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\u201d\n\nSirika noted African Union\u2019s agenda 2063 on the integration of the continent in terms of trade, and another flagship project, the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM).\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air, because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further said, \u201cThe name is Nigerian Air, which, of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to national debate and 400,000 people participated, chose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website, you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, in or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that FEC also approved another memo for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, follow ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in quotation in Europe, because all of the truth of regulation of civilisation will appear on this platform, it\u2019s an extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik are the creators of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1,492,520,325, which will be including 7.5 per cent VAT and completion period of six months.\u201d\n\nEmma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has expressed dissatisfaction with the alleged comment by the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari that the price of petrol could jump as high as N320 and N340 from February 2022.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesay by NLC President Ayuba Wabba, the congress said the proposal by Kyari which he said was consequent on the plans by the federal government to remove subsidy on petrol was rejected.\n\nWabba said the union would maintain its rejection of deregulation so long as it was based on an import-driven model.\n\n\u201cThe response of the Nigeria Labour Congress is that what we are hearing is the conversation of the federal government with neo-liberal international monetary institutions. The conversation between the government and the people of Nigeria especially workers under the auspices of the trade union movement on the matter of fuel subsidy was adjourned sine die so many months ago.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our persuasion that the only benefit of deregulation based on import driven model is that Nigerian consumers will infinitely continue to pay high prices for refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cGiven the nationwide panic that has trailed the disclosure of the monologue within the corridors of government and foreign interests, the Nigeria Labour Congress wishes to posit that it continues to maintain its rejection of deregulation based on import driven model,\u201d he said.\n\nWabba said that the situation would definitely be compounded by the astronomical devaluation of the naira.\n\nHe said the NLC believes that it would be difficult to convince Nigerian workers why the country was the only country among the OPEC member countries that cannot produce its own refined petroleum products and was thus adopting the neo-liberal import production model of refined petroleum products.\n\nWabba also said that any attempt to compare the price of petrol in Nigeria to other countries would be set on a faulty premise as it would be akin to comparing apples to mangoes.\n\n\u201cThe contemplation by government to increase the price of petrol by more than 200 per cent is a perfect recipe for an aggravated pile of hyper-inflation and astronomical increase in the price of goods and services.\n\n\u201cThis will open a wide door to unintended social consequences such as degeneration of the current insecurity crises and possibly citizens\u2019 revolt. This is not an outcome that any sane Nigeria wishes for,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that federal government should consider some of the viable options which NLC feels can help.\n\nThe options suggested by NLC includes; insulating the domestic consumers from the market pressure brought about by the free fall of the Naira by making arrangement with contiguous refineries not far from Nigeria to swap crude oil with refined petroleum products; accelerating work on the rehabilitation of Nigeria\u2019s four major refineries which are all currently operating at near zero installed capacity; and establishing empirical data on the quantity of refined petroleum products consumed daily by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that this record remains a myth and a huge crater for all manner of official sleaze and leakages in the downstream petroleum sub-sector of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, the NLC president said the argument that the complete surrender of the price of petrol to market forces would normalize the curve of demand and supply was wrong, given the current market realities with cooking gas, diesel and kerosene.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that these commodities which Nigeria can easily produce have been priced out of the reach of most Nigerian families with majority of our people resorting to tree felling and charcoal for their energy needs.\n\n\u201cFinally, we wish to warn that the bait by government to pay 40 million Nigerians N5000 as palliative to cushion the effect of astronomical increase in the price of petrol is comical, to say the least.\n\n\u201cThe total amount involved in this queer initiative is far more than the money government claims to spend currently on fuel subsidy. Apart from our concerns on the transparency of the disbursement given previous experiences with such schemes, we are wondering if government is not trying to rob Nigerians to pay Nigerians? Why pay me N5000 and then subject me to perpetual suffering?\n\n\u201cClearly, government thoughts on the so-called removal of fuel subsidy is cloudy and appears to be a \u201cpenny wise-pound foolish\u201d gamble.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the palliative offered by government will not cure the cancer that will befall the mass of our people who suffer the double jeopardy of hype-inflation while their salaries remain fixed.\n\n\u201cAs we had done several times, we call on the federal government to consider various options that can help Nigeria navigate out of the quagmire constructed by the failure of successive governments to embrace developmental governance and accountable leadership.\u201d\n\nEmma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "No Provision in 2022 Budget as Finance Minister Ahmed Says N5,000 Transport Grant for Vulnerable Nigerians to Last One Year \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, on Wednesday shed more light on the proposed N5,000 monthly transportation grant the federal government plans to give poor Nigerians after the removal of fuel subsidy by June next year.\n\nAccording to the minister, who spoke to newsmen after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja, the allowance would last for a duration of 12 months.\n\nBut the Senate on Wednesday faulted the move by the government, saying the 2022 appropriation bill under consideration by the legislature does not make provision for the N5, 000 monthly transportation stipend for 40 million Nigerians being contemplated by the federal government next year.\n\nSpeaking further, Ahmed explained: \u201cHow long will this intervention last? Okay, six months to 12 months. And we\u2019re saying the committee is still working. So, we\u2019ll know on Monday, how long, how much and then the procedure on a state by state basis\u201d.\n\nShe also justified the basis for the transport allowance saying: \u201cGovernment is providing the support and support is to augment what the families already have. We wish we can do more. But we\u2019re also limited in terms of the maximum of what government can afford. But there nothing\u2019s stopping the states to add more than the N5,000 that is going to come from the federation.\n\n\u201cSo, some states might decide to do more where they can afford it. The federal government right now is just looking, under this committee looking at N5000 per month.\u201d\n\nAhmed, whilr speaking on the third quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 2021 figures released last Thursday by the National Bureau of Statistics, emphasised that the numbers showed an improvement from the contraction that the nation witnessed in 2020.\n\nShe, however, stressed that the effect of the present administration\u2019s economic growth would not be felt until GDP growth surpasses population growth rate.\n\nOn why economic growth recorded does not impact Nigerians, Ahmed said: \u201cLet me say that, again, the Nigerian economy is growing. And right now we witnessed, four consecutive quarters of GDP growth. We also said that we aspire to continue to push this growth to the point where the growth supersedes the growth in our population, because that\u2019s the time that people will actually feel the benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re pushing the bar at the third quarter of 2021. The average annual growth is now 3.3 per cent. Our population growth is roughly about 3.2 per cent. So, we still need to do a lot more for people to feel this. But the fact that the service sector is not in positive territory, it also means that people will actually begin to feel the difference, because it is the service sector that has the first direct impact on people.\n\n\u201cThe Q3 GDP report indicates that the oil sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP today stands at 7.49 per cent while the non-oil sector contribution to the GDP stands at 2.51 per cent. This indicates that the Nigerian economy is truly diversified.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, said he presented a memo to the cabinet for approval for the award of contract for the provision of training logistics, operational equipment and maintenance support for government equipment and personnel, under the Integrated National Surveillance and Waterways Protection Solution Infrastructure in Nigeria.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThis is also what we call the Deep Blue Project. That\u2019s the project that the president launched some months ago, around May or June.\n\n\u201cThe contract was awarded at N6,347,967,644.21, inclusive of 7.5% VAT for a period of two years. It\u2019s also important to say that the cabinet was briefed that there\u2019s huge improvement in the security on our waterways now and we hope that it will continue as we progress.\u201d\n\nBefore the commencement of the council meeting, President Buhari led cabinet members to wish his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari a happy 77th birthday celebration.\n\nThis followed an announcement to that effect by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha of Gambari\u2019s birthday.\n\nPresident Buhari congratulated Gambari on the attainment of age 77, and jocularly said \u201cyou are still going strong, congratulations!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate declared that the 2022 appropriation bill does not make provision for N5,000 monthly transportation stipend for 40 million Nigerians being contemplated by federal fovernment next year.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after submission of its Committee budget proposal, Chairman of Senate Committee on Finance , Senator Olamilekan Adeola said there was no provision for N5000 monthly for 40 million Nigerians for transportation allowance in the 2022 proposed budget currently before the National Assembly.\n\nHe added that before the Executive could embark on such intervention the proposal must come to National Assembly because it was going to cost N2.4 trillion.\n\nHe wondered what criteria to be used to determine the beneficiaries of the transportation allowance.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details, if there is something like that a document needs to come to National Assembly and how do they want to identify the identity of the beneficiaries, this is not provided for in 2022 budget proposal which is N2.4 trillion.\n\n\u201cFor us we still believe it is a fake news because this budget we are considering contains subsidy and if we are passing a budget with subsidy in the fiscal document, we can\u2019t speak because that is the document that is currently before us.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning was quoted as saying that 40 million Nigerians will be paid N5000 as transportation allowance, in lieu of the fuel subsidy. I don\u2019t want to go into details for now.\n\n\u201cI believe that if such proposal is to come to pass, a document to that effect must be sent to National Assembly for us to see how feasible this is and how do we identify the 40 million Nigerians that are going to benefit from this process.\n\n\u201cThere are still a lot of issues to be deliberated upon and looked into if eventually this will come to pass and how do we raise this money to pay these 40 million Nigerians because I know that even the revenue being raised and monies that are coming in from this so called oil and other sources of revenue to the federal government.\n\n\u201cSo, this is not provided for already in the 2022 budget.

That is why I said it is still a news out there until it is formally come to the National Assembly for either a virement to the budget or reordering of the budget. For now, I still want to take it as a rumour until, it is formally presented before the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Senate yesterday flayed alleged secret employment ongoing in the civil service despite claims that the federal government had placed embargo on job placement.\n\nIt\u2019s Committee on Federal Character and Inter- Governmental Affairs, however, stressed that government should as a matter of urgency ensure recruitment of eligible Nigerians into public service.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Senator Danjuma La\u2019ah, who spoke while submitting the report of the committee to the Senate Appropriation Committee challenged the federal government to come out with evidence on job embargo while standing his ground that top civil servants engaged in secret job placement.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cMany people are being secretly employed but those in charge are claiming that there is embargo on employment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where they got that from. We have been asking them. The president has not opened his mouth to say that there is embargo on employment.\n\n\u201cThere is no embargo anywhere but some of the officials of government are so myopic that they decide to take advantage of the situation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe discovered that young Nigerians who graduated from higher institutions some 15 years ago had yet to gain employment. The development had aggravated insecurity all over the places including insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and other criminal activities.\u201d\n\nHe demanded that federal government should step up process of employment to engage millions of Nigerians.\n\nEmma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Cause of Nembe Oil Spill Yet to Be Determined, FG Says",
          "text": "Three weeks after a pipeline explosion in Nembe, Bayelsa State, which led to oil spillage across 45 communities in the South-South Nigerian state, the federal government, on Wednessday, said it was yet to establish the cause of the eruption. It frowned on speculations that the explosion might be an act of sabotage.\n\nThe federal government also denied reports that the country lost over 200,000 barrels of oil to the spillage, which had not been contained since the explosion on November 1.\n\nDirector General/Chief Executive Officer, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, who spoke on Wednesday on ARISE \u201cMorning Show,\u201d said no one has been able to access the wellhead to determine what exactly happened.\n\nA delegation sent by President Muhammadu Buhari to assess the oil spill at the Santa Barbara, South-west oilfield on Wednesday promised to ensure speedy redress of the situation.\n\nSimilarly, Halliburton Co., one of the world\u2019s largest oil services companies, confirmed that one of its units had been hired to help seal a wellhead that had been spewing its contents for several weeks in the Niger Delta.\n\nMusa said the rescue teams on ground had so far recovered 4,105 barrels of oil since the Nembe oil spill began.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is absolutely wrong and preposterous for people to make false speculations over the oil spillage in Nembe communities of Bayelsa State. As I speak, nobody has been able to reach the oil wellhead, where the flow is coming from.\n\n\u201cThe best that was achieved by the joint investigation teams was to get close to the source, but nobody has been able to reach the actual source of the flow. It is only when the team will be able to reach the source that they can determine the possible cause of the oil spill. It is only when they get to the source of the leakage that they will know whether the leakage was caused by broken pipe or corrosive pipe or loosed nuts.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the cause of the oil spill could only be verified by facts and not by speculations and simulations.\n\n\u201cSo the cause of the oil spill is unknown at the moment, until a time when we are able to get to the source, which is the actual oil wellhead from where the leakage is coming from,\u201d Musa said.\n\nMusa also said, \u201cOne can only estimate the volume of oil that can be produced from any given oil wellhead when such oil wellhead is active and operational, but it is not possible to estimate the volume of loss of oil from an oil well, when there is leakage.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong for people to use simulation method to determine loss of oil from a leaked oil well. We must talk about facts.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that the oil wellhead has been abandoned for years and cannot therefore be compared to oil wellhead that is active and operational.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to project that 200,000 barrels of oil have been lost since November 1, 2021, when the spill started. From the on-going recovery process, about 4, 105 barrels of oil have been recovered as at Tuesday this week, which is based on eight hours working time on a daily basis since the spill started, but that is not to say that was the total oil that spilled so far.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cIt is not the responsibility of NOSDRA to regulate abandoned oil wellheads, because it is under the regulation of the Nigerian Offstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission. The commission had a number of times, planned to decommission abandoned oil wells, but they still surface.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said the concern of government now was not the volume of oil loss, but the communities that the oil spill was affecting.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware that the rivers and streams where the oil is flowing into will likely affect the lives of the living creatures in the rivers and streams, including the trees, and the rivers and streams are sources of livelihood for the community,\u201d Musa added.\n\nReacting to claims that NOSDRA had not been in control of the area since the oil spill started on November 1, Musa said, \u201cI want to correct the erroneous notion that NOSDRA has been incapacitated and has not done anything since the oil spillage on November 1, 2021. When the oil spill started, it was immediately reported and NOSDRA has been on the matter right from the onset.\n\n\u201cThe Nembe oil spill is a different one from what had been happening in the past, because the initial joint investigation team that visited the scene, which NOSDRA was part of, could not access the oil well from where the spill is coming from, because of the magnitude of the force of the flow of oil, which has stretched out into several communities in the state.\u201d\n\nMusa said the first thing NOSDRA did was to ask the oil company to begin oil recovery process, since the oil spill could not be stopped immediately. He said it was later discovered that Nigerian engineers could not stop the oil spillage, which compelled government to contact international oil companies to come and help stop the flow. He added that it took some process and time, which caused some delay in addressing the situation.\n\nGoing forward, Musa said Nigeria needed to develop local human capacity that could handle such disaster.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe reason is to avoid delay in addressing future occurrence. For instance, the international oil experts that were contacted came and surveyed the area and returned back to analyse their findings. They just returned, and this has caused a lot of delay in stopping the oil leakage. With the return of the oil exploration experts, operations to stop the oil flow from its source started yesterday and by the time it is addressed, we will begin the remediation and recovery processes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a federal government delegation led by Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, which visited communities affected by the spillage, told the people of Nembe that the president was seriously concerned about the leak and had instructed relevant government agencies to take appropriate actions to bring the situation under control.\n\nDuring the on-the-spot assessment, which was meant to get a first-hand account of the magnitude of the spillage that occurred at an Aiteo Eastern Exploration Company (AEEPCO) facility in the area, Sylva lamented the incessant degradation of the Niger Delta environment.\n\nThe minister was joined on the inspection by Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Engr Gbenga Komolafe; the traditional ruler of Opu-Nembe Kingdom, His Royal Highness King Biobelemoye Josiah; and House of Representatives member representing Brass/Nembe Constituency, Mr. Israel Adi.\n\nSylva said, \u201cMr President is very concerned about the spill, that is why he sent me to come and have on the spot assessment of the situation. He feels the pains of the people and wants urgent steps taken to address the problem.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that the spill was a serious environmental concern that needed urgent measures to contain, noting that the government would do all within its powers to tackle the environmental problem.\n\n\u201cSo much damage has been done to the environment in the Niger Delta and the government is very much concerned about this situation and would not allow further degradation of the environment, that why the government will take urgent measures to tackle the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe disclosed that the relevant agencies had already been deployed in the area to tackle the oil spill adding, \u201cWe will need to bring in support to help us clean up the spill.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Basambri community after inspecting the spill site, Sylva said it was important for him to come to see things for himself to ensure that there was no problem between the oil company and the community.\n\nHe conveyed the president\u2019s regrets over the spill and noted, \u201cPresident Buhari will ensure that the situation is immediately remediated.\u201d\n\nAddressing the community, Komolafe said they were in Basambri on the instructions of the president to see things for themselves. He noted that as regulators in the upstream sector of the economy, the commission would ensure that operators operate within acceptable international standards that will impact positively on the lives of the people in the oil producing communities.\n\nAiteo on November 5 reported a major oil leak from its Oil Mining Lease (OML) 29, in Nembe.\n\nAiteo acquired the Oil Mining Lease (OML) 29 following the 2015 divestment by Shell. The well was acquired for $2.4 billion and consists of the 97km Nembe Creek trunk line, which evacuates crude from onshore oil wells within the oil bloc and other operators to Bonny Export Terminal.\n\nAiteo, in a statement signed by its Media Contact, Mr Matthew Ndiana, explained that aside urgent possible technical responses to contain the leak, it had sought the collaboration of Clean Nigeria Associates (CNA), which had since mobilised to site.\n\nWhile pointing out that the company had deployed its internal resources to reinforce containment and recovery efforts, Aiteo said that \u201cwell killing\u201d assessment site visit had been carried out to evaluate the assets and earmark the resources required to bring the effusion under control.\n\nIn a related development, Halliburton, the Houston-based firm\u2019s Boots & Coots unit, has been called in by independent producer Aiteo Eastern E&P Co., to contain the leak from a non-producing well in the southern Bayelsa State, a spokeswoman confirmed to Bloomberg by email yesterday.\n\nOil has been leaking \u201cunder high pressure\u201d since November 1, according to a statement yesterday, by Nigerian advocacy group, Environmental Rights Action (ERA), which visited the site on Sunday.\n\nThe rupture on the field located in mangrove forests has been releasing crude into the surrounding river, and fumes into the air.\n\nThe field produced about 27,000 barrels per day in 2020, according to information published by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The output, which had dropped to about 9,500 barrels a day by July, is transported via a pipeline to Shell\u2019s Bonny export terminal.\n\nEmma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
