          "text": "Malaysia\u2019s embattled leader will offer his resignation to the king Monday, a minister said, potentially spelling an end to his 17-month-old government and plunging the country into fresh turmoil.\n\nPrime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has faced mounting pressure to step aside after losing his parliamentary majority, and over his administration\u2019s handling of a worsening coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHe made a last-ditch attempt to cling to power Friday by urging opposition MPs to support him in exchange for institutional reforms \u2014 but his offer was rejected.\n\nMinister Mohamad Redzuan Yusof told AFP that Muhyiddin informed lawmakers from his party during a meeting in Kuala Lumpur Sunday that he would tender his resignation.\n\n\u201cHe will hold a final cabinet meeting on Monday, then he will head to the palace to submit his resignation letter,\u201d said the minister in the prime minister\u2019s department.\n\n\u201cWe did try to convince him to stay on, but he said: \u2018We do not have the number of MPs.'\u201d\n\nMuhyiddin told the meeting it would be up to the king \u2014 who has publicly criticised his government \u2014 to accept his resignation or not, the minister added.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s constitutional monarch formally appoints the candidate whom he believes commands majority support in parliament as premier.\n\nThere has been speculation that, should he step down, a new government will be formed without elections due to concerns that polls could worsen the virus outbreak.\n\nRead Also\n\nBut, with no clear successor as prime minister, there are likely to be days of political horse-trading ahead as MPs seek to form a workable coalition.\n\nMuhyiddin came to power in March last year without an election at the head of a scandal-plagued coalition following the collapse of a two-year-old, reformist government led by Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nBut his government was beset by turmoil from day one \u2014 it had weak parliamentary support, its legitimacy was constantly questioned, and Muhyiddin faced a serious challenge from opposition chief Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nPressure mounted after a group of MPs from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the biggest party backing Muhyiddin, publicly withdrew support.\n\nThe leader claimed some among them were angered because he refused to use his position to influence corruption cases against them.\n\nThis includes former prime minister Najib Razak, who was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in jail last year over the multi-billion-dollar 1MDB scandal. He is free on bail while appealing.\n\nJames Chin, a Malaysia expert from the University of Tasmania, warned a change of government could impact their cases.\n\n\u201cNajib and others facing corruption charges will not face any time in jail as long as UMNO are in the new government,\u201d he said.\n\n(AFP)",

          "text": "By Ibrahim Wuyo & Emmanuel Elebeke\n\nCondolence messages have continued to pour in following the death of Alhaji Ahmed Joda, one of the top federal civil servants who served in the 60s and fondly called \u2018Super Perm Secretaries\u2019.\n\nJoda died on Friday at the age of 91.\n\nThe latest tributes came from Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) and Northern Speakers Forum.\n\nPatriot, great public servant \u2014 ACF\n\nIn its message, ACF said Joda was an honest, but firm public servant. \u201cWith his death, Nigeria has lost a great civil servant and patriot,\u201d the Forum said.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, Arewa Consultative Forum, Emmanuel Yawe, in a statement said \u201cJoda was, until his death, the pillar on which the Northern Region and Nigeria relied in times of turbulence.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn 1967, Joda was appointed a Federal Permanent Secretary from the Northern Regional Service. He was one of the permanent secretaries who gave patriotic advise leading to the survival of Nigeria during the national crisis that led to the civil war. For the influence they had on General Yakubu Gowon, the then Head of State, he and others were nicknamed \u2018Super Permanent Secretaries\u2019..\n\n\u201cAs an experienced technocrat and elder statesman, he was often called upon to bail and infact did bail Nigeria out of many tight corners. He did so when General Obasanjo was to hand over power to Alhaji Shehu Shagari who won the Presidential elections in 1979. He was appointed to head the transition committee at the time. In 2015, when President Goodluck Jonathan lost elections to Muhammadu Buhari he was again called upon to head another transition committee that led to the peaceful transition from Jonathan to Buhari.\n\n\u201cThe late Ahmed Joda was a calm and honest, soft spoken but firm public servant. In his death, Nigeria has lost a great civil servant and patriot. We condole with his immediate family, Adamawa State and the Federal Government over this great loss and pray Almighty God will give him peaceful rest, forgive his mistakes and console the loved ones he left behind\u201d, the Forum said.\n\nNCC mourns\n\nOn its part, NCC commiserated with the family of the deceased, a former Chairman, Board of Commissioners of the Commission.\n\nIn a message, the Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, the Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC. Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, on behalf of the NCC described the late Joda, as an irreparable loss to the nation.\n\nHe said Joda was \u201ca nation builder, a consummate statesman, an administrator per excellence, and a dedicated philanthropist.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, the deceased will be remembered for the legacy and foundation he laid as the Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission for a decade. \u201cThe Board, under Joda\u2019s 10 years chairmanship, set the tone and foundation for the digital revolution in Nigeria, which has positioned the sector as a major contributor and enabler to overall socio-economic and political transformation in the country till date\u201d, he said.\n\nBorn in Yola in 1930, Alhaji Joda was a retired first class Federal Permanent Secretary, who served as the Chairman, Board of Commissioners of NCC for ten years, commencing from 2001 when the commercial launch of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) service started in Nigeria.\n\nThe Board under Joda\u2019s 10 years chairmanship, set the tone and foundation for the digital revolution in Nigeria, which has positioned the sector as a major contributor and enabler to overall socio-economic and political transformation in the country till date.\n\nThe late Joda was a recipient of multiple national and international honours and other prestigious awards, recognizing his outstanding performance and contributions to the development of Nigeria.\n\nNigeria has lot a stabilizer, Kaduna Speaker\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman, Northern Speakers Forum and Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Yusuf Ibrahim Zailani, described the demise of Joda as a huge loss not just to Adamawa State where he hailed from, but to the entire country.\n\nIn a statement by Zailani by Ibrahim Dahiru Danfulani, SA Media and Publicity, to journalists in Kaduna, he said the late Alhaji Joda was a stabilizer, who has for decades contributed to the peace and progress of the country,\u201d Zailani said.\n\nThe Kaduna Speaker said that although, he rarely spoke, he worked silently behind the scenes, promoting peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cHe was indeed a rare gem and will be missed not just by those whose paths had cross his, but our dear country Nigeria. His wealth of wisdom, humility and peaceful nature was a rate virtue, which the country needs o really dig deep to find a replacement\u201d, he said.\n\nHe therefore, extended condolences to President Muhammadu Buhari, government and the people of Adamawa State.\n\n\u201cWe will all miss him.

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto urgently redirect the proposed spending of N4.8bn of public money to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages of Nigerians and other people, to pay some of the salaries of striking resident doctors, improve their benefits, as well as improve public healthcare facilities for the sake of poor Nigerians who rely on those facilities, and have nowhere else to turn.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cWe also urge you to send to the National Assembly a fresh supplementary appropriation bill, which reflects the redirected budget, for its approval.\u201d\n\nIn the open letter dated 14 August, 2021, and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization said: \u201cRedirecting the proposed spending of N4.8bn would be entirely consistent with your constitutional oath of office, and the letter and spirit of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], as it would promote efficient, honest, and legal spending of public money.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cRedirecting the proposed spending of N4.8bn would also remove the threats to fundamental human rights of Nigerians, and ensure access to quality healthcare for the socially and economically vulnerable people who rely on public hospitals, and have no opportunity for medical treatment elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cAny appropriation law ought to comply with the Nigerian Constitution and the country\u2019s international human rights obligations and commitments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe constitutional oath of office implicitly provides some safeguards on the appropriation and spending of public funds, and imposes a legally binding obligation on public officers to preserve the public money, and not to disburse it except conformably to the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP believes that any proposed spending of public funds should stay within the limits of constitutional responsibilities, and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mere threat of mass surveillance, even when secret, coupled with the lack of remedy, can constitute an interference with human rights, including the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed spending of N4.8bn of public funds as contained in the Supplementary Appropriation Act, which you signed last month would give rise to serious violations of the human rights of Nigerians and other people, as it would grant free rein to government agencies to conduct mass surveillance of communications of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed spending also fails to meet the requirements of public interests, legality, necessity, and proportionality.

Troops immediately mobilized to the scene and restored normalcy.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari meets Tinubu in London\n\n\u201cSome persons, including commuters, lost their lives in the unfortunate incident while others with varying degree of injuries have been evacuated to a medical facility for care. Their condition is being closely monitored. 12 suspects have so far been arrested in connection with the incident and troops are on the trail of others who took part in perpetrating the heinous act. Those arrested are currently in custody for interrogation.\n\n\u201cThe Commander, Operation SAFE HAVEN, Major General Ibrahim Ali, appealed to the people to volunteer credible information that would lead to the arrest of other suspects currently at large. General Ali also appealed for calm and urged law abiding citizens to continue with their lawful activities without any fear of intimidation. Meanwhile, security patrols have been stepped-up in Jos Metropolis to maintain peace and security.\u201d\n\nTrouble makers\n\nLalong, on his part, warned \u201ctrouble makers bent on fomenting trouble in Plateau State to desist as the Government will not allow any form of lawlessness to disrupt the peace of the State.\u201d\n\nHe condemned the act and immediately directed security agencies to swiftly identify and arrest the perpetrators while dominating the area to restore calm.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on innocent citizens no matter their backgrounds will never be tolerated in Plateau State and those who are found to be behind such attacks will be dealt with decisively to serve as deterrence and restore public order,\u201d the governor said in a statement.\n\nCase of mistaken identity\n\nA statement by Akeredolu\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, in Akure, Ondo State capital, said the attack was \u201ca case of mistaken identity\u201d.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cOndo State Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, just a few hours ago, received the unfortunate report of the Plateau State tragedy where some people believed to be indigenes of Ondo State were attacked.\n\n\u201cAn unconfirmed number of deaths are believed to have been recorded while some are severely injured in the said attack. Their true identity will soon be unraveled.\n\n\u201cThe Governor says from report he received from his brother Governor in Plateau, the incident was a case of mistaken identity.\n\n\u201cThe victims, according to preliminary reports, took a route where crisis between Muslims and Northern Christians had ensued for some time, and that they may have been possibly, mistaken for aggressors. \u201cAccordingly, either of the two feuding groups in the area could be responsible in this regard.\n\n\u201cGovernor Akeredolu hereby calls for calm among the people of the state, urging that nobody should take law into their hands.\n\n\u201cHe particularly, urges the people to refrain from any hasty colouration of the unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cI have spoken with my brother Governor in Plateau, and he has assured me that the situation is under control.\n\n\u201cI want to plead with our people to remain calm. From the report I gathered, it is clear some were killed while many others who are injured have been taken to the hospital for medical attention.\n\n\u201cLet me again, make it clear that I was informed by my colleague that it was indeed, a case of mistaken identity. I want to assure our people living in Plateau that they are not targets of any religion or ethnic crisis.\n\n\u201cWhile assuring that justice will be served, I want to plead again that we do not take law into our hands. Let us remain calm.\n\n\u201cI also want to commiserate with the family of all those who have lost their lives in this unfortunate incident. We mourn the departed and feel the pains of their loved ones\u201d.\n\nThe governor assured indigenes of Ondo living outside the state of his commitment to their safety.\n\nPresidency condemns attacks on travellers\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency, last night, condemned the Plateau attack, disclosing, that the travellers, from a religions event in Bauchi, were passing through Jos, and regreted the reported deaths of at least twenty-two persons with several others injured in that ambush on their travelling party\u201d.\n\nThe condemnation was contained in a statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cIt is widely known that Plateau State has been one of the states affected by herder-farmer clashes, which have, in a significant way, been curtailed following the intense peace-building efforts of the administration of Governor Simon Lalong.\n\n\u201cHowever, to be clear, this is not an agriculturalist-on-pastoralist confrontation \u2013 but rather a direct, brazen and wickedly motivated attack on members of a community exercising their rights to travel freely and to follow the faith of their choosing.\n\n\u201cWith the evident preparedness of their attackers, it is clear this was a well-conceived and prearranged assault on a known target, location and religious persuasion of the travellers not an opportunist ambush\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has called for the immediate rounding up of all members of the alleged Christian militia that reportedly killed 22 unarmed Muslim travellers in Rukuba, Jos, Plateau State, on Saturday.\n\nDAILY POST reported yesterday that there were skirmishes on Saturday morning at Rukuba road area of Jos North LGA of Plateau State, which claimed many lives and left several others injured.\n\nReports say that 23 of those attacked lost their lives while 23 persons sustained injuries and are currently receiving treatment. 26 others were said to have been rescued unhurt.\n\nSo far, 20 suspects have been arrested and security agencies are conducting investigations to get to the bottom of the matter.\n\nAnd MURIC, in a statement signed by its Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, and issued to reporters on Saturday evening called for the immediate arrest of everyone involved in the attack.\n\n\u201cTwenty two (22) unarmed Muslim travellers were brutally killed by a Christian militia group at Rukuba, Jos, Plateau State, today, Saturday, 14th August, 2021,\u201d MURIC claimed.\n\nMURIC further claimed that the Muslims had attended the annual dhikr prayer in Bauchi State and were returning to Ikare, Ondo State, when they were waylaid by the notorious Irigwe Christian militia.\n\nMURIC, therefore condemned the massacre, describing it as barbaric, and demanded the rounding up of all members of the Irigwe Christian militia.\n\n\u201cThey must be brought to justice. They ran away from the crime scene when they saw security men approaching. But they had participated in the killing of twenty two (22) and wounding of fourteen (14) before taking to their heels.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible for the six who were arrested to have been the only attackers. Only six attackers could not have surrounded people who filled five buses. The rest must be fished out.\n\n\u201cWe reject the crocodile tears and lies of Governors Lalong of Jos and Akeredolu of Ondo State who claimed that the attack was a case of mistaken identity.\n\n\u201cThis excuse is the first sign of executive conspiracy. It is a shame that Akeredolu will trivialise the massacre of citizens of his own state simply because the victims happen to be Muslims. #Muslimlivesmatter.\n\n\u201cHow can anybody say Muslims from Ikare in Ondo State were killed in such a large number due to \u2018mistaken identity\u2019? That is balderdash. It is unthinkable. Who do the Christian terrorists have the right to attack and kill for their pleasure and who should they spare? This kind of excuse has exposed the mentality of the two governors. They are shedding crocodile tears,\u201d the group said.\n\nAccording to MURIC, state Governor, Simon Lalong\u2019s body language is making it difficult for Muslims to trust him just as the Islamic human rights group alleged an attempt to sweep the killings under the carpet, \u201cbecause his kinsmen are the culprits and he has a history of covering up their crimes.\u201d\n\nMURIC said that the killing of General Alkali was still fresh in its memory, alleging an attempt to cover up the act.\n\nMeanwhile, Lalong has imposed a curfew from 6pm to 6am in Jos North, Bassa and Jos South LGAs of the state until further notice.\n\nHe said he had received briefings on the situation from the relevant heads of security agencies and had monitored the unfolding scenario.\n\nHe said his government was concerned about the persisting tensions and attempts by some persons to take the laws into their hands by threatening to attack individuals and private facilities, as well as public property.\n\nLalong said that In order to avoid further security breaches and to protect lives and properties of citizens, he has decided to impose a curfew on the affected areas.\n\nAccording to him, movement in the affected area shall remain restricted subject to further review by his Security Council.",

          "title": "UN September protest: Yoruba nation, Biafra agitators flee Nigeria",
          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nIndications have emerged that some leading figures of self-determination groups may have fled from the country following alleged plot by the Federal Government to clamp down on them ahead of the planned \u2018One Million March\u2019 slated for September 14 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, USA.\n\nSunday Sun reliably gathered during the week that self-determination groups in the country uncovered a surreptitious plan by the government to embark on massive arrests of key figures of the groups ahead of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA, which holds from September 14 to 21.\n\nA notable supporter of Oodua Nation who craved anonymity told Sunday Sun that the alleged move by the government was aimed at throwing spanner into the entire arrangements by self-determination groups to appear at the United Nations headquarters with a view to pressing home the groups\u2019 demand for a referendum to decide on the rights to self-determination of the people.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201dsince the secret plan by the government to arrest prominent supporters among the self-determination groups in order to bungle the groups\u2019 presentations at the United Nations was uncovered, leading figures that are key to the presentation have been leaving the country ahead of time,\u201d the source revealed.\n\nThe source also noted that the government was shocked to realise that the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and the attempt to get the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, out of circulation are yet to yield desired results of suppressing the clamour for self-determinations by the groups. So, their next plan is to embark on massive crackdown of other known figures within the groups.\n\n\u201cIt has now dawned on them that the proponents of Oodua Nation and Biafra really mean business because of the way these groups have carried on with their demand for freedom despite the clampdown on the leaders of the groups,\u201d the source said.\n\nReports had claimed that Ilana Omo Oodua would be making an official presentation at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA, on the need to convince the world organisation for a separate and independent Yoruba nation, a development, the source said, might have jolted the government into plotting to disorganize the groups\u2019 move at getting the much-sought international attention.\n\nBut a statement released by the Communication Manager of the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination, NINAS, the umbrella body of leading regional self-determination groups in the South and Middle Belt of Nigeria, Maxwell Adeleye, indicated that the group would not be making an official presentation at the United Nations General Assembly. Rather, it stated that NINAS was currently perfecting plan to stage a \u2018One Million March\u2019 during the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly billed for 14 to 21 September 14 to 21.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe wish to say very expressly that Ilana Omo Oodua, contrary to media reports, will not be making any official presentation at UNGA\n\n\u201cWhat will be happening at UNGA is that the members of Ilana Omo Oodua under the leadership of Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye alongside other members of NINAS from the Lower Niger and Middle Belt of Nigeria will be holding a \u2018One Million March\u2019 opposite the United Nations Headquarters in New York, United States from 14th to 21st September, 2021 to demand for a referendum to decide on the rights to self-determination of the people who want an end to unitary systems of Nigeria which has been turned into an apartheid state.\n\n\u201cWe shall also be demanding, first and foremost, for the abolition of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria which we have shown to be a fraud perpetrated against the people of the South and Middle Belt of Nigeria given that the people did not make it.\n\n\u201cAll the sons and daughters of the Southeast, South-south, Southwest and Middle Belt\u2019s clans, living in the United States of America, are being mobilised to stand up for their indigenous nationalities by participating in the one week \u2018one million march\u2019 for the liberation of their people.\n\n\u201cThe planned march shall be historic and epoch-making. We want the whole world to see the level of injustice, oppression and intimidation currently going on in Nigeria. The time is now.\u201d\n\nThe statement listed Prof Banji Akintoye, Prof Yusuf Turakithe Secretary-General of NINAS, Mr. Tony Nnadi; and National Chairman of Ilana Omo Oodua, Prof Wale Adeniran, among others as leaders of the \u2018one million march.\u2019",

The Commander Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), Major General Ibrahim Ali in a press statement signed by Major Ishaku Gaji Takwa, Military Information Officer, said the violence led to the death of some commuters in the area while several others sustained injuries.\n\nReacting to the fresh violence, Governor Simon Bako Lalong warned those bent on fomenting trouble in the state to desist, stressing that the government would not allow any form of lawlessness disrupt the peace of the state.\n\nWhile commiserating with the families of those affected, the governor assured all law abiding citizens that security had been beefed up around the area as well as the entire metropolis to forestall further breach of the peace.",

          "title": "2023: APC scared of coming of a third force",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nSocial critic, renowned legal expert, and human rights activist, Comrade Femi Aborishade who was in the trenches with the late Chief Gani Fawehinmi (Senior Advocate of the Masses) in the fight for the nation\u2019s democracy is dissatisfied with the abuse of governance in the country.\n\nIn this encounter with Sunday Sun, he told Nigerians that both the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) do not have what it takes to lead the country in 2023.\n\nHe expressed apprehension on other critical national issues, including PIB, e-transmission of election results, restructuring, among others. Excerpt:\n\nLet\u2019s know your take on agitations by different groups in Nigeria, particularly the Sunday Igboho, Nnamdi Kanu saga?\n\nI do not support secession calls or agitations, but I defend the right of those advocating it. Provided they agitate without violence, they should not be repressed or suppressed. In 2014, the Scots had a referendum to remain within the UK or become independent of the UK. Majority voted against being independent of the UK. Article 72 of the former USSR Constitution expressly provided for the right to secede. The African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Right which Nigeria has domesticated as a law passed by the National Assembly under Section 12 of the Constitution, recognises self-determination struggles as a democratic right. But I do not support or advocate secession because I know even if Nigeria is broken up into one thousand republics, the problems being experienced in Nigeria today, particularly insecurity and other economic poverty induced problems would merely be replicated in each of the emerging republics, so long as there is no paradigm shift in the pro-rich philosophy of governance that governs Nigeria at the present time.\n\nMost critics say that the government is romancing bandits, but hard on agitators, do you share in this view?\n\nIt is worrisome that this is the reality in Nigeria today. Government should address the root cause of secessionist agitations, which is poverty, and stop going after individual agitators. Individuals may be arrested, caged, or even killed. However, for as long as hunger, diseases, unemployment, physical insecurity are not resolved, other people would arise to continue the same agitations. An idea becomes a material force, beyond individuals, when objective conditions make the idea to grip the mind of wide layers of the society. An individual may be removed from the public space, temporarily or even eliminated permanently, their ideas may not be eliminated if the context of daily life experiences fertilizes their idea. Secessionist agitation is not the child of Sunday Igboho or Kanu; it is the child of socio-economic cum political exclusion felt by wide layers of the society who seek to escape from a collapsing house created by collapsed governance system.\n\nHow would you react to the controversy surrounding e-transmission of election results?\n\nThe vote against electronic transmission of election results by the national assembly shows that the APC, which has the majority of the legislators, is not interested in free and fair election. The party has realised that having failed ordinary people in all issues of welfare, the downtrodden are hungry and angry and would never vote APC in any free and fair election. This does not mean PDP automatically becomes the electoral choice of the masses. PDP hardly exists as a contender for power as most of the \u201cwho-is-who\u201d in the party have all defected to the APC for fear of being prosecuted for corruption. They know APC is a safe haven for the rotten and corrupt politician. This does not mean everybody in the APC is corrupt. Far from it. We are, however, concerned about the general tendency, which does not rule out exceptions being found. The APC is scared of the People\u2019s Alternative Political Movement led by Jaye Gaskia, Femi Falana, SAN, Prof Omotoye Olorode, and other radicals who are likely going to have an electoral alliance with organised labour-backed Labour Party and the PRP, if the Labour Party is rescued from being a bought and sold commodity for the conventional politicians and the PRP overcomes its internal divisive challenges. Without electronic transmission of election results, Nigeria is doomed under the APC as the pilot of Nigeria. The electorate should reject the APC in any future election just as the APC-dominated National Assembly rejected electronic transmission of election results, in spite of the declaration by the INEC that it has the capacity for electronic transmission of results.\n\nWhat is your view on PIB especially the three per cent to the host community?\n\nThe problem with the PIB is beyond three or five or 10 per cent to the host community. The real problem with the PIB is that it is a neo-liberal piece of legislation that has now legitimised the privatisation of the NNPC, which ordinary people and radical organisations have been resisting for decades in this country. It should be noted that within six months of the operation of the PIB, after it has been assented to by Mr. President, a commercial and profit focused NNPC Limited shall, mandatorily or obligatorily, be incorporated under CAMA. Its ultimate goal is to take over the assets and interests of the NNPC, to facilitate sale of shares or privatisation of the assets. This means the PIB is nothing but a piece of legislation to rob or steal the wealth that belongs to all and hand over to the private sector people, legitimately, or \u201caccording to law\u201d. In that context, ordinary people in the host communities and in Nigeria, as a whole, have been dispossessed or robbed through the PIB. Organised Labour, the People\u2019s Alternative Political Movement (TPAPM) and all other radical forces should resist the PIB.\n\nSome people have argued that Nigeria no longer need restructuring when there is a rotation principle in the system\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) Restructuring is not the ultimate solution to Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic problems, but there is nothing wrong with restructuring. The making and/or remaking of a nation-state is work-in-progress, it is never a final product achieved once and for all times. The existing structure of Nigeria, as a federation of 36 states and 774 local governments, is a product of continued restructuring. Restructuring cannot be juxtaposed with the notion of rotation. Rotational principle applies to individual political parties in terms of their elitist distribution of offices within the party or share of elective positions and/or political appointments. They are completely two different concepts. However, there is the tendency for the operation of the two concepts to serve only elitist goals. For example, that President Mohammadu Buhari is Fulani does not mean his government has policies and programmes that serve the interest of ordinary Fulanis who are poor, uneducated and have to trek thousands of miles herding cattle on a daily basis. Similarly, that former President Obasanjo is Yoruba does not mean his government served the interest of the ordinary Yoruba people who remain poor, frustrated, uneducated, ill, homeless and unemployed till today.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: I allowed Teachers Naija clash with BBNaija for comparison, says convener",
          "text": "The second edition of Teachers Naija, a Nigerian reality TV show, has continued to attract attention since it kicked off on August 3 with 20 housemates battling for its N37 million grand prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reality show, an initiative of Anub Media Limited, had its first season in 2019 where the winner, first and second runner-up went home with N1.5 million, N1 million, and N500,000 respectively.\n\nThere was however an improvement in the second season wherein the winner is expected to get a 2-bedroom flat in Abuja and go home with N2 million, while the first and the second runner up will get N1.5 million and N1 million respectively.\n\nThe second season was originally billed for 2020 but it could not hold as planned due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnuagwuna Ubaka, the show\u2019s convener, had earlier told TheCable Lifestyle that the essence of the reality TV show is to reward teachers as the profession has been looked down on for so long.\n\nWith eight housemates already evicted from the house as of Thursday, 12 teachers are now left to compete for the ultimate prize.\n\nIn this interview, Ubaka tells TheCable Lifestyle about his expectations for the show, its reception, challenges faced so far, and plans for the next season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow has the show been received by Nigerians so far since the first season?\n\nWe didn\u2019t know the impact we had in 2019 and the reach we were able to get. In 2020, we received calls from various persons asking when the show\u2019s next edition is going to start but we couldn\u2019t do that because of COVID-19.\n\nThis year, the reception has been fantastic. A lot of people have been calling to commend us that this is the kind of show they want their children to watch. It\u2019s a family show, any age can watch it and the viewers are telling us that they are also learning in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was the selection process of the teachers like?\n\nThere was a promotion for all teachers around Nigeria to apply. We did this with Teachers registration council of Nigeria (TRCN). We said they must be between 21-40 years old, they must be Nigerian, must have either B.Sc ed, NCE, or a postgraduate diploma in education.\n\nAfter that, we streamlined the people that applied based on their qualifications. Then we told those that were selected for the second stage to send in a video of them teaching which showed us their communication level and how engaging they are. We then streamlined it to 20 that eventually came into the house.\n\nWhat challenge (s) did you face in putting the show together?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the biggest challenge is sponsorship. It\u2019s a full show televised on national television so bringing people from different parts of the country and hosting them for 20 days is also money sapping. It\u2019s been so challenging trying to pull resources together to achieve this.\n\nHow much has been spent so far to put the show together?\n\nThe show is money sapping. Organising this kind of show and putting it on TV requires a lot of money. We\u2019re talking about from N30 million upwards. To continue to sustain that, we need sponsorship. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on well-meaning Nigerians. We are calling on local organisations, government bodies, and international organisations to key into this because we have a lot we want to do. If we\u2019re able to get these sponsorships, it will help us achieve more.\n\nThe show is running at the same time as BBNaija, do you have any worries about this? What sets the teachers\u2019 reality show apart from other reality shows?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we advertised the date for our show, some people suggested that we should change it because it\u2019s going to clash with BBNaija but I told them I actually want it to clash because what we\u2019re doing is totally different. Our show is educative, our show has morals, our show is promoting education and it\u2019s child friendly.\n\nI told them that I want this show to be on air at the same time because I want these people to see an ideal show. So, when they compare they\u2019ll see how a show should look like. And that can only be done when the two shows are running at the same time. So, I\u2019m not worried that it\u2019s airing at the same time as another big show.\n\nWhat strategies do you plan to use to attract more attention for next season?\n\nFor the third season, we\u2019re going to bring out more resources for promotion. Not a lot of people know what we\u2019re doing right now so that\u2019s one area that I want to improve in the third season. We also want to showcase the rich cultural heritage of Nigeria in the third season.\n\nApart from the gifts the winner and runners-up will be getting, what do you expect the teachers to take away from this show?\n\nThe show should have taught them discipline, how to relate more with their students, how to build team spirit because we had a lot of team exercises. The aim of these exercises is to let them work as a team when they get back to their schools.\n\nWhen they get back home, they\u2019ll know how to put in all efforts to make sure they sustain their schools. We\u2019re also in partnership with the chartered institute of educational practitioners and they\u2019ve promised a postgraduate diploma scholarship for them.\n\nBelow are some photos from the reality show:\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "For a founder, the startup world is an exciting yet very challenging one.\n\nWhile there have been many startup success stories over the past two decades, globally, the majority fail to make it past early-stage due to a number of reasons; inadequate funding, business model/strategy failure, or product/market challenges.\n\nThe odds are even greater for startups based in emerging regions like Africa, where there is a dearth of funding, an economy-crippling infrastructure gap, a massive consumer base with low purchasing power, political hostility and uncertainty as well as fragmented markets.\n\nA lack of access to capital is often cited as the biggest reason businesses fail in Africa and other emerging markets. But apart from funding, it can be helpful for founders in such markets to also get mentoring \u2013 preferably from people who have first-hand experience \u2013 as they embark on their startup journey with unknowns and untread paths.\n\nWith this in mind, a global collective of startup founders with expertise in several industries and geographies has been providing both access to capital and mentorship to early-stage startups and founders for more than three years.\n\nA fund by founders for founders\n\nMAGIC Fund, launched in 2017, is an early-stage venture capital fund built by founders turned investors. It has 12 founders from across the world who act as general partners with the Co-founder and CEO of Helium Health, Adegoke Olubusi, serving as managing partner, and Matt Greenleaf as operating partner.\n\nThe fund is built on two theses. One, that pooling funds and resources of individual founder-investors together open the group to more opportunities for investments, which they could then evaluate better using their diverse skill sets.\n\nMost founders-turned-investors go the angel investing or venture capital way alone, a practice that often comes with geographical and expertise limitations.\n\nRealising this, Greenleaf and MAGIC\u2019s other partners \u2013 who met Olubusi when Helium Health was going through the Y Combinator accelerator programme in 2017 \u2013 co-invest together.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is like a fund of micro funds built by founders,\u201d Greenleaf told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cBefore we started, we were all into some kind of investing as founders but realised that with our expertise in particular industries, it would make more sense to consolidate our collective intelligence and streamline our angel investment practice through a fund,\u201d he explained.\n\nMAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million, comprising the founders\u2019 personal monies according to Greenleaf.\n\nWith its first fund, MAGIC invested in over 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelping founders on their journey\n\nTwo, MAGIC believes that smaller funds run by founders perform best in early-stage investing. Thus, the fund backs startups solving challenges across the world at their earliest stages.\n\nMAGIC has provided founders with more than just money, Greenleaf notes.\n\nUnlike traditional investors whose main focus is getting sweet returns on investments, the founders-investors at MAGIC with startup experience also look out for how much value they can drive for startups invested in.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s investment comes with support for founders through knowledge sharing and sessions with experts in relevant fields. This way, they help early-stage founders find product-market fit, fine-tune business models, and fundraising strategies for successful seed rounds.\n\nAccording to Greenleaf, the Fund\u2019s partners offer mentoring, advice, and network connectivity to support investee-founders as they scale their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe bring that general knowledge and know-how to help other founders run a company from zero to 100,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people in the team who have started multiple companies and have access to people who have helped build unicorns. With that collective knowledge of the team, we provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nMAGIC Fund\u2019s expanded team.\n\nSome of the startups MAGIC has invested in and supported so far include Bankly, Mono, Eden Life, Evolve Credit, Indicina, Bamboo, Chronus Health, Oxygen, Kiwibot, etc.\n\nBy investing in startups and mentoring early-stage founders, Olubusi believes the way MAGIC Fund operates provides the general partners an opportunity to give back to their ecosystems.\n\n\u201cLater-stage founders whose companies have gone beyond the initial pre-seed, seed, or product-market fit stage have a very critical role to play in facilitating and helping grow their ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we get to do at the fund.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAfter seeing success from its investments \u2013 MAGIC Fund 1 performed 5x over the period of three years, according to Olubusi \u2013 the company has raised a second fund of $30 million announced recently.\n\n\u201cWe had fully deployed the first fund so we thought: why not scale up the strategy since it worked so well and bring a few more people on board?\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a full-time dedicated team for fund 1 but now have that and 15 general partners who help with different industries. Obviously, $30 million is a lot of money to deploy and manage.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSome of the new partners joining the MAGIC team are the founders of startups invested in under Fund 1 but have exited. According to MAGIC, one-third of the new fund was contributed by the founder-general partners.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s limited partner base is diverse, with 50% of them black and 33% women. Some of the LPs are Paystack\u2019s Shola Akinlade, Olugbenga Agboola, the CEO of Nigeria\u2019s Flutterwave, and Hendra Kwik of Payfazz in Southeast Asia, Katie Lewis, Michael Seibel, Kirsten Connell of Octopus Ventures, Tim Draper, etc.\n\nJoining as partners are Evercare\u2019s Temi Awogboro, Troy Osinoff, Tom Chen of Stitchroom, Elvis Zhang of Oxy2, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, and Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky.\n\nMagic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages, Greenleaf revealed. The global fund is sector agnostic and plans to focus on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women\u2019s health, developer tools, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

You can find out what to expect here and check out 3 reasons not to miss SME Clinic 2021.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ll let you read the testimonials of three participants from SME Clinic 2020.\n\n\u201cRunning a business in Nigeria is really not easy, and for me as an entrepreneur, attending SME Clinic by Techpoint Africa in 2020 played a pivotal role at the early stage of my business. At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F. Adeleke, CEO, Qiqi Farms.\n\nThis year\u2019s Clinic promises to be value-packed. There will be learning, unlearning, networking, and growth.\n\nJoin us at SME Clinic 2021 to learn more about how to market and grow your business online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Bird Offer!

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "2023: Who will rebuild Nigeria?",
          "text": "The popular question on the lips of many citizens nowadays is, \u201cwho will rebuild Nigeria?\u201d\n\nThe question became necessary when viewed from the current situation of the country and its abysmal rating in all departments of life.\n\nObservers converge on the belief that Nigeria has been wrecked, needing urgent total re-engineering. Nigeria today has become a laughing stock in the comity of nations, even on the African continent where it claims to be the giant.\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, while addressing journalists Wednesday on the need for total overhaul of Nigeria, said the country has been totally destroyed and has descended into a level never experienced in her history.\n\nNigeria seems to be in a more precarious situation now than in 2015 when a coalition of opposition parties, some prominent Nigerians and even some caucus in the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), the ruling party then, joined forces with others to push out of power the then president Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nFor many then, it was \u2018anybody but Jonathan\u2019. Today, they all are regretting as the acclaimed \u2018messiah\u2019 seems to be sleeping while the country keeps drifting apart from insecurity, growing poverty, economic meltdown, more corruption, nepotism, favouritism, among other ills.\n\nA senior lecturer with a federal university, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that even some of those who shouted \u201chosanna\u201d then, are singing a different tune.\n\n\u201cThings are getting out of hand in the country. We can see it; we can smell it. Even an unborn baby can sense that all is not well with Nigeria. Many of those who kicked out Jonathan have even openly confessed and begged him to forgive them. We all heard what Tunde Bakare said the other day about a government he helped to install. It has never been bad. So, Nigerians must \u2018shine their eyes\u2019 in 2023. Once bitten twice shy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe terrible situation of the country was probably the reason Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB), a former military head of state, made recommendations for the choice of presidential candidates come 2023.\n\nBabangida had at a recent interview with Arise Television in his home in Minna, prescribed the quality of candidates Nigerians should be looking at.\n\nIBB\u2019s recommendation has been trending in the traditional and social media platforms across the country.\n\nAs expected, many Nigerians are already talking and some are tackling him from different corners.\n\nMost people, who used to be supporters of IBB are angry that their once famed hero, is talking when he should cover his face in shame for destroying democracy in Nigeria with the annulment of June 12 election, where Moshood Abiola, won convincingly.\n\n\u201cI think IBB has murdered democracy and should not come close to it again, even making suggestions,\u201d Thomas Enenche, an Abuja-based lawyer and human right activist, said.\n\nRead Also: IBB: Corruption worse under civilian leaders than military rulers\n\nEnenche, who was once a fan of IBB, decried that the so-called \u2018IBB Boys\u2019 are still in power and carrying on with the squandering culture of their mentor.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, IBB is still a political godfather, even though he should be in jail for annulling June 12 election and for not accounting for the crude oil windfall during his regime, those he mentored are part of the people running the country down. You cannot give what you don\u2019t have, IBB disrupted nascent democracy in the country and should not be listened to,\u201d Enenche said.\n\nPutting things in the right perspective, some keen observers of Nigerian politics, who have also blamed the poor governance and retarded development in the country since return to democracy in 1999 on the bad influence of military in the Nigerian affairs, think that the military has not left politics as retired Army generals are taking turn to become civilian president of the country, hence, any recommendation from one of them should be jettisoned.\n\nObafemi Oluwole, a university don and founder, African Diversity Group, a pan-African development policy, strategy and governance platform, thinks that IBB should be resting in his retirement and should made recommendations to his \u2018boys\u2019 who are desperate for power like him, to give priority to the interest and prosperity of the country than the amassing of Nigeria\u2019s wealth and rubbing it on the faces of the poor masses.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria is a developed country, the likes of IBB would have served many years in jail for their actions against democratic and economic development of the country. The annulment of June 12 set the country back and we are feeling the impact till date. If IBB had respected the wishes of Nigerians then, our democracy would have grown better and there would be no need to recycle retired army generals to rule us for lack of credible candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nThe associate professor of Political Science warned the political class to allow the masses to decide who would rule them, no matter the party, tribe, religion or geopolitical zone.\n\nHis suggestions above, according to him, should have been what IBB should recommend, but that IBB cannot make such suggestions because he has no moral standing to talk in the Nigerian democracy which he dealt the heaviest blow on.\n\nEbelem Kalunta, a former lawmaker in the Abia State House of Assembly, decried that IBB enshrined what he called \u2018chop I chop system, where sharing of the national wealth is the common interest of office holders; whether political, public or private.\n\n\u201cThis has been the bane of corruption in the country, which President Buhari is fighting lopsidedly today. Imagine a corrupt politician moving from PDP to APC and the court will acquit him of corruption charges. There is no difference in the military generals\u2019 approach to leadership.\n\n\u201cSo, not just IBB, Obasanjo, and Buhari, every other serving or retired military general should not think of politics, they should make suggestions on how to address insecurity in the country, which is their primary assignment and not politics this time. Let them stay in the barracks even in their retirement, we don\u2019t need them,\u201d Kalunta said.\n\nKalunta also thinks that the choice of the next Nigerian president will be better decided by the masses, and that the process should have started from the time the present administration gave up on terrorists and bandits, but that the opposition has continually lacked the strength to push the ruling party to make good decisions.\n\n\u201cIf PDP and other opposition parties are doing half of what APC did before 2015, the government would not have forced so many bad policies and inhuman actions on Nigerians. Instead of IBB, let the masses make recommendations and insist on them, let the opposition field better candidates and tackle the government as they should and we will have a good leader come 2023,\u201d the former lawmaker concluded.\n\nWith less than two years to the 2023 presidential election, political activities appear to be picking up with realignment and re-realignment of forces.\n\nIn the last few months, some leading politicians have declared their interest in the presidential race in Nigeria.\n\nPerhaps, the first was former, Zamfara State governor, Sanni Yerima, Kingsley Moghalu, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Sam Ohuabunwa, president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN).\n\nSeveral other prominent politicians including Peter Obi and Rochas Okorocha, former governors of Anambra and Imo states, respectively, and Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State are also touted to be interested in contesting for the presidency in 2023.\n\nSome other individuals have also been suggested as good materials for the job. They include, Olisa Agbakoba, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN); Kayode Fayemi, current governor of Ekiti State; Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of Lagos State and current of Works, among others\n\nIn the last few months, there has also been some scheming among regional leaders to have the presidency zoned to their region. It is also important to note that some Nigerians simply do not care which region the president comes from in 2023, their main concern is a leader who is detribalised and represents the general interest of Nigerians.\n\nBuhari was re-elected in 2019, but there is the feeling among many Nigerians that the President has largely failed in the last six years in power.\n\nHis inability to fulfil his campaign promises; part of which was to fight graft, revamp the economy and tackle insecurity have led to general feeling of disenchantment among Nigerians.\n\nObservers say that the President\u2019s penchant for appointing mostly Northerners into public positions which has become controversial in recent times has further dented his administration\u2019s popularity.\n\nAnd amid the spate of insecurity, bad state of the economy and worsening standard of living among Nigerians, which has resulted in the country overtaking India as the country with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty.\n\nMeanwhile, in view of the state of affairs, there is growing concern among stakeholders that there should be increased scrutiny of the qualities Nigerians should look-out for in their future president and where his immediate focus should be when elected into office.\n\nPerhaps, Babangida\u2019s recommendations opened the floor for debate last week when he prescribed that the next Nigeria\u2019s President should be in his 60\u2019s.\n\nHe said such individuals should also have sound knowledge of the economy with contacts across the nation and who had been traversing the geo-political zones marketing their acceptability and capacity.\n\n\u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very versed in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in their 60\u2019s,\u201d Babangida had said.\n\nIn the last one week there have been mixed reactions across Nigeria on the former military ruler\u2019s comments and what should form the yardstick for anyone to emerge Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nWhile some agree with Babangida\u2019s view others simply disagreed, while others criticised his sense of judgment.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with BusinessDay, Ayo Adebanjo, leader of pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, disagreed with Babangida, saying that Nigeria\u2019s next president should be decided based on competence rather than age.\n\nAdebanjo suggested that age could not be used to determine who can effectively rule the country, citing examples from western countries.\n\nThe Afenifere leader stressed that the younger population had not even proven that they had learned from the older ones in terms of governance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with this; that is not the situation in developing countries. Age should not be the basis for determining who rules Nigeria, I don\u2019t believe in age. Any competent individual can rule; even the young ones appear not to have learned their lesson.\n\n\u201cBabangida should stop feeding us with that nonsense, he should shut up; if we have a proper system such people should be under trial by now\u201d.\n\nPolitical Analyst, Kunle Okunade said the intending president should have a clear understanding of the economy, respect the rule of law and be a nationalist who can unite the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHe must have a clear understanding of how to revive Nigeria\u2019s economy. He must have a record of respecting the rule of law. He must have nationalistic tendencies in his thinking and communication.\n\n\u201cHe must not be up to 70years old and be able to connect and communicate with the youths. He must be an exposed individual who has friends and associates across the globe. He must understand how to manage the diversity of the country and reposition the country for greatness\u201d.\n\nFormer youth leader of the defunct Kowa Party, Mavis Abhulimen, urged Nigerians to be careful in deciding who governs the country from 2023, adding that such individual\u2019s leadership experience and antecedent was crucial.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigerians have to choose wisely. The kind of president I would want in 2023 is a person with a dynamic personality. A candidate not tainted by our past history; one who has credibility in his antecedents.\n\n\u201cA candidate that is in touch with the realities of today\u2019s Nigeria. A man or woman who has been successful in managing businesses or enterprises or institutions with excellence that no one can argue about. I believe that a president that will make the difference should be within the age bracket of 50 and 65\u201d.\n\nNigeria is in dire need of a deliverer. Recently, Professor Attahiru Jega, a former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), openly castigated the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), urging Nigerians to reject the two political parties in 2023.\n\nBut the challenge is getting the Third Force in a country where politicians are not ready to give established parties a fight.\n\nFor instance, before 2019 general election, many real and quasi-politicians bandied the Third Force concept, but they all chickened out.\n\nThey complained that the two major parties were too big to wrestle down. All of a sudden, the proponents of the 3rd force emptied themselves into the ruling party.",
          "summary": "Nigeria today has become a laughing stock in the comity of nations, even on the African continent where it claims to be the giant.\nEven an unborn baby can sense that all is not well with Nigeria.\nIn the last few months, some leading politicians have declared their interest in the presidential race in Nigeria.\nPerhaps, the first was former, Zamfara State governor, Sanni Yerima, Kingsley Moghalu, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Sam Ohuabunwa, president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN).\nIn the last one week there have been mixed reactions across Nigeria on the former military ruler\u2019s comments and what should form the yardstick for anyone to emerge Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.",

          "text": "Lagos is a busy, exciting, and yet very stressful city. Personally speaking, working in Apapa, and living on what Lagosians call the \u2018island\u2019 can sometimes mean up to 3 hours in traffic on any given day. I always joke and say that the traffic alone in Lagos, can break up relationships and I would be curious to test that hypothesis.\n\nThe bustle and hustle of the most populous city in Africa can be exhilarating in some ways, yet ever so chaotic at the same time. I always say that if you can live in Lagos, you can pretty much live anywhere. Hate it or love it Lagos is Lagos, and it is important to create a balanced wellness routine to offset the day-to-day stresses.\n\nRead also: Is Slow the most exclusive restaurant in Lagos?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic somewhat made everyone take a much-needed pause and many people found themselves idle at home in their thoughts. The lockdown forced many to start practising wellness and exercise routines at home, focusing on a concept called \u201cself-care\u201d. Self-care is not synonymous with self-indulgence or being selfish. Self-care means taking care of your mental and physical health, so you have the ability to do all the things you wish to accomplish on a daily basis: excel at your job or business and help care for others.\n\nWellness in Lagos\n\nWellness according to the Global Wellness Institute is \u2018the active pursuit of activities, choices, and lifestyles that lead to a state of holistic health\u2019. Wellness has always been an important part of my work-life balance, so I was excited to discover wellness at the Dew Centre which is located on 31 Adebayo Doherty Streetin the upscale neighbourhood of Lekki Lagos.\n\nThe Dew Wellness Centre\n\nThe Dew Centre is the brainchild of notable interior designer and wellness advocate, Omon Anenih-Mordi and Africa\u2019s first design consultancy, boutique hotel and wellness centre. It promises its clientele a safe space for self-discovery and healing from the hustle and bustle of Lagos city.\n\nOur visit to the DEW Center was exhilarating and relaxing. Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed with a smile. We were taken on a mini-tour of the sensory garden, spa and amazing health and wellness facilities. As we stepped foot in the DEW centre, we were fascinated by the amazing art pieces and the beautiful, artistic and creative images that paid homage to the African woman in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe DEW centre\u2019s ambience is serene and peaceful. We opted for the Viny\u0101sa yoga class and I can say that it strengthened my core, relieved my stress and gave me some high-intensity workout training. We had a wonderful instructor Tunde (@lifelongfitnessintl on Instagram). He was just perfect: courteous and patient and designed the session to cater to our specific fitness capacity. Boffy also enjoyed it thoroughly and are now committed to practising yoga daily.\n\nBenefits of yoga\n\nYoga is a great way to work on your flexibility and strength. Just about everyone can do it. It\u2019s not just for people who can touch their toes or want to meditate. Some types of yoga are about relaxation, whilst others are similar to the one we practised at the Dew centre, make you move more. Most types focus on learning poses, called asanas.\n\nThey also usually include attention to breathing. Yoga poses work by stretching your muscles. They can help you move better and feel less stiff or tired. In one study, people improved their flexibility by up to 35% after only 8 weeks of yoga.\n\nThere is a misconception that yoga is an alternative to religious practice; it is not and has nothing to do with worship. You can actually burn up to 1000 calories in a one-hour session. I have practised yoga before, but I was seriously challenged.\n\nSome styles of yoga, such as ashtanga and power yoga, are very physical. Many of the poses, such as downward dog, upward dog, and the plank pose, build upper-body strength. The standing poses, especially if you hold them for several long breaths, build strength in your hamstrings, quadriceps, and abs. Poses that strengthen the lower back include the upward dog and the chair pose. When done right, nearly all poses build core strength in the deep abdominal muscles.\n\nAfter our workout session, we went on to have a full body massage, and it was wonderful and soothing. The massage room was beautiful, the background music had a tranquil and calming effect, and the masseuse was polite and professional.\n\nThe Dew massage rooms are very relaxing, you will not miss the breathtaking photographs by renowned Nigerian photographer Kelechi Amadi- Obi. The series of photographs which I will dare to call pieces of art is entitled \u201cThe Bare Exhibition\u201d which features a series of carefully curated photographs with nude subjects that explore the theme of freedom, self-exploration, self-acceptance, and identity through a study of the female form. \u201cThe bare exhibition is focused on the female form, but it is more than just the body. It is about self-acceptance, body confidence, owning your truth, and stepping out of the shadows, and into the light\u201d says Omon Anenih-Mordi.\n\nBenefits of massage therapy\n\nWhen it comes to relaxation, there are a few things we all associate with that it, and a massage definitely one of them. It is great for relaxation and has therapeutic benefits, too. The term \u201cmassage\u201d itself actually encompasses a wide array of different types of massage, ranging from Swedish massage (the most common type) to massages that have a more targeted and specific purpose, like a sports massage, which is aimed at helping athletes recover.\n\nNo matter the type of massage, the benefits come down to one thing: pressure. \u201cThe skin is moved during a moderate pressure massage, which results in a calming and slowing of the nervous system,\u201d says Tiffany Field, PhD, director at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Massage therapy also has these benefits: decrease in heart rate lowered blood pressure, and changes in EEG patterns (electrical activity in your brain).\n\nWhat I find unique about the Dew Centre is that it\u2019s not just a spa or yoga studio in Lagos, they use design to take the concept of total wellness while recognizing that a person\u2019s every thought, word, experience and behaviour affects their greater health and wellbeing. The wellness centre\u2019s design of spaces, as well as all the services, ensure the promotion of education, clarity, connection, common sense, empathy, and well-being. The Dew centre is the first of its kind in Africa, mixing elements of design, education and wellness.\n\nThe Food and the Sensory garden\n\nTo round up our experience we had a light lunch at Angelo\u2019s caf\u00e9 in the Sensory Garden, which is a literal garden area where you can relax while enjoying some tea and light lunch. It was beautiful scenery and offered tranquillity as we munched on our salmon and turkey sandwiches while enjoying the soft breeze and the freshness from the exotic collections of plants. The Dew Centre offers the possibility to become a plant mom or dad. They offer plant care services as well. It was the perfect way to round up our day and we felt re-energized.\n\nWe left the DEW centre feeling excited, rejuvenated and relaxed. We will definitely be back for more yoga classes, massages, and also to check out their counselling services, because mental health is as important as physical health. What I love most is that wellness is an inside-out experience at The Dew Centre, and I encourage you to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Lagos and spend some time at the Dew.\n\nTo find out more visit www.thedewcentre.com",

So, I want you to sit down and go through how monies that come into the university are spent.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI have listened to your presentations and I am convinced.

          "text": "Few hours after announcing a dusk-to-dawn curfew in three local government areas of Jos North, Jos South and Bassa, Plateau State governor, Simon Bako Lalong has directed the imposition of a 24-hour curfew in Jos North to contain further security threats.\n\nThis comes after travellers were yesterday ambushed and about 23 killed by suspected Irigwe youth in apparent retaliatory attack.\n\nThe victims were said to be Sufi Muslims who attended a religious gathering for Muslim new year in Bauchi and were on their way back to the South where they reside.\n\nMany were said to have been based in Ondo State, Southwest Nigeria. The state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, had yesterday, condemned the attack in a statement.\n\nThe killing follows months of repeated clashes between rigwe youth and Fulani herders who had reportedly sustained attacks in the area for periods.\n\nIn the past two days, the Irigwe youth had repeatedly announced that they were conveying the corpses of their kin slain by suspected herders for burial in Bassa on Saturday.\n\nReports said they had set out in a convoy for the burial on Saturday morning when violence broke out along the way at Rukuba road.\n\nAs they went with the corpses, they met some vans conveying some Muslims identified as Fulani along their way. The Fulani reportedly claimed they were commuters from Bauchi, but the angry youth challenged them seeing that Rukuba road does not connect Bauchi highway. They suspected that they may have come to attack them at the burial ground.\n\nThe irate youth were said to have dragged their victims out of their vehicles which were trapped in gridlock around Rukuba Road in Jos and started killing them using machetes, daggers, knives, stones and other dangerous weapons.\n\nThough the violence has been quelled by Soldiers drafted from the Special Task Force (STF) on security, and at least 20 people have been arrested, the city is still enveloped in palpable tension.\n\nGovernor Lalong\u2019s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Macham Makut announced the curfew in a statement in Jos on Sunday\n\nThe statement quoted the Governor as saying \u201cfrom 2pm of today, Sunday 15th August 2021, a 24-hour curfew will come into effect in Jos North Local Government Area. This is necessitated by security reports which indicate rising threats to the safety of lives and properties within the Local Government\u201d.\n\nThe Governor urged citizens to abide by the curfew and remain indoors to allow security agencies maintain law and order and deal with those bent on causing chaos.\n\nThe Governor said that the 24 hour curfew in Jos North Local Government will remain in force until further notice adding\n\n\u201cAgain, citizens are to note that the 24 hour curfew in Jos North will take effect from 2pm today 15th August 202.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, police in a statement on Sunday, said 20 people have been arrested in connection with the incident, while another 33 people have been rescued.\n\nThis is as the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba, on Sunday ordered the immediate deployment of Police Intervention Team to Plateau State to carry out an on-the-spot assessment.\n\nThe team, which comprises personnel of Police Tactical Units \u2013 the Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), Police Special Forces, amongst others, is being led by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of Finance and Administration, Sanusi Lemu.\n\nAlso deployed are investigators and covert operatives from the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) and the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB), who are expected to provide additional investigative, intelligence and forensic support to the Plateau State Police Command in the ongoing investigations and rescue operations.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Force spokesman, Frank MBA, the squads are to ensure enhanced, coordinated response to protect the community and boost public confidence in the affected area(s) of the State in order to prevent further attacks as well as bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nThe police chief enjoined citizens in the affected area(s) to support the security forces deployed to the hotspot by providing useful information that will lead to the arrest of other perpetrators of the crime and forestall any further attack.\n\nThe statement added, \u201dThe IGP, while condemning the incident, has called for calm and assured victims and relatives of the attack that the Police are working with the military, other security forces and the State Government to ensure that all perpetrators of the unfortunate incident are brought to book\n\nEarlier In a statement on Saturday, the Plateau State Police Command blamed Irigwe youth for killing, noting that suspects have been arrested for\n\n\u201cOn 14/08/2021 at about 0928hrs, the Plateau State Police Command received a distress call that a group of attackers suspected to be Irigwe youths and their sympathisers along Rukuba Road of Jos North LGA attacked a convoy of five buses with Muslim faithful who were coming back from the Annual Zikr prayer in Bauchi State and are heading to Ikare in Ondo State,\u201d the police had said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, twenty-two (22) persons were killed and Fourteen injured in the attack.\n\n\u201cUpon receipt of the report, a team of Police personnel, the military and other sister agencies were immediately mobilised to the scene where twenty one (21) victims were rescued and six suspects arrested.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Plateau State Command, CP Edward Egbuka along with the GOC 3-Division, Major General Ibrahim Ali, also visited the scene and ordered for a discreet investigation to fish out other perpetrators of this barbaric act at large.\n\n\u201cThe Cp warned that those that perpetrated this dastardly act & others that incited it, will be made to face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Command urges the public to remain calm and to furnish the Police with useful information that will aid the investigation.\u201d\n\nLalong had on Saturday condemned the killings and directed security agencies to swiftly identify and arrest the perpetrators while dominating the area to restore calm.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Director of Press, Macham read in part: \u201cGovernor Simon Bako Lalong has warned trouble makers bent on fomenting trouble in Plateau State to desist as the government will not allow any form of lawlessness to disrupt the peace of the State.\n\n\u201cLalong said the attacks on innocent citizens no matter their backgrounds will never be tolerated in Plateau State and those who are found to be behind such attacks will be dealt with decisively to serve as deterrence and restore public order.\n\n\u201cThe Governor however commends security agencies for their immediate response leading to the arrest of some suspects and the restoration of calm to the area.\u201d\n\nThe Governor also commiserated with the families of those affected, and assured all law abiding citizens that security had been beefed up around the area as well as the entire metropolis to forestall further breach of the peace.\n\nHe reminded the citizens to remain vigilant and be security conscious in reporting suspicious persons and behaviour within their domains to enable law enforcement agencies to respond appropriately.\n\nLalong also directed the Secretary to the Government of the State, Prof. Danladi Atu to visit the areas and ascertain the situation as well as ensure that those injured received adequate medical attention.\n\nThe peace of the state has been troubled by series of skirmishes in recent times, leading to several deaths and destruction of properties, especially in Bassa and Riyom Local Government Areas. The Governor has repeatedly warned that violent merchants won\u2019t be allowed to have their way in the state.",

          "title": "At least 304 dead as 7.2-magnitude earthquake hits Haiti",
          "text": "Not less than 304 people are reported dead following a massive 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti on Saturday morning.\n\nThe earthquake also shook buildings from the neighboring Dominican Republic to Jamaica and Cuba, as the international community is confronted the prospect of a major escalation in the humanitarian crisis already facing one of the hemisphere\u2019s most deeply troubled nations.\n\nSaturday\u2019s earthquake was stronger, though centered farther from the capital, than the devastating 2010 temblor that killed more than 220,000, prompting foreign governments and aid agencies to prepare for large numbers of dead, injured and homeless. Officials and witnesses reported heavy damage and fatalities dozens of miles from the epicenter, 7.2 miles northeast of Saint-Louis du Sud, where the quake struck at 8:29 a.m. Haiti\u2019s civil protection office reported at least 304 people had died \u2014 most of them in the hardest-hit southern and western areas \u2014 with hundreds more missing and 1,800 injured. The death toll is expected to rise amid reports that some neighborhoods had been razed, Washington Post reported.\n\nGovernment officials, relief agencies and representatives from the United Nations were still assessing the damage, including via reconnaissance flights over the southern and western parts of the country, as a wave of aftershocks continued to hit Haiti. But the sheer force of the temblor and a climbing death toll suggest a devastating new tragedy in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s poorest nation, which has lurched from crisis to crisis for years.\n\nThe disaster struck about a month after the assassination of the president, leaving a hobbled interim government in charge of a country so wracked by gang violence and a collapsing rule of law that observers have dubbed it the Somalia of the Caribbean.\n\nNow, 11 years after the devastating 2010 earthquake, Haitians are again dealing with crushed bodies, collapsed buildings and overwhelmed hospitals.\n\nAccording to Wash Post, authorities mobilized teams to clear roads and bridges that are either damaged by the earthquake or blocked by landslides and deploy medical supplies and food to disaster sites. Hundreds of homes, as well as schools, churches and at least one hospital, they said, have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nPrime Minister Ariel Henry, who is leading the interim government, declared a state of emergency in the hardest-hit portions of the country. He did not issue a call for immediate international assistance. Referring to foreign earthquake aid after 2010 that Haitians said was ill-spent, he called for all assistance to be channeled through the state.\n\n\u201cEveryone who wants to help should get in touch with the operation center for national emergency to determine what we need,\u201d he told reporters in Port au Prince.\n\nAt least three urban areas in the southern region \u2014 Jeremie, Les Cayes and Barad\u00e8res \u2014 suffered major damage, with fears of even broader damage in villages and towns closer to the epicenter. Although high call traffic had jammed lines earlier in the day, cellular phone infrastructure in the area remained operational.\n\nRalph Simon, a radio station owner in Jeremie, a city of 30,000 in southwest Haiti, said many homes and buildings had been leveled or damaged, including a church. He said he saw two corpses in the rubble. \u201cThe impact of this is huge,\u201d he said. \u201cI was still in bed with my children and my wife. My wife had a heart attack, and I had to save her life . . . There\u2019s damage to houses. People are crying.\u201d\n\nImages on social media and witnesses portrayed scenes of devastation from collapsed structures, with officials saying residents were pouring into ill-equipped hospitals, bringing the injured in cars and beds of pickup trucks. Neighbors aided rescue workers, trying to lift rubble and knock down walls to reach people.\n\nHaiti\u2019s long, terrible history of earthquakes and disaster\n\nPreliminary disaster modeling from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) predicted hundreds of millions of dollars in damage and thousands of fatalities.\n\nSilvera Guillaume, civil protection coordinator in the coastal city of Les Cayes, said the community\u2019s resources are being overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dire situation, people died. There are people right now under the rubble,\u201d Guillaume said. \u201cWe deployed first responders to go and remove rubble, but we do not have enough first responders.\u201d\n\nAm\u00e9thyste Arc\u00e9lius, administrator of Immaculate Conception Hospital \u2014 the largest in Les Cayes \u2014 said its facilities cannot cope with the injured and that it is in \u201cdesperate\u201d need of personnel and medicines.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of victims,\u201d Arc\u00e9lius said. \u201cThe hospital needs emergency drugs, health professionals of all categories. Lots of people are coming. The hospital is flooded with victims. We are issuing a call for help.\u201d\n\nAt 8:29 a.m., Jabin Phontus, a 23-year-old agronomy student, said he felt his family home in Les Cayes begin to quake.\n\n\u201cI could see the walls breaking, it was scary,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cI took my sister and ran.\u201d\n\nHis mother and brother also escaped their five-room home as it crumbled, leaving them scraped by falling debris.\n\n\u201cThe house is partially destroyed, some walls are still up, but we can\u2019t sleep inside,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where to go now. We are seeking shelter. A lot of houses in the neighborhood are destroyed.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, he said a group of people near him were \u201ctrying to break down a wall to get to someone inside\u201d a house.\n\nIn Barad\u00e8res, closer to the epicenter, former mayor Pascal Calixte said some neighborhoods were \u201c90 percent\u201d destroyed.\n\n\u201cEverybody is panicked,\u201d Calixte said. \u201cThere is a lot of damage. The church is destroyed. Today is market day. But we had landslides and rocks killed some people who were coming to sell their things. In some areas, 90 percent of the houses were destroyed.\u201d\n\nAmong those killed was Jean Gabriel Fortun\u00e9, an influential politician and former mayor of Les Cayes. He and least one other person died when the hotel he owned and lived in, Le Manguier, caved in, according to Duples Plymouth, a communications aide for Fortun\u00e9.\n\nForeign governments have begun to respond to the crisis. The White House said that President Biden authorized an immediate response, naming U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power as the senior U.S. official to coordinate the effort.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has authorised an \u201cimmediate US response\u201d to help Haiti and said USAID would work to support efforts to \u201cassess the damage and assist efforts to recover those who were injured and those who must now rebuild\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn what is already a challenging time for the people of Haiti, I am saddened by the devastating earthquake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe leaders of Colombia, Chile and Mexico also announced plans to quickly send humanitarian assistance.\n\nHaiti became a center for charities and nongovernmental organizations in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Many have left, particularly in recent years as the country has descended into violence. Those remaining are scrambling to respond.\n\nChristy Delafield, spokeswoman for the charity Mercy Corps, said the group is moving to mobilize a team to the area, but relief workers face logistical challenges. The main road to the area runs through gang-filled territories just south of Port-au-Prince, leaving aid groups to focus on access by air.\n\nBut the regional airport in Les Cayes is a rural airstrip with limited capacity and is already overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe saw a similar situation with Hurricane Dorian\u201d that struck the Bahamas in 2019, Delafield said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of capacity in that area to handle assistance.\u201d\n\nMuhamed Bizimana, assistant country director for Care Haiti, said his organization was also facing logistical challenges and relying on \u201clocal staff\u201d for assessments in the hardest-hit areas, given the risks of traveling over land through gang-controlled regions south of Port-au-Prince.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re exploring maritime transport,\u201d he said.\n\nShelters for untold numbers of those experiencing homelessness \u2014 especially in denser urban areas in the south and west \u2014 remain an immediate priority, he said.\n\nLonger term, the quake has the potential to worsen a hunger crisis in the country. He said he had received reports of crops in the south destroyed by landslides in the aftermath of the earthquake.\n\n\u201cThis has not been a good year for Haiti,\u201d Bizimana said. \u201cIt\u2019s one crisis after another.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Leila Bourahla, Haiti\u2019s country director of Save the Children, said its staff on the ground saw \u201chorrific devastation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDozens of collapsed houses, numerous injured people and fatalities,\u201d Bourahla said. \u201cWhile it will take days to assess the full scale of the damage, it is clear that this is a massive humanitarian emergency.\u201d\n\nThe reported magnitude from the USGS was greater than the catastrophic 7.0-magnitude earthquake that hit seven miles west of Port-au-Prince in 2010, which resulted in more than 220,000 deaths. The quake on Saturday struck farther away from the densely populated capital. But the USGS noted that people in the most heavily hit areas largely reside in poorly constructed dwellings that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking.\n\nThe quake is set to deepen a humanitarian crisis in a country battling hunger, poverty and violence that never fully recovered from the 2010 temblor. After the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, 1.4 million Haitians required humanitarian assistance.\n\nU.N. agencies report 46 percent of the population is already experiencing acute or severe food insecurity \u2014 among the highest in the world. Aid agencies face massive hurdles to transport aid south of the capital, given the open gang warfare on National Road 2 \u2014 the nation\u2019s major western and southern artery.\n\nUntil last month, Haiti was one of a small number of countries in the world that had yet to roll out a coronavirus vaccination campaign \u2014 and the only country in the Americas. Meanwhile, coronavirus cases have surged as thousands fleeing violence have packed into overcrowded shelters around the capital.\n\nHaiti also entered a new period of political instability in the aftermath of the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in July.\n\nJose Luis Fernandez, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization representative in Haiti, said southern portions of the country were already facing \u201csevere and acute\u201d food shortages.\n\nThe earthquake \u201cwill worsen the food insecurity situation in the country, especially in areas of the south. There are pictures of many roads and bridges that have been destroyed. This is going to disrupt the flow of food.\u201d\n\nHaiti reeled from the quake even as the nation looked to the east with trepidation, with Tropical Storm Grace bearing down on the island nation. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, was poised to arrive sometime Monday, running a risk of heavy rainfall.\n\nFrantz Duval, editor-in-chief of Haiti\u2019s Le Nouvelliste newspaper, tweeted that two hotels were among the buildings destroyed in the town of Les Cayes. He said the local hospital was overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cSlowly, strongly and for very long seconds the earth shook in Haiti on 14 August, 2021 around 8:30 am,\u201d he wrote.\n\nReporters at Le Nouvelliste later said the majority of churches and hotels on the south coast had collapsed or suffered major damage.\n\nArchdeacon Abiade Lozama, head of an Episcopal church in Les Cayes, told the New York Times: \u201cThe streets are filled with screaming. People are searching, for loved ones or resources, medical help, water.\u201d\n\nLeila Bourahla, Haiti director of Save the Children, told the New York Times it would take days to assess the damage but \u201cit is clear that this is a massive humanitarian emergency\u201d.\n\nNaomi Verneus, a 34-year-old resident of the capital Port-au-Prince, told the Associated Press news agency she was woken up by the earthquake and that her bed was shaking.\n\n\u201cI woke up and didn\u2019t have time to put my shoes on. We lived [through] the 2010 earthquake and all I could do was run. I later remembered my two kids and my mother were still inside. My neighbour went in and told them to get out. We ran to the street,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 2010 earthquake in Haiti killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the economy.\n\nSaturday\u2019s earthquake comes amid a political crisis in the country, following the assassination of its president last month.\n\nTennis star Naomi Osaka, who is of Japanese and Haitian descent, tweeted her solidarity with Haiti.\n\nReferring to next week\u2019s Western & Southern Open, the four-time Grand Slam winner wrote: \u201cI\u2019m about to play a tournament this week and I\u2019ll give all the prize money to relief efforts for Haiti. I know our ancestors\u2019 blood is strong we\u2019ll keep rising",
          "summary": "Not less than 304 people are reported dead following a massive 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti on Saturday morning.\nNow, 11 years after the devastating 2010 earthquake, Haitians are again dealing with crushed bodies, collapsed buildings and overwhelmed hospitals.\nHaiti became a center for charities and nongovernmental organizations in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake.\nWe lived [through] the 2010 earthquake and all I could do was run.\nThe 2010 earthquake in Haiti killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the economy.",

          "text": "The financial inclusion drive of First Bank of Nigeria Limited has recorded a major boost, with the lender strengthening over 120,000 Firstmonie Agents, spread across 772 local government areas in the country with huge loan facilities.\n\nBarely a year after the launch of the Firstmonie Agents Credit scheme, First Bank, announced last week that it has economically empowered its Firstmonie Agents with the sum of N100 billion.\n\nFor a bank which prides itself as the nation\u2019s financial inclusion services provider and has pursued the financial inclusion drive of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the federal government with vigour, this may be another exciting way of matching words with action.\n\nAccording to World Bank, financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs \u2013 transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance \u2013 delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. World Bank also notes that access to a transaction account is a first step toward broader financial inclusion since it allows people to store, send and receive money.\n\nA few years ago, the CBN set a target of 80 percent financial inclusion by 2020. The objective was to get Nigerians who do not bank or do online transactions to get onboard as a way of reducing poverty in Nigeria.\n\nThe apex bank was concerned that while Nigeria has about 96.4 million adult population, it is sad that 40.1 million (almost half of the population) are financially excluded in a digital age where e-payment, e-commerce among other financial services products and banking innovations are trending.\n\nCBN also found it shocking that women, youths under 35 years, rural dwellers and those in Northern Nigerian, particularly North West and North East, are the most financially excluded. First Bank is clearly leaving no one in doubt that it is not any less concerned in this regard.\n\nThe Agent Credit scheme was created by the banking giant to promote and expand the business activities of its foremost agent banking platform \u2013 Firstmonie Agents \u2013 whilst putting them at an advantage to positively impact their immediate environment.\n\nReiterating the bank\u2019s role in deepening financial inclusion in the country, Chuma Ezirim, Group Executive, e-Business & Retail Products, said ,\u201cWe are truly excited about the tremendous impact of the Agent Credit on the performance of our Firstmonie Agents nationwide.\n\n\u201cSince the introduction of the Agent Credit to support our \u2018Human ATMs\u2019 as we fondly call our Firstmonie Agents, they have recorded immense growth in their businesses at levels they never envisaged in such a short period.\n\n\u201cOur key goal is to continue to deliver financial services to the underserved and unbanked populations, employing modern technology for processing real-time transactions and in doing so, contribute to building capacities and learning new skills in information technology, cash management and relationship management for our agents.\n\n\u201cWe encourage our Agents to keep being exemplary in setting the pace to promote financial inclusion as we collectively work towards the continuous growth and development of the national economy.\u201d\n\nFirstmonie Agents have been integral to bridging the financial inclusion gap, providing convenient banking services that are easily accessible, thereby saving time and travel costs for individuals in the suburbs and remote environments that have no access to financial services.\n\nThe bank\u2019s financial inclusion activities are in line with the mandate of the CBN to ensure the availability of affordable financial products and services to all individuals and groups of people in the country, irrespective of location, literacy levels, familiarity with technology and accessibility to modern infrastructural facilities.\n\nThe Firstmonie Agent channel is amongst the bank\u2019s many initiatives to expand financial access in the country. Not long ago, the lender announced that it had disbursed over N17bn loans to individuals across the country through FirstAdvance, its digital lending solution.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u2018First Bank reinforces its financial inclusion drive; disburses over 17bn naira loans through FirstAdvance.,\u2019 the lender explained, \u201cFirstAdvance is designed to offer a convenient and easy access to cash for salary earners whose accounts are domiciled with FirstBank and have received regular salaries for two months, prior to the loan request.\n\n\u201cIn barely a year since the launch of FirstAdvance, over 128,000 unique customers in over 782,996 successful transactions have so far benefitted from loans.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, FirstBank launched its agent banking network; \u2018Firstmonie Agent\u2019, described as its \u2018Human ATM\u2019. The Firstmonie Agents are empowered to extend access to finance to all Nigerians, regardless of where they may be across the country.\n\nThe agent banking network complements the bank\u2019s effort at reducing the size of the unbanked in the country, while providing a handful of the bank\u2019s bespoke financial services, including account opening; cash deposit; airtime purchase; bills payment; withdrawals and money transfer.",

Let us look ahead into the future and build a high-end and prudent platform for regional energy development,\u201d Tunis said.\n\nAnother major impediment as recognized by the Speaker was that businesses and individuals are not capitalizing on the opportunities in the sector, due to barriers, such as lack of awareness, as well as non-availability of resources.\n\nTherefore, it behooves on the regional body to facilitate information sharing, approaches and practical applications in effective energy management and above all develop the political will to make far-reaching commitments to galvanise member countries to key into a streamlined regional energy policy.\n\nWAPP, during its 15th General Assembly Session in Lome, Togo in 2020, tagged \u201cBuilding resilience against the effects of COVID-19 while advancing the realization of the WAPP Regional Electricity Market,\u201d emphasized on the increasing energy needs of the region.\n\nWhile most governments in West Africa have now set up Rural Electrification Agencies or Rural Electrification Funds, the impact of such organisations may be weakened by a lack of financial and technical expertise. It therefore calls for more robust financing without which the objective of energy efficiency may remain a mere dream.",

We don\u2019t expect the government to forget our children; we don\u2019t expect the military and the Federal Ministry of Education to forget our children.\n\n\u201cWe as their parents and the church and Christians in Kaduna State have not forgotten them. We know that well-meaning Nigerians are with us in prayers. Anybody who thinks they have been forgotten, we will continue to remind them that our children are not back, our 80 children are still in captivity.\n\n\u201cThis (Saturday) evening, one of the parents whose children are in captivity sent me words; how she has been diagnosed with a swollen heart. I told her that God will not allow her to die until her daughter comes back. I know it is the pain of what is going on that is causing all these new sickness, pains and problems because of her daughter being held in captivity.\u201d\n\nHayab said the association was praying and working hard to ensure the students are ferred, stating that negotiation with the bandits was ongoing but impeded by funds.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are communicating with the bandits, the bandits are actually talking. The only problem is that they are not coming down as we expect. They have been standing on their N80m for too long and the reality is that to raise N80m is difficult.\n\n\u201cWe have had cases where some people will say, \u2018how can I help you?\u2019 When they hear the N80m ransom, they become weak. We are not even asking anybody to give us the entire amount, but we need money since government cannot assist and we don\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cIf our government cannot go and rescue them, we need money to pay and get these children back. We believe that if we raise money, they will release these children. If anybody is moved to help us, we are here.\u201d\n\nThe bandits had on July 5, 2021, stormed the school located along the Kaduna-Kachia highway in the Chikun Local Government Area and whisked the students.\n\nThe proprietor, who is also the President, Kaduna Baptist Conference, Rev. Ishaya Jangado, disclosed that no fewer than 121 students were abducted by the bandits.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State Police Command has confirmed eight farmers were killed when bandits invaded Buruku and Udawa villages in Chikun Local Government Area.\n\nPolice spokesman in the state, ASP Mohammed Jalige, who confirmed the killings did not give details of the attack or give specific numbers of the casualties.\n\nJalige, however, said that the incident took place on Friday.\n\nBut a source who craved anonymity told our correspondents on Saturday that the bandits in large numbers invaded the two communities, shooting indiscriminately at anything at sight.\n\n\u201cThe bandits actually attacked the farmers while on their farms. The farmers were killed in separate attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source said five of the farmers were killed at Buruku along the dreaded Birinin Gwari \u2013 Kaduna highway, three of the farmers were killed by bandits at Udawa village.

          "text": "The Nigerian Army said that the uncomplimentary comments credited to Mrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba, the widow of late Col Ibrahim Sakaba that whose late husband was assassinated to cover up corruption are unfounded and baseless claims devoid of any fact.\n\nMrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba, alleged that the late senior officer was assassinated for refusing to loot funds meant for fighting the Boko Haram Insurgency.\n\nThe Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu in a statement said that while the NA is not interested in joining issues with anyone with respect to the enormous sacrifices made daily by its gallant troops, it is expedient to address the weighty allegations credited to the widow.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe Nigerian Army (NA) has been notified of an article making the rounds online, in which an allegation credited to Mrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba, the widow of late Col Ibrahim Sakaba alleged that the late senior officer was assassinated for refusing to loot funds meant for fighting the Boko Haram Insurgency. The late senior officer\u2019s widow was quoted to have made several uncomplimentary comments about the institution of the Nigerian Army (NA), making reference to unfounded and baseless claims devoid of any fact.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA is not interested in joining issues with anyone with respect to the enormous sacrifices made daily by our gallant troops, it is however expedient to address the weighty allegations credited to the widow. The NA acknowledges the emotional agony associated with losing loved ones and that cannot be quantified by any unit of measure.\n\n\u201cThe demise of late Col Ibrahim Sakaba, like those of other officers and soldiers who paid the supreme price in the war against terrorism in the North East, is one that is painful to the NA. These men and women died serving our nation, fighting to restore peace and stability in the North East. This is in tandem with the constitutional mandate of the Armed Forces of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nGeneral Nwachukwu noted that it will be totally a mischief and an assault on the psyche of the troops, who are relentlessly fighting, to begin to insinuate any plot against one of its own.\n\n\u201cAnd what is the plot here? That troops were led by their commander for an operational engagement is not a plot, as anyone may want to insinuate. Rather, it was a clear military mission with a clear objective. It is however disheartening that this gallant officer and some of his men paid the supreme price in the operation, and we pray fervently for the repose of their souls. Col Sakaba was a respected senior officer who gave his all in the defense of the freedom we all enjoy today. His demise is a great loss to all of us. Insinuating anything contrary is a deservice to our nation and the sacrifices of our troops.\n\n\u201cConcerning the issue of entitlements. Available records reveal the following incontrovertible facts:\n\n\u201cThat Master Samuel Ibrahim Sakaba, the son of Mrs. Seun Sakaba is the Next of Kin (NOK) to the late Senior Officer and the only child.\n\n\u201cAll entitlements meant to be paid by the NA have been paid to the NOK through Mrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba.\n\n\u201cAs at the time his entitlements were processed, Samuel was less than 6years as such, he was not benefiting from NA school sponsorship. However, now that he has reached the required age, he has been captured for payment of school sponsorship which will commence any moment from now. The NA will continue to sponsor the child\u2019s education up to graduation from university, as long as he fulfills the requirements outlined in the rules guiding the scheme.\n\n\u201cThe only entitlement owed Mrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba is the Group Life Assurance which is normally paid by the Insurance Company and which would soon be received along with that of other deceased personnel,\u201d the statement further explained.\n\nThe Nigerian Army also noted that it takes the welfare of its troops very seriously, as evident in the various welfare programs put in place for troops and their families.\n\nGeneral Nwachukwu added that the leadership has made the welfare of troops, one of the cardinal pillars of the COAS\u2019 vision for the NA.\n\n\u201cThis is visible in the various welfare programs embarked upon in addition to those that are statutorily emplaced. There are also well-established communication channels with families of deceased personnel.\n\n\u2018The NA under the leadership of the COAS, will continue to pursue the welfare of troops who are working round the clock to ensure the safety and security of all Nigerians. The NA will not be deterred, but remain focused in its pursuit of excellence and in ensuring that all Nigerians enjoy their God-given right to live freely anywhere in Nigeria,\u201d he conclueded.",

On Sunday morning they were being taken to the airport where they have been seen boarding six large military transport planes. The US has deployed 5,000 troops to help with the operation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has defended his decision to escalate the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying he could not justify an \u201cendless American presence in the middle of another country\u2019s civil conflict\u201d.\n\nReports on Sunday morning said the Taliban overran the city, the capital of Nangarhar province, without a shot being fired.\n\n\u201cThere are no clashes taking place right now in Jalalabad because the governor has surrendered to the Taliban,\u201d a local Afghan official told Reuters news agency.\n\n\u201cAllowing passage to the Taliban was the only way to save civilian lives.\u201d\n\nJournalist Tariq Ghazniwal tweeted images purportedly showing the provincial governor handing over control to the Taliban.\n\nThe capture of Jalalabad means the Taliban have secured the roads connecting the country with Pakistan.\n\nIt came hours after Mazar-i-Sharif \u2013 the capital of Balkh province and fourth-largest city in Afghanistan \u2013 also fell largely without a fight.\n\nAbas Ebrahimzada, a lawmaker from Balkh, told the Associated Press news agency that the national army were the first to surrender, which then prompted pro-government forces and other militia to give up.\n\nThe insurgents now control 23 of 34 provincial capitals.\n\nMore than a quarter of a million people have been displaced by the fighting and many have sought refuge in Kabul.\n\nSome who had fled areas controlled by the Taliban said militants there were demanding families hand over unmarried girls and women to become wives for their fighters.\n\nMuzhda, 35, a single woman who fled from Parwan to Kabul with her two sisters, said she would take her own life rather than let the Taliban force her to marry.\n\n\u201cI am crying day and night,\u201d she told AFP news agency.\n\nWomen from Taliban-held areas have also described being forced to wear burkas \u2013 one-piece veils that cover the face and body \u2013 and militants are reported to have beaten people for breaking social rules.\n\n\u201cGod forbid we will see war in Kabul,\u201d city resident Sayed Akbar, 53, told the New York Times. \u201cPeople here have gone through 40 years of sorrows.

          "text": "Ivory Coast has recorded its first case of the Ebola hemorrhagic virus in 25 years, according to the country\u2019s health minister.\n\nOn Saturday, Pierre N\u2019Gou Dimba said on national television that officials confirmed the case after testing samples from an 18-year-old female who travelled from neighbouring Guinea.\n\n\u201cThis is an isolated and imported case,\u201d he said, adding that the patient was currently being treated in intensive care in Abidjan, the commercial capital.\n\nIn a separate statement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the case was Ivory Coast\u2019s first Ebola infection since 1994.\n\n\u201cThis came after the Institut Pasteur in Ivory Coast confirmed the Ebola Virus Disease in samples collected from a patient, who was hospitalized in the commercial capital of Abidjan, after arriving from Guinea,\u201d the WHO said in the statement.\n\nThe WHO said initial investigations found the patient had travelled to Ivory Coast by road and arrived in Abidjan on August 12.\n\n\u201cThe patient was admitted to a hospital after experiencing a fever and is currently receiving treatment,\u201d it said.\n\nGuinea \u2013 site of the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, the deadliest on record \u2013 experienced a four-month Ebola outbreak earlier this year that was declared over on June 19.\n\nGuinea early this week also confirmed a first case of the Marburg virus in West Africa. Marburg virus disease is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola.\n\nTransmission of both diseases occurs through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissue, while symptoms include headache, vomiting blood, muscle pains and bleeding.\n\nThe WHO said there was no indication the current case in Ivory Coast is linked to the outbreak in Guinea earlier this year. It said further investigation and genomic sequencing will identify the strain and determine if there was a connection.\n\n\u201cIt is of immense concern that this outbreak has been declared in Abidjan, a metropolis of more than 4 million people,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, much of the world\u2019s expertise in tackling Ebola is here on the continent and Ivory Coast can tap into this experience and bring the response to full speed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe WHO said it was helping to coordinate a cross-border response, which included transferring 5,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine from Guinea to Ivory Coast.",

People are searching, for loved ones or resources, medical help, water.\u201d\n\nPhotos shared on social media showed damaged buildings and piles of rubble after the quake.\n\nLeila Bourahla, Haiti director of Save the Children, told the New York Times it would take days to assess the damage but \u201cit is clear that this is a massive humanitarian emergency\u201d.\n\nNaomi Verneus, a 34-year-old resident of the capital Port-au-Prince, told the Associated Press news agency she was woken up by the earthquake and that her bed was shaking.\n\n\u201cI woke up and didn\u2019t have time to put my shoes on. We lived [through] the 2010 earthquake and all I could do was run. I later remembered my two kids and my mother were still inside. My neighbour went in and told them to get out. We ran to the street,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 2010 earthquake in Haiti killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the economy.\n\nSaturday\u2019s earthquake comes amid a political crisis in the country, following the assassination of its president last month.\n\nTennis star Naomi Osaka, who is of Japanese and Haitian descent, tweeted her solidarity with Haiti.\n\nReferring to next week\u2019s Western & Southern Open, the four-time Grand Slam winner wrote: \u201cI\u2019m about to play a tournament this week and I\u2019ll give all the prize money to relief efforts for Haiti.
