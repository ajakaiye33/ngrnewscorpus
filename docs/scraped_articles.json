          "text": "The House of Representatives has urged the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba; Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Air Staff, Isiaka Amao, and other security agencies to deploy their personnel to comb of the entire Lilu, Azia, Orsumoghu, and Mbosi communities in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State.\n\nThe operation, the House stated, is in order to \u201cmove into and dislodge the camps housing hundreds of kidnap victims, and without delay, rescue the victims, including Mr. Steady Idisi and Emmanuel Ifie.\u201d\n\nThe House also mandated its Committee on Police Affairs, Army and Air Force and other relevant committees to ensure compliance thereof and report back within two weeks for further legislative action.\n\nThe resolutions were sequel to the unanimous adoption of a motion of urgent public importance moved by a member, Ben Igbakpa, titled \u2018Matter of urgent national importance on the need to address the spate of insecurity and abduction of innocent citizens of Nigeria and for the immediate release of kidnapped victims including Rotarian Steady Idisi and Emmanuel Ifie.\u2019\n\nMoving the motion, Igbakpa regretted \u201cthe increasing spate of kidnapping and banditry, which has rendered our nation inhabitable for both citizens and foreigners alike.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that on February 20, 2022, Idisi, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Lonestar Drilling Company Limited, President of Steady Run Club and a notable Rotarian; and his friend, Ifie, were kidnapped at Orsumoghu in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cUp until date, their whereabouts remain unknown,\u201d he noted.\n\nIgbakpa further recalled that Idisi, on the said date, checked out of his hotel room in Asaba, in company with his friend, Ifie, and proceeded on their journey back to Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThey encountered gunmen suspected to be IPOB militants at Orsumoghu in Ihiala LGA of Anambra State,\u201d the lawmaker added.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe House is concerned that a well-known Nnewi businessman, Chief Gab Ofoma, was on February 20, 2022, killed along the same road by men suspected to be members of the same gang of unknown gunmen terrorising the area.\n\n\u201cThe House is worried that several efforts made to locate Mr. Steady Idisi and Emmanuel Ifie have so far proved abortive, as their whereabouts is still uncertain, and the victims may be held in captivity in a camp deep in the Orsumoghu Forest where, by the account of an escapee, there is electricity, generators, SUVs and it is like a city of its own, where evil reigns.\n\n\u201cBy the same account, over 100 persons are held captive in that camp and are killed intermittently at the pleasure of the bandits.\n\n\u201cThe House is further worried that a situation where non-state actors rule over and dictate the conduct of citizens in a democratic country has been foisted on us. It is unacceptable and must be stopped by legitimate agents of the state entrusted with the security of lives and properties.\u201d\n\nIgbakpa noted that a \u201cproperly coordinated and concerted inter-agency intelligence-driven effort\u201d by the Police, Army and other security agencies in the form of a joint operation to \u201ccontinually raid the entire area, as was done in the past,\u201d is critical to address the menace and in order to dislodge the bandits and rescue their victims.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) says COVID-19 pandemic has triggered 25 per cent increase in anxiety and depression globally in the first year of the pandemic.\n\nThe UN health agency\u2019s new report suggested that the greatest deterioration in mental health took place in the areas worst-hit by COVID-19 -where infections were high and social interaction was restricted.\n\n\u201cThe information we have now about the impact of COVID-19 on the world\u2019s mental health is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General told journalists on Wednesday.\n\nCalling it a \u201cwake-up call to all countries to pay more attention to mental health and do a better job of supporting their populations\u2019 mental health,\u201d Ghebreyesus said, \u201cthe effects of the pandemic go far beyond the death and disease caused by the virus itself.\u201d\n\nThe scientific brief released on Wednesday also highlighted who had been most affected and summarised the impact of the pandemic on the availability of mental health services and how this changed during the first 12 months of the pandemic.\n\nHighlighting those concerns about potential increases in mental health conditions had already prompted 90 per cent of countries surveyed, to include mental health and psychosocial support in their COVID-19 response plans, WHO said that major gaps and concerns remained.\n\nCiting the unprecedented stress caused by social isolation as a major explanation for the increase, WHO said that loneliness, suffering and deaths in the family, grief after bereavement together with financial worries, were also major factors fuelling anxiety and depression.\n\nAmong health workers, exhaustion had been a major trigger prompting suicidal thoughts, the report stated.\n\nIndicating that females were more affected than males \u2013 and that younger people, especially those aged between 20 and 24, were more affected than older adults \u2013 the report also revealed that young people are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviour.\n\nIt also outlined that people with pre-existing physical health conditions, such as asthma, cancer, and heart disease, were more likely to develop symptoms of mental disorders.\n\n\u201cThis increase in the prevalence of mental health problems coincided with severe disruptions to mental health services, and underscored chronic underinvestment in mental health, leaving huge gaps in care for those who need it most,\u201d Ghebreyesus said in his remarks on the report.\n\nReminding that by the end of 2021, some services had been restored, he added that too many people remained unable to get the care and support they needed.\n\nWHO had been working with partners to lead an inter-agency response to the mental health impacts of COVID-19, by providing guidance, tools and resources for responders and the general public, and by supporting countries to integrate mental health and psychosocial services.\n\nAccording to the UN health agency, many people have sought support online, signalling an urgent need to make reliable and effective digital tools available and easily accessible.\n\nHowever, developing and deploying digital interventions remained a major challenge in resource-limited countries and settings.\n\nThe UN agency\u2019s most recent Mental Health Atlas showed that in 2020, governments worldwide spent on average just over two per cent of their health budgets on mental health.\n\nMany low-income countries reported having fewer than one mental health worker per 100,000 people, leading WHO to call for a major global step up in investment.\n\n\u201cWhile the pandemic has generated interest in and concern for mental health, it has also revealed historical under-investment in mental health services.\n\n\u201cCountries must act urgently to ensure that mental health support is available to all,\u201d D\u00e9vora Kestel, WHO\u2019s Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Use said.\n\n\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Oil money\n\n.As Ukraine crisis deepens\n\nBy Udeme Akpan, Energy Editor\n\nTHE prices of many crudes, yesterday, surged toward $120 per barrel on the decisions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC.\n\nThis was even as many buyers decided to shun Russian crudes, amid concerns about supply disruptions.\n\nSpecifically, the prices of Bonny Light, Brent, WTI, rose to $107, $111 and $109 per barrel, from $98, $104 and $108 per barrel respectively, yesterday.\n\nIt a statement obtained by Vanguard, OPEC, stated at the end of its 26th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, that, \u201cFollowing the conclusion of the 26th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, held via videoconference on 2 March 2022, and based on internal consultation held exclusively by the OPEC and participating non-OPEC oil-producing countries in the Declaration of Cooperation of (DoC), it was noted that current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook pointed to a well-balanced market, and that current volatility is not caused by changes in market fundamentals but by current geopolitical developments.\u201d\n\nIt also stated: \u201cThe OPEC and participating non-OPEC oil-producing countries decided to reaffirm the decision of the 10th Ministerial Meeting on 12 April 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings including the 19th Ministerial Meeting on 18 July 2021.\n\n\u201cReconfirm the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th Ministerial Meeting and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mb/d for the month of April 2022, as per the attached schedule.\n\n\u201cReiterate the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism taking advantage of the extension of the compensation period until the end of June 2022. Compensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the statement of the 15th Ministerial Meeting.\n\n\u201cHold the 27th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 31 March 2022.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, had, said the increase in prices of crude oil is not in the best interest of Nigeria.\n\nReacting to the rising prices of crudes, including Brent, which rose to $103.33, from $96 per barrel in the global market, he had said Nigeria will be comfortable with prices ranging between $70 and $80 per barrel.\n\nSpecifically, he had said: \u201cWe are hopeful the prices will move around, maybe $80, maybe $70. We are hoping it will come down to somewhere around $70 to $80, which will be sustainable for us to the end of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the nation had agreed to voluntarily cut its daily crude oil production by 939,000 barrels between January and March after a meeting with the crucial meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe inability of Nigeria to activate the oil wells it shut down when OPEC instructed producing countries to cut production, as well as the lack of investment in the upstream sector, are affecting the nation.\u201d\n\nHe also, said: \u201cWe are working hard on that (production increase). What happened to us was the fact that we had to cut back at the time, and, of course, in such a way you can\u2019t cut back mathematically.\n\n\u201cSo, you want to cut back 100,000 barrels that you shut out, maybe we\u2019ll shut down about 200,000 to 300,000 barrels. So, at the end of the day, we over-complied because we just couldn\u2019t achieve it mathematically.\n\n\u201cIn trying to cut down, we cut down too much. And now to come back, it\u2019s not been easy for us to get the wells back to production.\u201d\n\nHe said, a lot of additional investments would be needed to ramp up production, but he lamented that foreign funding was drying fizzling out for the industry.\n\nSimilarly, in an interview with Vanguard, Energy Partner at Bloomfield Law Practice, Ayodele Oni had also explained that the rising crude oil prices have positive and negative implications to Nigeria as a country.\n\nHe had said: \u201cThe positive aspect is that our revenue increases. Looking at the crude oil benchmark in Nigeria\u2019s budget, it is obvious that we will earn much more than we expected but the setback is that we are not refining crude in-country at the moment, as the four refineries are still under rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWith this situation, we will spend more on importation of refined products and the subsidy payment will also increase substantially which is a big problem for us. This development will affect our income, revenue and also increase our expenditure.\n\n\u201cThis rising crude oil price is more disadvantageous than advantageous to Nigeria because we do not refine locally. If we are refining sufficiently locally it will be a blessing to us.\u201d\n\nAs regards the pricing, Oni stated that he foresees the crude oil price to rise further to $115 per barrel, but it will still drop to $80 or below.\n\nIn another interview with Vanguard, a Consultant at BL&C Limited, Bode Longe, had added that, \u201cThis is positive for us as a country considering the oil benchmark figure, and the actual price of crude in the international market. This is supposed to increase the Excess Crude Account, ECA, savings account.\n\n\u201cThe ECA operates in a way that, if the actual oil revenue is greater than the budgeted oil revenue, we save to the ECA, but if the actual oil revenue is less than the budgeted oil revenue, we withdraw from the ECA.\n\n\u201cThe slight challenge is, rather than follow through the deregulation of the PMS market from February 1, 2022, the government seems to have backed and pushed the implementation of the petroleum industry Act, PIA, for another 18 months.\n\n\u201cThe real challenge is that the savings which we would have gotten from the higher price of crude will be fritter away in terms of subsidy payment, since NNPC has proposed N3 trillion for subsidy support.\n\n\u201cWhile the better thing to have done is to bite the bullet and deal with this subsidy issue once, so we can actual create a foreign reserve to support us when the oil price drops again, but as usual the government doing things the way it does, we are going to fritter it away into subsidy payment and when the oil price plunges, we are back again to where we are.\u201d",

Sometimes we read in the newspapers where people from the same party are fighting themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think that it will be a very healthy development for us to gather the momentum that we require to take over. So, I believe that it is the unity that we need to get the power.\n\n\u201cSo, I charge all of us to go out there and with one voice talk about what will unite Nigeria and not what will divide Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou happen to be the second person out of the presidential hopefuls to see us and ask for our support.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that at the appointed time, the caucus that you know will speak with one voice and our voice will be heard\u201d, Elumelu said.\n\nA former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim had, a few weeks ago, held a similar parley with the lawmakers.\n\nLike Atiku, Anyim is also seeking the presidential ticket of the PDP to contest the 2023 election.",

Through the years, miracles of every kind have been commonplace in his ministry,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernors Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Yahaya Bello (Kogi) praised the cleric for using the gospel to impact the lives of millions of people across the world.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cSir, you have been a blessing, not just to the RCCG, but also to us in Lagos State. Your unceasing prayers for us and your wise counsel over the years have contributed in no small measure to the phenomenal progress our state has continued to witness. We will forever be grateful. We cannot also ever forget your commitment to the Lagos State Annual Thanksgiving Service since the Year 2000.\u201d\n\nIn his message, Abiodun said: \u201cClearly, you are a living testimony of the awesomeness of God and our dear nation and State have benefitted immensely from your wealth of experience and selfless services in both your spiritual and secular lives and living.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement in Akure, the state capital, by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Richard Olatunde, said: \u201cYou have continued to influence many lives positively, projecting the Christian values with dedication for the development of the country at large.\n\n\u201cYour ministry has attracted many souls to God, decimating the kingdom of darkness amid the cloud of a dwindling value.\u201d\n\nBello, in a statement in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, by his Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Mohammed, said: \u201cI am always wowed by the simplicity and sense of humility of this man of influence, his good works are testimonies of his divine calling, impacting greatly on humanity, education, health and infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cIt is no doubt that Pastor Adeboye is a blessing to Nigeria and the entire globe.\u201d\n\nLagos State House of Assembly Speaker Mudashiru Obasa said: \u201cMany people will hardly believe that you are already 80 because your physical strength still remains intact. I have never seen you read the Bible or any other material with difficulty. Indeed, your gait confirms your strength.\n\n\u201cThis has proved the word of God that He will bless those He will bless.\u201d\n\nGani Adams wrote: \u201cYour years of service to the Lord and the attendant grace remain an inspiration to others that look up to you as a role model.\n\n\u201cReaching four scores in life is a testimony of God\u2019s grace and abundant blessings.

          "text": "Govt kicks off process for Kyari\u2019s extradition to U.S.\n\nMalami asks court to okay requests\n\nCop challenges 14 days detention order\n\nNigeria has approved the request by the United States for the extradition of suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abba Kyari.\n\nA grand jury, last April 29, filed an indictment against Kyari with the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nA deputy clerk of the court issued a warrant of arrest for him.\n\nKyari is wanted to stand trial for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft.\n\nHe was accused of conspiring with a United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based Nigerian, Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi to commit the crime.\n\nYesterday, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), filed an application before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court in Abuja for Kyari\u2019s extradition.\n\nThe application marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022 was filed under the Extradition Act.\n\nThe AGF said the application followed a request by the Diplomatic Representative of the U.S. Embassy in Abuja.\n\nIt is \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Alhaji Kyari, who is a subject in a superseding three counts indictment\u201d.\n\nKyari and five other police officers are undergoing interrogation by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) over a cocaine deal.\n\nLast week, a court endorsed further 14-day detention for the suspects.\n\nIn the affidavit filed in support of the extradition application, the AGF stated that he was satisfied that provision is made by the laws of the U.S. such that so long as Kyari has not had a reasonable opportunity of returning to Nigeria, he will not be detained or tried for any offence committed before his surrender other than the extradition offence which can be proved by the fact on which his surrender is sought.\n\nHe added that he was satisfied that the offence in respect of which Kyari\u2019s surrender is sought is not political nor is it trivial.\n\nThe AGF also expressed satisfaction that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nHe added that Kyari, \u201cif surrendered, will not be prejudiced at his trial and will not be punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty, by reason of his race, nationality or political opinions\u201d.\n\nThe AGF said having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it will not be unjust or oppressive, or be too severe a punishment, to surrender him.\n\nMalami said he was also satisfied that Kyari has been accused of the offence for which his surrender is sought.\n\nHe noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence.\n\nAccording to court documents, the three count-charge marked: 2:21-cr-00203-RGK, was filed on April 29, 2021, before the US District Court for the Central District of California, USA.\n\nThe charge filed along with the extradition application, sighted by The Nation, reads:\n\n\u2022 Count one: Conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1349, carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years;\n\n\u2022 Count two: Conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of Title 18, United States Code Section 1956(h), carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.\n\n\u2022 Count three: Aggravated identity theft, and aiding and abetting that offence, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1028A(a)(1) and 2(a), carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of two years.\n\nIn the request for Kyari\u2019s extradition, the U.S. Embassy stated: \u201cOn April 29, 2021, based on the indictment filed by the grand jury and with the approval of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, a deputy clerk of the court issued a warrant of arrest for Kyari.\n\n\u201cThe arrest warrant remains valid and executable to apprehend Kyari for the crimes with which he is charged in the indictment.\n\n\u201cKyari is wanted to stand trial in the United States for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, and identity theft.\n\n\u201cKyari is the subject of an indictment in case Number 2:21-cr-00203 (also referred to as 2:21-MJ-00760 and 2:21-CR-00203-RGK), filed April 29, 2021, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\u201d\n\nThe embattled \u201csuper-cop\u201d has challenged the order made on February 22 by Justice Zainab Abubakar of the Federal High Court, Abuja empowering NDLEA to detain him for 14 days in the first instance.\n\nIn an application filed by his lawyers, Kyari wants the court to set aside the order for his detention, arguing that the order was issued without him being accorded a fair hearing.\n\nThe court has scheduled a hearing in Kyari\u2019s application for March 8.",

          "text": "By Cosmas Omegoh, Lagos\n\nAs the Catholic community observes Ash Wednesday marking the beginning of the 40-day Christian fast, the Archbishop of the Metropolitan See of Lagos, Most Rev Dr Alfred Adewale Martins, has issued guidelines to help the faithful in their walk with God, while adding the intention of Pope Francis for all to pray for peace in Ukraine.\n\nIn a release, the cleric reminded his flock that the month of March leads everyone into the special season of Lent, during which a call goes out for all to deepen their relationship with God through prayer, fasting and alms-giving.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nHe noted that \u2018with the Ash Wednesday (March 2) the Church ushers all into the solemn season of Lent to experience the profound call to repentance and renewal. This month presents us with these important feast days: St. Patrick (17th March), St Joseph, the Husband of Blessed Virgin Mary (19th March), Annunciation of the Lord (25th March).\u2019\n\nWhile recalling the need for fervent prayers, he said: \u201cOur Holy Father, Pope Francis has called on all Catholics to take 2nd March 2022 as a day of prayer and fasting for Ukraine. We are, therefore, enjoined to offer our fasting and prayers on that day for the restoration of peace in Ukraine and other parts of the world.\u2019\n\nHe reminded the faithful of their Lenten obligations saying: \u2018As we begin the season of lent, may I remind everyone of the following regarding the season: Abstinence: All the faithful who have reached 14 years of age and above are required to abstain totally from meat or favourite dish or drink on Ash Wednesday (March 2) and Good Friday (April 15) and all Fridays in Lent.\n\n\u2018All the faithful between the ages of 18 and 60 years are obliged to fast. In practice, fasting involves limiting oneself to a single full meal or two smaller meals a day. Those who are sick, pregnant or nursing or whose health would adversely be affected by fasting should not consider themselves bound by this norm.\n\n\u2018Parents and teachers are responsible for helping young persons, who are not bound by the norms regarding fasting and abstinence to recognise the genuine sense in penance and self-denial.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

These are rights enjoyed by every Nigerian except women.\n\n\u2018The proposed gender bills in the 5th Constitution Alteration Bills that were all rejected are Bills targeted at addressing the current gender imbalance across the legislative arm of governments across the country whilst reducing the under-representation of women in political office.\n\n\u2018The men of the 9th NASS have reinforced the discrimination and political bias against women as enshrined in the 1999 constitution by:\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "\u2022South-east seeks national secretary, South-west divided\n\n\u2022Chairmanship aspirants disagree on convention date, write Buhari\n\n\u2022Governors agree on zoning list\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari met with governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday at State House, Abuja, where he expressed his preference for former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as consensus candidate for the office of APC national chairman.\n\nThe meeting with the state chief executives was called to discuss the forthcoming national convention of the party scheduled for March 26, among other issues.\n\nAPC stakeholders from the South-east pushed for the office of National Secretary, while the South-west, where the office was originally zoned, was still divided over the party position.\n\nHowever, under the latest agreement reached by the Governors yesterday at their meeting after the meeting with Buhari, all the previous positions in the party held by members from the North-west would now go to those from the South-east; all positions that were held by those in the North-east would go to those in the South-west; and all positions previously held by those from the North-central would automatically go to those from the South-south. Therefore, the position of party secretary and chairman were dealt with.\n\nIt was agreed that Adamu would be National Chairman.\n\nThe president\u2019s only preference was Adamu as National Chairman, and for the rest positions, he asked the stakeholders to go and decide.\n\nSome of the APC governors at the meeting wanted the March 26 date proposed for the party\u2019s national convention to remain as planned, but some aspirants for the party positions wrote to the president to halt plans for the convention.\n\nAlthough it would have been Buni\u2019s preferred plan to hold the convention and presidential primary same time, that is no longer feasible given INEC\u2019s timetable and time constraint.\n\nAt the meeting attended by 11 of the 22 APC governors at the president\u2019s office, Buhari was said to have turned down the governors\u2019 request for him to have a rethink on his support for Adamu as national chairman of the party.\n\nThe president, who met with the governors shortly before departing for Nairobi, Kenya, to attend a four-day international summit, said no to the attempt by the governors to get him to change his mind on the former Nasarawa State governor. He was said to have bluntly refused to shift ground, when the governors advanced their reasons against the ranking senator emerge as national chairman.\n\nThe governors were said to have expressed their desire to allow all those that have signified interest in the national chairmanship of the party to run, which the president rejected.\n\nThe engagement provided an avenue for South-east APC governors to complain about the zoning of the office of the national secretary to South-west rather than their region.\n\nChairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, who led the team to the meeting with Buhari, was said to have told them that it was too late to amend the zoning formula.\n\nIn spite of the position of the chairman of PGF, the South-east governors resolved to take their agitation for the party scribe to a meeting of the APC governors that was scheduled to hold next Tuesday at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja.\n\nThe Tuesday evening\u2019s meeting, expected to be attended by the 22 APC governors, will take another look at the totality of the forthcoming national convention with regard to the zoning arrangement for the offices.\n\nApart from Bagudu, other APC governors at the meeting were Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Aminu Masari (Katsina), Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Hope Uzodinma (Imo), Gboyega Oyetola (Osun), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Sani Bello (Niger), Umar Ganduje (Kano), and outing deputy governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke.\n\nBuni absent at meeting\n\nAt the end of the meeting with Buhari, the governors affirmed that there was no plan to move the national convention from the scheduled date of March 26, in Abuja. This was despite the tight timeframe provided by the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) released for next year\u2019s general election.\n\nThere had been speculations that a section of the party was pushing for the postponement of the national convention so that both the election of the national executives and the primaries to select its candidates for the 2023 elections could be done simultaneously.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after the meeting with the president, Bagudu assured that the party would maintain the March 26 date for the exercise. He said the governors met with the president to congratulate him for signing the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and also on the victory of APC in some of the by-elections conducted over the weekend.\n\nOn whether the idea of further postponement of the convention was discussed at the meeting, Bagudu stated, \u201cLast week, we were in this hall (villa), about 20 APC governors, and this question came up and we clearly said we came to discuss the national convention, which is slated for March 26, and are working hard to ensure that on March 26, we have our convention and elect our national officers and that remains the case.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed speculation that the APC state chief executives were still divided over the direction of the party especially, after what seemed to be an altercation among them as they emerged from the meeting with the president.\n\nBagudu stated, \u201cThere\u2019s no altercation, I\u2019m not aware of any. Mallam Nasiru (Kaduna State governor), again last week, answered that. Look, if by altercation people are talking about differences of opinion before a decision is arrived at, then, maybe, that is what people can\u2026 but as a body, the 22 governors of APC are united behind the party and behind Mr. President.\u201d\n\nOn the essence of the meeting on Tuesday, Bagudu explained, \u201cToday, Tuesday, 1st of March, a number of APC governors came to Mr. President to, among others, congratulate him on signing the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThis is something many Nigerians have expressed different views about, but Mr. President had once again taken the courageous step of, even while having observations, he signed and requested the National Assembly to look at it. So, we congratulate the National Assembly for passage of the amendments and equally congratulate Mr. President for signing the amendment.\n\n\u201cSecondly, our party, the All Progressives Congress, participated in a number of by-elections over the last weekend and equally, we congratulated Mr. President and in addition, we spoke about other issues that concern our party.\u201d\n\nBagudu dismissed insinuations that governors were still not comfortable with certain provisions of the Act, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve always had cause to address this. There was no time; legislation, everywhere in the world, is based on continuous improvement. Constitutions that are 200 years old are subject to reviews sometimes and those reviews are not cut and dry. Even people, who truly believe in the need for legislation may have worries about the implications of it.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we\u2019re never against the principle of amending laws. They (governors) are never against the National Assembly, but even among the National Assembly, there\u2019s debate. To imagine that there is some legislation that is punitive to the governors or to the National Assembly, I think that will be tantamount to negation of the Oath of Office, whoever is participating in doing that.\u201d\n\nAccording to a senior official of the APC caretaker committee, \u201cAs you know, our party is already fragmented along different interest groups. It is expected that there will be serious crisis within the party after the national convention fixed for March 26. And we don\u2019t have enough time to resolve the crisis before the presidential primary that will start on April 4.\n\n\u201cSo, our reasoning is that if we hold the national convention and presidential primary same day, we will have almost eight months to resolve the crises that will emanate from both the national convention and the presidential primary before the campaign starts \u2013 in line with INEC\u2019s timetable.\u201d\n\nThe APC chieftain added that almost all members of the interim committee and some governors had keyed into this news idea, saying it would be \u201csuicidal for the party to go ahead\u201d with the national convention fixed for March 26.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is to see how we can manage our crisis. We don\u2019t want to have a sharply divided party that will be going into campaign and elections. And we hope to present this case to our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, for approval in the next few days.\u201d\n\nAnother source also claimed that the fresh plot to hold the national convention and the presidential primary same day had always been the \u201cagenda\u201d of Buni-led caretaker committee.\n\nThe source said, \u201cWe are aware of the new move by some members of the caretaker committee. That has always been their agenda. They really want to conduct the presidential primary and the convention the same day, so that they can benefit from it. Let\u2019s see how it goes.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a group under the auspices of All Progressive Congress (APC) Action Group demanded that the presidential primary and the national convention of APC be held on the same date.\n\nThe group, in a statement yesterday by its Publicity Secretary, Mr. Bisi Olanipekun, said there was need to save money for the party and to shield party members from expending so much resources for the two events that could be held in a day.\n\nAspirants Write Buhari, Want National Convention Halted\n\nThe Forum of All Progressive Congress (APC) Aspirants for National Convention wrote to President Muhammadu Buhari and urged him to halt the forthcoming national convention of the party slated for March 26. The aspirants, in the letter jointly signed yesterday by the forum\u2019s President and Secretary, Mr. Tolulope Ashafa and Mr. Usman Adamu, respectively, alleged that four APC governors were planning to bring the convention forward by holding it earlier than planned.\n\nThe aspirants said the development would make the APC unable to give the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) the 30-day notice required by law for it to hold the convention.\n\nThe forum said the prediction that the Electoral Act 2022 would cause the demise of APC was anchored not on the content of the legislation but the unholy manipulations going on in the party.\n\nThe forum stated, \u201cWe crave your patience to recall the near toxic wrangling over the timing of APC\u2019s National Convention. But for the wisdom of Mr. President, who sided with critical stakeholders on the need to hold the convention at a more auspicious time, a gang of state governors had arrogated the power of decision to themselves and were going to force the gathering through without minding the consequences on the party, the country\u2019s democracy, and Your Excellency\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufai, Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State are among the members of the cartel that has put its interest over that of our great party by trying to forcefully conduct the convention in a manner that would have sabotaged the APC but for your timely intervention.\u201d\n\nThe forum alleged that these governors were exploiting the names of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and the president to promote one candidate above the others in a manner that completely negated the neutrality that the president had embodied in the handling of political decisions in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Senate passes 49 out of 68 constitution bills\n\n\u2022Moves prisons, railways, power generation from exclusive to concurrent list\n\n\u2022Rejects pension for parliament presiding officers\n\n\u2022Says states free to collect VAT\n\n\u2022Empowers NASS, state assemblies to summon president, govs\n\n\u2022 Turns down proposal for special seats for women in legislature\n\n\u2022Okays independent candidature for elections\n\n\u2022 Approves separation of AGF, Justice Minister offices\n\nSunday Aborisade, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nMembers of the National Assembly yesterday voted on the report of its Joint Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution (Fifth Alteration) Bills, 2022, which consisted of 68 bills.\n\nThe Senate passed a total of 49 bills out of the 68 considered during voting on the Constitution bills. These included moving prisons, railways and power generation from the Exclusive to Concurrent list.\n\nAlso, the federal lawmakers at the end of the exercise, approved financial autonomy for state legislatures, judiciary and local governments (LGs) in the country.\n\nThe eight National Assembly had during the amendment carried out on the 1999 Constitution, passed similar bills to empower the LGs, state legislature and the judiciary, but could not scale through when they were transmitted to the state assemblies for concurrence.\n\nProbably disturbed by the development, President Muhammadu Buhari had on Friday, May 23, 2020, signed into law an Executive Order to grant financial autonomy to the legislature and the judiciary across the 36 states of the country. The order also mandated the Accountant-General of the federation to deduct from source amount due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation to each state for states that refuse to grant such autonomy.\n\nThe Executive Order No. 10 of 2020, made it mandatory that all states of the federation should include the allocations of both the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets.\n\nThe Attorney-General for the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami had said a Presidential Implementation Committee had been constituted to fashion out strategies and modalities for the implementation of financial autonomy for the State Legislature and State Judiciary in compliance with section 121(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as Amended).\n\nHe had also said consideration was given to all other applicable laws, instruments, conventions and regulations that provided for financial autonomy at the states.\n\nHowever, in a split decision of six Justices to one, the Supreme Court, had on February 12, 2022, nullified Executive Order 10 initiated by Buhari to grant financial autonomy to the State Judiciary and legislature.\n\nThe apex court had held that Executive Order 10 was inconsistent with the 1999 Constitution and therefore unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect\n\nHowever, civil society organisations led by the Executive Director of Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, who monitored proceedings at the National Assembly yesterday, expressed mixed feelings over the development\n\nRafsanjani said, \u201cWe in the CSOs are really not excited over the issue. We believe that the governors would once again influence the state legislature to reject the bills despite the fact that it would be in their favour.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the lawmakers during the session witnessed by the wife of the President, Hajia Aishat Buhari and the wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, rejected bills to empower women in politics.\n\nThey equally turned down attempt to empower presiding officers of the legislature to enjoy life pension.\n\nThe federal lawmakers equally rejected bills to provide for the removal of presiding officers of the legislature; and to change the name of Barikin Ladi Local Government Area in Plateau State to \u201cGwol\u201d Local Government Area.\n\nBoth Senate and House of Representatives Special Ad Hoc Committees on the Review of the 1999 Constitution, last week laid its report and recommended 68 amendments.\n\nThe recommendations were based on private members, executive bills and memoranda received from the public during its zonal public hearings. Out of the 360 members in the House, as at commencement of voting, 290 members were present in the chambers.\n\nWhile one voted against, 286 voted in support of the bill to alter the provisions of the constitution to abrogate the state joint local government account and provide for a special account into which shall be paid all Allocations due to LGs from the Federation Account and from the Government of the State, surpassing 240, the two third majority needed for the passage.\n\nAlso, 258 members voted in support of the Bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the to establish LG as a tier of Government and Guarantee their Democratic Existence and Tenure.\n\nFor the Financial Independence of State Houses of Assembly and State Judiciary, 296 members voted in favour of the proposal.\n\nThe lawmakers also voted in favour of establishing the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and of the State to separate it from the office of the Minister of Justice or Commissioner for Justice for State in order to make the offices of the Attorney General independent and insulated from partisanship. While 259 voted in support, 44 voted against.\n\nFurthermore, 269 lawmakers voted in support of independent candidacy in presidential, governorship, National Assembly, State Houses of Assembly and local government council elections.\n\nThey also approved a bill to provide for the Office of Mayor for the Federal Capital Territory Administration Abuja. 245 lawmakers voted in support while 53 voted against.\n\nIn a similar vein, majority of members approved the Bills for Acts to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution to Change the names of Afikpo North and Afikpo South Local Government Areas; Kunchi Local Government Area; Egbado North and Egbado South Local Government Areas; Barikin Ladi Local Government Area; Atigbo Local government Area; Obia/Akpor Local Government Area; and for Related Matters.\n\nOther proposals the lawmakers voted in support of included, \u201ca bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Move Airports from Exclusive Legislative List to the Concurrent Legislative List, a Bill to Establish State Security Council; and for Related Matters, to Empower the National Assembly and State House of Assembly Powers to Summon the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Governors of States to answer Questions on issues on which the National and State Assembly have the Power to make Law, a Bill to reduce the period within which the President or the Governor of a State may authorize the withdrawal of Monies from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in the absence of an Appropriation Act from six months to three months.\n\n\u201cTo provide for the State of the Nation and State Address by the President and Governor; and for Related Matters. To include former Heads of the National Assembly in the council of state; and for Related Matters. To provide for the Termination of Tenure of certain Elected officials on Account of change of political party; and for Related Matters. To enhance existing provisions on the formation of political parties.\u201d\n\nRejected Bills\n\nOn the other hand, the National Assembly turned down the Bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide Pension for Presiding Officers of the National Assembly. While 102 lawmakers voted in support, 103 voted against the recommendation which would have made the current Senate President, Lawan and Speaker, Gbajabiamila and their Deputies beneficiaries.\n\nThey also rejected the Bill for an Act to Alter Part I of the Second Schedule to the Constitution to include Value Added Tax (VAT) on the Exclusive Legislative list.\n\nVAT issue has been in contention between the federal and state governments over who should be collecting it and how it should be shared. In all, 209 members voted against it, while only 91 voted in support, thereby taking it out of the purview of only the federal government.\n\nThe lawmakers, sadly killed three bills seeking more inclusion of women in elective positions. The bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide for Special Seat for Women in the National and State Houses of Assembly, had 208 members voting against the amendment with only 81 supporting.\n\nSimilarly, the second bill seeking for Affirmative Action for Women in Political Party Administration was equally rejected by majority of the lawmakers despite appeals by the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nDuring consideration of the bill, PDP lawmakers Bamidele Salam from Osun state and Dachung Bagos from Plateau state, suggested that the 35 per cent affirmative action should be reduced to 15 per cent.\n\nWhile 195 lawmakers agreed with Salam\u2019s amendment, 107 voted against it. Gbajabiamila called for repetition of the process appealing to his colleagues to support the bill, saying women are the ones that come out en masse to vote during elections. However, his appeals were not heeded to and he thereafter vowed to expose those who voted against women bills.\n\nHe said, \u201cFollowing existing statistics it is women that come out en masse to vote. It is the same women who come out in mass to vote for us. You are now here voting against their interest? I am going to publish those who voted against this particular bill.\u201d\n\nThe third bill seeking to provide for a Minimum Percentage for Women in Ministerial or Commissioner Nominees was also rejected by the Lawmakers, despite pleas from Gbajabiamila, the Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu and Chairman Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson for them to support the Bill.\n\nThe Speaker, however amended that 20 per cent should be given to Women for ministerial, commissioner nominees regardless of Nays scream from the lawmakers.\n\nThe House further voted against itself on a bill to provide the procedure for overriding executive veto in respect of money bills. While 284 voted for, 10 voted against. 288 votes that is 4/5 was required to pass the Bill.\n\nThe lawmakers also rejected bill to provide for Diaspora Voting. 240 lawmakers voted against while 59 voted in support.\n\nThe bill to expand immunity to the legislative and Judicial Arms of Government was equally rejected.\n\nEarlier, majority of the lawmakers kicked against move to usher in Dolapo Osinbajo to witness voting on the bills up for consideration in the Constitution Amendment.\n\nGbajabiamila who presided over the session had called on the House Leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa to suspend relevant rules of the House and moved that the VP\u2019s wife should be ushered in to witness the proceedings.\n\nThis generated screams of Nays from lawmakers across party lines. However, the Speaker cautioned his colleagues particularly the PDP lawmakers for kicking against it.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cHon. Chinda and co, the fact that I referred you guys as smaller parties doesn\u2019t mean you should scream no.\u201d\n\nHe, thereafter put the decision to usher in the Vice President\u2019s Wife to voice vote, despite the Nays having it, he gave it to the Ayes and the directed the House Leader, to usher in the Vice President\u2019s wife.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Female MTN Nigeria Employees Accuse Chief Sales & Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi, Of Sexual Harassment, Knock CEO, Toriola",
          "text": "Some female employees of telecommunications company, MTN Nigeria, have accused the company's Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi, of sexual harassment and other gross misconducts.\n\nIn a series of emails and documents sent to MTN Group\u2019s headquarters in South Africa between April 2021 and February 2022, the female employees, who hid their identities and only described themselves as \u2018The Anonymous Whistle Blowers\u2019, accused Adebiyi of being a sexual predator in the habit of using his position in the company to sleep with young female employees.\n\nMTN Nigeria Building\n\nThey also accused him of threatening such women with sacking if they fail to give in to his demands.\n\nThe aggrieved employees also alleged that Adebiyi had been using his position to plant family members and friends in key units of the telecommunications company even when such persons clearly lacked the requisite educational qualification and skills to occupy such roles.\n\nThe whistleblowers also accused the Chief Sales and Distribution Officer of inflating contracts, receiving kickbacks and inventing false sales figures to deceive the company's management and continue to keep his coveted role.\n\nAccording to the employees, Adebiyi, despite his gross misconducts and acts of corruption and sabotage against MTN Group, had the full backing of MTN Nigeria Chief Executive Officer, Karl Toriola, and other top officers in the company.\n\nIn some of the emails sent to Nerisha Singh, General Manager, Forensic Services, of MTN Group, by \u2018The Anonymous Whistle Blowers\u2019 and seen by SaharaReporters, the aggrieved employees said, \u201cWe are writing because the man, Adekunle Adebiyi, who heads sales, is a dangerous threat to your company. We wish men like Adekunle Adebiyi will not destroy MTN Nigeria. You left a monster and sexual predator to continue in office but after one year, we can no longer be silenced by his continued intimidation.\n\n\u201cMany of us became victims of his boastful abuses and direct punishments. Three persons resigned in S&D through his intimidations and threats. Kumar Abubakar, a resourceful Senior Manager, was fired by him and Amina, his GM in the North, on trumped-up charges because Kumar knows all their fake and forged gross connections, numbers and sales figures. They know he would expose them to forensics.\n\n\u201cSales conferences are always his grounds for his sexual escapades where he uses his front and power to lure young innocent MTNNers levels 1, 2, 3, vulnerable girls into sex.\n\n\u201cYour sexual harassment policy is not protecting levels 1, 2 or 3 or young girls. They are victims of Adekunle Adebiyi\u2019s sexual harassment. They can't talk or report him because they will lose their jobs. We have many cases reported to close friends instead of HR because they don't trust HR.\n\n\u201cHis bribery and corruption with NIMC Nigeria, collecting money from vendors through his fronts and flooding MTN Nigeria with his family and friends as SIM registration agents have continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdekunle is a bad egg. His corruption is beyond imagination. One of our anonymous members shared a message from him to a finance staff member compelling them to pre-pay a vendor for a big contract, so he can collect his bribes upfront.\n\n\"He gives contracts to vendors abroad at higher costs because of money they want to collect as bribes. Procurement staff and Finance team know this but could not report until some of them joined this\n\n\"whistleblower\" group. Yet they are still afraid because our jobs are threatened by these men who work for Adekunle.\n\n\u201cCheck the employments of his many relatives, especially of Ekundayo Fatoki, Customer Acquisition Manager. He failed interviews but Adekunle and his cohorts brought him in re-conducting the interviews two times or more times. The two ladies he sexually harassed are now afraid, too, to come with proof because our jobs are not safe. We are scared and our lives are at risk. Adekunle and his cohorts are powerful and can exterminate us if they have to.\n\n\u201cTwo board of directors are his men.

          "text": "Some female employees of telecommunications company, MTN Nigeria, have accused the company's Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi, of sexual harassment and other gross misconducts.\n\nIn a series of emails and documents sent to MTN Group\u2019s headquarters in South Africa between April 2021 and February 2022, the female employees, who hid their identities and only described themselves as \u2018The Anonymous Whistle Blowers\u2019, accused Adebiyi of being a sexual predator in the habit of using his position in the company to sleep with young female employees.\n\nMTN Nigeria Building\n\nThey also accused him of threatening such women with sacking if they fail to give in to his demands.\n\nThe aggrieved employees also alleged that Adebiyi had been using his position to plant family members and friends in key units of the telecommunications company even when such persons clearly lacked the requisite educational qualification and skills to occupy such roles.\n\nThe whistleblowers also accused the Chief Sales and Distribution Officer of inflating contracts, receiving kickbacks and inventing false sales figures to deceive the company's management and continue to keep his coveted role.\n\nAccording to the employees, Adebiyi, despite his gross misconducts and acts of corruption and sabotage against MTN Group, had the full backing of MTN Nigeria Chief Executive Officer, Karl Toriola, and other top officers in the company.\n\nIn some of the emails sent to Nerisha Singh, General Manager, Forensic Services, of MTN Group, by \u2018The Anonymous Whistle Blowers\u2019 and seen by SaharaReporters, the aggrieved employees said, \u201cWe are writing because the man, Adekunle Adebiyi, who heads sales, is a dangerous threat to your company. We wish men like Adekunle Adebiyi will not destroy MTN Nigeria. You left a monster and sexual predator to continue in office but after one year, we can no longer be silenced by his continued intimidation.\n\n\u201cMany of us became victims of his boastful abuses and direct punishments. Three persons resigned in S&D through his intimidations and threats. Kumar Abubakar, a resourceful Senior Manager, was fired by him and Amina, his GM in the North, on trumped-up charges because Kumar knows all their fake and forged gross connections, numbers and sales figures. They know he would expose them to forensics.\n\n\u201cSales conferences are always his grounds for his sexual escapades where he uses his front and power to lure young innocent MTNNers levels 1, 2, 3, vulnerable girls into sex.\n\n\u201cYour sexual harassment policy is not protecting levels 1, 2 or 3 or young girls. They are victims of Adekunle Adebiyi\u2019s sexual harassment. They can't talk or report him because they will lose their jobs. We have many cases reported to close friends instead of HR because they don't trust HR.\n\n\u201cHis bribery and corruption with NIMC Nigeria, collecting money from vendors through his fronts and flooding MTN Nigeria with his family and friends as SIM registration agents have continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdekunle is a bad egg. His corruption is beyond imagination. One of our anonymous members shared a message from him to a finance staff member compelling them to pre-pay a vendor for a big contract, so he can collect his bribes upfront.\n\n\"He gives contracts to vendors abroad at higher costs because of money they want to collect as bribes. Procurement staff and Finance team know this but could not report until some of them joined this\n\n\"whistleblower\" group. Yet they are still afraid because our jobs are threatened by these men who work for Adekunle.\n\n\u201cCheck the employments of his many relatives, especially of Ekundayo Fatoki, Customer Acquisition Manager. He failed interviews but Adekunle and his cohorts brought him in re-conducting the interviews two times or more times. The two ladies he sexually harassed are now afraid, too, to come with proof because our jobs are not safe. We are scared and our lives are at risk. Adekunle and his cohorts are powerful and can exterminate us if they have to.\n\n\u201cTwo board of directors are his men. Cyril Ilok, head of forensics, is his womanising and drinking partner, who will never allow all the petitions from the staff to go through investigations.\n\n\u201cHe takes bribes from vendors and settles his \"boys and girls\" in all the units he carries out fraudulent activities, including procurement. Four years ago he fired Daniel and Bukola because they know his secrets about fraudulent activities in all the procurements deals for MTN.\n\n\u201cThe people had videos of when his fronts collected the money as bribes unfortunately, they were threatened and fired.

          "title": "Amid Russian invasion of Ukraine, social media accounts were hacked to share Russian propaganda",
          "text": "On February 27, Nigerian web designer, Olalekan Owonikoko was away from Twitter when a friend shared a screenshot of a tweet from his account, knowing fully well that it wasn\u2019t the kind of post Owonikoko would make. After seeing the screenshot, Owonikoko was confused as he hadn\u2019t made the post.\n\nA few days before this, the Russian government launched an offensive on a neighbouring eastern European country, Ukraine. But we are an internet world, so the war has also gone to social media, with each side trying to control the narrative online. A huge propaganda war is ongoing and social media has been crucial for sharing updates, and misinformation, about the war. TikTok was used to share updates on the Russian army\u2019s march to Ukraine, while on the other side of the war, a 27-year-old Russian TikTokker Niki Proshin live-streamed an anti-war protest in Russia. Photo sharing app, Instagram, is being used by independent journalist Ilya Varlamov to record videos and take pictures that represent his version of Russia\u2019s military action. In a matter of days, Ukrainian influencer Anna Prytula moved away from her lifestyle posts to show footage of missiles attacking her country on Instagram. Social media has also seen the rise of \u201cwar pages\u201d\u2014Instagram meme pages that promise to share updates on the Ukraine conflict but are fake pages hoping to get money from advertisements.\n\nOn February 26, social media accounts linked to Buffer, the social media scheduling tool, were hacked to spread support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine under the hashtag #SupportRussia. \u201cIt was clearly not the kind of content I would share,\u201d Owonikoko said. \u201cMy friend knew this and wanted to be sure I hadn\u2019t shared such a thing. I took a minute to be sure I hadn\u2019t engaged with any content like that and accidentally shared it. It was clear my account had been hacked,\u201d said Owonikoko, who noted that though his Twitter account is set up on Buffer, he rarely uses the app. Like most propaganda and disinformation campaigns, the accounts shared the same tweet, with the same social media asset, and at the same time.\n\nA cross-section of accounts that posted the propaganda post on Twitter. Source: Reddit\n\nBuffer released a statement on February 26, where it acknowledged that Buffer accounts had been hacked to share unauthorised posts that support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Buffer revealed that 1,552 accounts were affected, while 618 accounts posted 766 unauthorised content across Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Buffer revealed in its statement that none of the 1,552 affected accounts had 2-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and attributed the hack to reused passwords.\n\nTwitter user, @Downtownrob, revealed that he doesn\u2019t have two-factor authentication (2FA) on his account, and uses a virtual assistant, Fancy Hands, which publishes WordPress articles for him via Buffer.\n\nTechCabal\u2019s Twitter account, which is linked to Buffer, was compromised and also shared the propaganda tweet. The newsroom was alerted to the development; we took the tweet down and shared a statement on Twitter clarifying the situation.\n\nThis is not the first time Russia has tried to shape international opinion about its invasion of Ukraine. Back in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea Peninsula, a network of trolls, bots, and spam accounts focused on denying military presence in the Peninsula. However, Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign goes beyond Ukraine; they affect users everywhere. For instance, a Facebook threat report released last May revealed that Russia\u2019s biggest disinformation campaigns targeted Ghana, the US, and Mexico.\n\nA few days ago, Facebook disabled a misinformation network of about 40 accounts that were pushing fake news about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Twitter said it has been removing disinformation networks linked to the Ukraine conflict. With a no-holds-barred propaganda and disinformation campaign spreading on social media, it is imperative that users take digital security measures more seriously and are careful about information they consume on social media, especially at this time.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "What happens to your assets when you die? Do they go to your family or will they become unclaimed assets?\n\nGlobal unclaimed assets are running into billions of dollars. Currently, in the US, unclaimed cash and benefits are worth about $58 billion. In the UK, in 2019, The Telegraph reported \u00a3200 billion in lost assets. In South Africa, unclaimed assets are valued at R45 billion (~$3 billion). Chainalysis also estimates that about a fifth of all bitcoin mined to date \u2014 somewhere between 2.78 and 3.79 million\u2014are unclaimed.\n\nEvery nation in the world has its own reservoir of unclaimed assets.\n\nThese unclaimed properties and assets come from a variety of sources, including abandoned bank accounts and stock holdings, unclaimed life insurance payouts, forgotten pension benefits, forgotten landed properties, and more.\n\nRecently, in Canada, Yomi Osamiluyi, a software engineer, realised that his assets were placed in several investments and wished he could track them all under one platform which his loved ones would have access to claim in the event of his death and in the absence of a will. After doing some digging, he discovered that there was no simple means or tool to integrate his assets.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSimilarly, last year in Nigeria, Oluyomi Ojo, a Lagos-based tech entrepreneur, had just caught the bug of buying shitcoins\u2014dogecoin had just crossed a massive milestone and was trending on social media\u2014and downloaded Binance to buy some units of dogecoin. But, after buying it, the question he asked himself was, who gets the coin should anything happen to him? How would his family claim it?\n\nAs someone who\u2019s built and run businesses, instead of dwelling too long on the question, Ojo began to think of how to solve the problem. There were many ideas, but that of a tool that puts all one\u2019s assets in one place for easy tracking and management was top of the list. So, to test the validity of his idea, he tweeted about it, and within an hour, thousands of people engaged with likes, questions, interest, and more suggestions on how to finesse the idea.\n\nStartup idea. Investment inheritance tech. Somewhere you can connect all your cryptocurrencies & investments with passwords and details. If you pass on or anything happens to you. It shares full access with your next of kin.\n\n\n\nI feel platforms are inheriting unclaimed investments \u2014 Oluyomi Ojo (@OluyomiOjo) January 29, 2021\n\nEven though the idea to build a solution to the problem didn\u2019t come from Twitter, the conviction that it could be a product people would pay to use came from the social media platform. After the tweet went viral, it became apparent that there was a real problem to solve and a market to build for. So, that same day Ojo reached out to Osamiluyi, who was a founding member and CTO at Printivo, a Lagos-based printing company Ojo co-founded, for 4 years before relocating to Canada.\n\nDue to his initial interest, the idea resonated with Osamiluyi, and the duo started working on the product that would be called Cova.\n\n\u201cI reached out to Yomi, and within 24 hours, the first waitlist\u2019s landing page was ready and over 700 people dropped their email addresses,\u201d said Ojo, CEO at Cova.\n\nOluyomi Ojo, cofounder/CEO at Cova\n\nCova app was finally launched into the market December last year.\n\nHow Cova works\n\nCova is built to organise users\u2019 assets in one place and transfer ownership to users\u2019 listed beneficiaries in the event of their death. So, when a user opens an account on the platform and completes the required know-your-customer (KYC) process, they can then go on to file in their assets, create a beneficiary and third-party trustee, and their \u201ccheck-in time\u201d\u2014meaning the threshold of inactiveness that must be exceeded before the platform transfers ownership to the user\u2019s beneficiaries.\n\nCova provides layers of beneficiaries. For now, users can only add one direct beneficiary, which is the first layer, and then a trustee\u2014someone who will take charge if the beneficiary is unavailable to claim the asset.\n\nThe platform notifies the beneficiary when a user fails to check in after they\u2019ve passed their check-in waiting time. The same thing happens to the beneficiary when they fail to claim the asset and the trustee gets it.\n\n\u201cCova is like a single source of truth for everything you own. It gives you the power to aggregate, manage and track everything, even while you\u2019re alive, and also helps your people discover and claim your assets when you\u2019re gone,\u201d said Ojo, CEO at Cova, who is also co-founder at Hallo Creative, a Lagos-based advertising company.\n\nCova supports two types of assets: digital assets like bank accounts and crypto wallets; and physical assets like landed property. The digital assets are called connected or sync assets that can be pulled in from third-party systems holding the assets through API. For instance, users can sync their Cova profile with their local and international bank accounts, savings apps like Piggyvest and Kuda, investment apps like Bamboo and Robinhood, and crypto wallets like Binance, Trust Wallets, and BuyCoins.\n\nPhysical assets, on the other hand, are manually added. Users would have to add the details of the assets themselves\u2014location, certificate of ownership, and other required documents\u2014and their value.\n\n\u201cOur users are saying, \u2018I\u2019m alive now: what else can I do with this app?\u2019 We realise that people are a lot more focused on asset tracking, and we must be able to let them see what their assets are worth in real time,\u201d said Ojo. \u201cSome of them don\u2019t even go to their holding platform anymore; they just come to Cova, see what their assets are now worth, and are good.\u201d\n\nYomi Osamiluyi, cofounder and CTO at Cova\n\nSecurity is top priority\n\nIn this type of business, securing users\u2019 data is at the heart of the day-to-day. According to Osamiluyi, the company CTO and a security engineering , Cova employs encryption strategies to secure users\u2019 sensitive data. \u201cWe have also built a multi-factor authentication feature into the system so that users can add layers of security to their account.\u201d He also said that they will continue to look for better ways to secure users\u2019 data.\n\nThe company operates a subscription-based model and charges $4.99 per month and $59.99 per year. Ojo said, since launch, Cova\u2019s customers have gone into the thousands. What\u2019s also interesting is that the startup is positioned as a global company rather than the usual African company. It\u2019s operational anywhere in the world even though its user base is currently concentrated in the US, Canada, and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUsers can sync their physical assets from anywhere in the world, but for bank accounts, only users in Nigeria, US, and Canada can do that, for now.\u201d\n\nGlobally, this is a nascent industry that can either be placed in insurance tech, inheritance tech, security tech, and even fintech. But for Ojo, it\u2019s better called wealthtech.\n\nAt the moment, Cova is the only business building at this scale in Africa. But since the company is positioned as a global enterprise, there are global direct and indirect competitors like Everplans, which helps in securing important documents.\n\nBoth Ojo and Osamiluyi believe that this new industry that Cova plays in will be big in the coming years as the proliferation of digital assets like crypto, NFTs, and stocks continue to expand.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside HUB2's digital stack for insurance providers in francophone Africa",
          "text": "Compared to other developed and emerging markets, insurance in Africa remains a marginal product. As of 2018, total insurance penetration in Africa stood at just 3% in a population of 1.2 billion people, per a McKinsey report. And going by data from the African Insurance Organisation, that figure dropped to 2.78% a year later, far below the global average of 7.23%.\n\nBut like most under-tapped sectors, there\u2019s a strong reason to believe that the rapid expansion of digital and mobile services in Africa could change the face of insurance on the continent. Already, a small but growing number of startups\u2014such as Nigeria-based Casava and Kenya\u2019s Lami\u2014have sprung up to broaden insurance coverage in some parts of Africa.\n\nWhile the aforementioned players directly offer insurance products to the mass market through digital channels, some other startups operate as enablers for incumbents. One such is C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire-based HUB2, an insurance-focused fintech company founded in 2018 by Ashley Gauzere.\n\nHUB2 provides a suite of infrastructure services\u2014including payment collections via mobile money, bank cards, and POS agents, chatbots deployment as well as logistics and delivery\u2014that help traditional insurance giants reach last-mile consumers in several francophone African countries.\n\nThe company currently operates in 9 French-speaking countries (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Mali, Guinea, Niger Republic, DRC, and Gabon) across West and Central African regions. It also serves at least 10 of the biggest insurance providers in the region (including Allianz, Leadway, Ascoma, OLEA, Activa, etc.).\n\nDespite its success so far, HUB2, which works out of the Village by CA R\u00e9union, a French department in the Indian Ocean, was initially launched to serve the e-commerce space in francophone Africa, not insurance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFrom telecom to tech: founding HUB2\n\nBefore founding HUB2, Gauzere ran a management consulting company based in Mauritius that advised telecom operators across western Africa. Prior to that, he worked at French network operator Orange in Africa and the Middle East, developing broadband infrastructure in several countries.\n\nDuring his time at Orange, while deploying 3G and 4G networks as well as fibre infrastructure, Gauzere would always pay attention to the e-commerce sector and noticed that apart from internet connectivity, the main infrastructure needs that were holding back the sector were logistics and financial services.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, I decided to work on a payments aggregator for e-commerce services in francophone Africa which we launched a year later in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\u201d the CEO recalled in an interview with TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAt the end of 2019, we got our first customer from the insurance sector and after recording significant success with that account, saw that there was a huge opportunity there and decided to build a complete and dedicated technical stack to address the challenges that players in the insurance sector face.\u201d\n\nAshley Gauzere, founder and CEO of HUB2.\n\nA digital backbone for insurance services\n\nHUB2 is primarily a payments aggregator enabling interoperability between mobile money wallets within the same country. With regard to payment integrations, it is connected to at least 28 local and national major mobile money operators, including Orange Money, MTN, Moov Moov, Mobicash, Wizall, Yup, etc. through direct or indirect connections (via other aggregators).\n\nThe startup\u2019s main customers come from the insurance sector. Through its infrastructure, insurance companies, brokers, and retailers can carry out transactions, including premium payments and claims, via mobile money and bank cards. The startup also has partnerships with major POS networks, including InTouch, through which end customers can access, purchase and renew insurance covers provided by its clients.\n\nAccording to Gauzere, HUB2 currently processes up to $10 million per month in payments. Meanwhile, insurance providers on its platform can sell their products via 30,000 agents across its markets, with 5,000 of those in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire alone, which accounts for almost 30% of the insurance market in francophone West Africa.\n\nAs part of non-fintech services, HUB2 builds and deploys conversational chatbots to help insurance companies automate their customer engagement efforts, and has partnerships with Glovo and Jumia, to use their logistics services for the delivery of physical insurance certificates to customers.\n\n\u201cI like to refer to HUB2 as a \u2018hybrid\u2019 or \u2018FinInsurTech\u2019 company because we offer financial and non-transactional services, mostly to insurance companies,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cThe vision is to enhance their traditional systems and make them more reactive and operate in real-time.\u201d\n\nGauzere believes HUB2\u2019s success so far has been down to a \u201creal product-market fit\u201d of its full-stack solution.\n\nFrancophone West Africa has an extremely low insurance penetration rate of 1.2%, according to the McKinsey report. Due to the low rate of insurance in the region of nearly 300 million people (excluding Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), major opportunities exist for this low penetration to grow substantially.\n\nIn addition, digital financial services, particularly mobile money (MoMo) and agency banking are widely used by the public in francophone African markets. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, one of the region\u2019s largest MoMo markets, 75% of the population own a mobile money account, compared to 20% who own bank accounts.\n\nMany traditional insurers are also realising the need to modernise and scale up their technological setup, especially in the wake of the pandemic-induced boom in the demand for remote services.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s no better way to reach the mass market than through mobile systems,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cAn additional advantage is that our digital infrastructure is on-demand, so there is no recurring cost for companies. The comprehensive service is available at a very marginal cost for companies to increase their operation and efficiency.\u201d\n\nDespite this, getting insurance companies to buy into using digital solutions hasn\u2019t been easy. The insurance sector in francophone Africa is a largely traditional one where paper certificates are common and delivered three to four weeks after subscription.\n\n\u201cThe adoption curve was a very huge issue early on,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cYou talk to insurance companies about using mobile money and technology and they\u2019re like, \u2018Okay, so from which planet are you from?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe apathy for tech-enabled services is just one of many challenges the HUB2 team has had to deal with while building and scaling the platform in francophone Africa.\n\nThough HUB2 has secured a total of $1.8 million in total external funding since its launch, Gauzere reveals attracting funding has been difficult. He blames this on the fact that the insurance sector is not one where investors can get the most margin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still the early days,\u201d he said, adding that finding the \u201cright technical talent\u201d to help scale the 4-year-old startup has also been challenging.\n\nRegulation: an enabler and a bottleneck\n\nThe Conf\u00e9rence Interafricaine des March\u00e9s d\u2019Assurances (CIMA)\u2014an insurance oversight body covering 14, mostly francophone, countries with harmonised insurance laws and regulations\u2014was established in 1992 to improve the insurance process across the region.\n\nBy creating a single regulatory structure, the CIMA has been beneficial in promoting stability in the industry. It\u2019s also helped platforms like HUB2 scale relatively easily across the region but Gauzere noted that the one-size-fits-all policy for a diverse array of markets may lead to complexities in some member states.\n\n\u201cThe CIMA zone may enable easier movement across countries but sometimes, the inflexible regulatory demands and rules may hinder innovation in specific member countries,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing forward, Gauzere reveals HUB2 has several agreements with other mobile money providers and agent networks that\u2019ll help expand its market reach to 50,000 agents by 2022 end. However, the logistics side is harder to scale as the startup has to find a reliable partner in each country.\n\nHUB2 has also been contracted by two insurers in the French-speaking region to roll out fully digital micro-insurance products in some of its markets, according to the CEO.\n\n\u201cWe believe that digital micro-insurance, linked with the right network for distribution, has the same potential as mobile banking,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cIncreasing insurance penetration in the region will largely be achieved through digital micro-insurance.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "On Tuesday, many African entrepreneurs and tech startup founders took to twitter to express their displeasure of how Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, blocked their accounts without prior communication.\n\nWhile some startups found out on Monday night that they\u2019ve been shut out of the platform and thought it was a glitch, choosing to wait it out till Tuesday, others found out on Tuesday when people started tweeting about it.\n\nMercury dey block everybody account. Wetin sup? \u2014 Polysaccharide Patriach (@bigbrutha_) March 1, 2022\n\nBank Mercury blocked a bunch of African tech startups\u2026 we have work to do. @immad please fix for the founders who are affected. \u2014 Benjamin Fernandes \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddff (@Benji_Fernandes) March 1, 2022\n\nThis is not a good look. I have a list of over 20+ African startups whose bank accounts were mass-blocked at around the same time by @BankMercury yesterday. I love Mercury a lot but they can\u2019t just do this to an entire continent. It is not right & we need to all speak up. https://t.co/vr21Pd9nq4 \u2014 Moe is mourning her crocs (@Mochievous) March 1, 2022\n\nMercury restricted a large number of African startups\u2019 bank accounts enmasse due to \u201cunusual activity\u201d.\n\n\n\nLike that number of accounts. At the same time.\n\n\n\nWild. \u2014 10X Tech Bro (@OdunEweniyi) March 1, 2022\n\nLater on Tuesday, Mercury responded by sending out an email that vaguely indicated that the accounts were blocked due to some compliance issues.\n\nEmail sent to affected startups after blocking their accounts\n\nIn the later hours of the same day, after more bigwigs African founders have directly tweeted at Immad Akhund, cofounder and CEO of the startup, he sent out a personal email to the affected startups. In the email, he apologised and hinted that the restriction of the accounts was as a result of Mercury\u2019s partner bank noticing an \u201cunusual activity and asked us to lock and investigate a large set of accounts with linked activity.\u201d\n\nImmad Akhund\u2019s email to affected startups\n\nThis measure, however, has thrown a couple of businesses into chaos as they can\u2019t fulfill international transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no concrete reason why we\u2019re blocked. The last payment we made via the account was our Delaware Franchise Tax and we did that last week,\u201d said Charles Dairo, co-founder and CEO of Beezop, one of many startups whose accounts were temporarily blocked.\n\nWhile Beezop was lucky to have sent out their own tax payment prior to the event, some founders have not yet filed theirs, and failure to do so may lead to them being fined as the deadline was on Tuesday. Other founders who used the bank for more frequent transactions complained that the pending transactions they sent out are getting bounced and this is affecting their fiscal operation.\n\nwe have two vendors and several payments that we can't fulfil and one can imagine the rest of stories https://t.co/9N7mfOCaGC \u2014 ET (@ebottabi) March 1, 2022\n\nThe implications of this incident are bad for the affected startups but it has also put a terrible dent on Mercury\u2019s reputation on the continent.\n\nMany African founders and ecosystem players have come out to suggest a boycott and others have suggested a home-built alternative that only either serves African founders or black owned businesses.\n\nA black community-owned global digital bank for black-owned startups, fund managers, businesses, creators, etc. is needed. \u2014 Dayo Koleowo (@NateKorl) March 1, 2022\n\nNotably, even a home-built alternative will need partnership with foreign banks to fly. Digital business bank account providers like Mercury need to collaborate with, oftentimes, traditional banks who can choose to pull the plug anytime. Like in this case.\n\nThis situation is similar to instances on Wise, Paypal, and other international cross-border payment networks that often lock individual African users out of their accounts. Could this be the beginning of an extension to African businesses?\n\nTechCabal reached out to Mercury for comments and their response was similar to what the CEO had already said.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that one of our backend banks has suspended the accounts of a number of Mercury customers in Africa. While the bank was acting in compliance with its internal procedures, the suspension has adversely affected some customers and we are working with the bank to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. We\u2019re reaching out to the customers impacted directly, and apologize for the disruption this event has caused,\u201d Mercury said in the email to TechCabal.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the questions that are yet to be answered are: what unusual activity occurred, who is the partner that pulled the plug, why did this affect only African startups, and why didn\u2019t Mercury notify its users before restricting their accounts after it got a nudge from its partner?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurial stories are told using various narratives, which all have two things in common: It\u2019s not a walk in the park. It\u2019s not for the faint-hearted. While some founders have a clearly defined path that segues into a completely different trajectory, bearing with it the tide for a business idea, others stumble upon entrepreneurship.\n\nFor Oluwatobi Odukoya, CDcare Co-founder/CEO, and Ayodeji Farohun, Co-founder/COO, the journey to building CDcare was a combination of the influence of a father who ran a local credit platform in their community, an academic environment that fostered entrepreneurial spirits, and his knack for solving problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDcare Co-founders(L-R): Oluwatobi Odukoya (CEO), and Ayodeji Farohun (COO)\n\nCDcare is an online marketplace that lets users shop for gadgets, home appliances, and electronics at regular market prices with the option of paying in instalments at no interest rate. It all began when Odukoya was a 100 level chemical engineering student at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Il\u00e9-if\u1eb9\u0300, Southwest Nigeria.\n\nThe seed for the idea was planted as he watched his mom save up for months to get him his first laptop. He decided to start a Loan-a-Laptop scheme in the university\u2019s environs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy mom saved for roughly over eight months to get me my first laptop. In school, I saw that this was something most parents did too. And having assisted my father while he managed a microfinance society back home, I sort of had early exposure to credit systems. So I started with laptops. I\u2019d help students buy laptops, and they\u2019d pay little by little.\u201d\n\nBut his entrepreneurial sprint began a year after getting into the university. He pioneered a small business that helped fellow students secure important files even after formatting their computers.\n\n\u201cBefore getting into OAU, I had never sat down in front of a computer. Upon coming in contact with one, I started learning to fix small hardware faults. This was the discovery of my knack for solving problems. In year one, I discovered that final year students lost their projects to small viruses. So I decided to research and come up with a way to fix this. With the help of my brother\u2019s Internet connection and computer, I found a way to format computers without people losing their files.\u201d\n\nOdukoya shares that the OAU environment encouraged entrepreneurial pursuits, which significantly contributed to the growth of the computer repair business.\n\n\u201cOAU has a very supportive community. There were students in school who survived selling pure water and groundnuts to fellow students. When you start a business, everyone would suddenly begin to patronise you rather than an outsider.\u201d\n\nGraduates who left the boundaries of Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0301 for the job market recommended him to the companies they worked in to fix their computers. They opened a Lagos branch to cut out the challenge of transporting these computers from Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300 to Lagos.\n\n\u201cAs my business grew, I started training other indigenes so that I could focus on school. Recently, I sold off the OAU arm of that business. The Lagos arm is still known as Computer Doctor today. Our clients include top fintechs like Paystack and Flutterwave. We were able to land these clients thanks to people who patronised us in school and then recommended us to their companies after graduating,\u201d he adds.\n\nRunning CDcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatobi Odukoya, CDcare Co-founder/CEO\n\nAlthough the Loan-a-Laptop scheme started as a stint at school, it was already a full-fledged business affiliated with his Computer Doctor operations by 2013, around Odukoya\u2019s final year in the university. Landing a partnership with a big distribution company was his big break.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had been going about my regular computer business dealings with the Loan a Laptop scheme when I met Adedeji, who currently is my co-founder. We were classmates and became friends after he purchased a laptop from me, and we began co-running the scheme. A few years into this, we got a partnership with Fouani. We\u2019d been dealing with them for the scheme because we delved into electronics and appliances and had gotten enough units to be partners. So we decided to start CDcare.\u201d\n\nBecause he couldn\u2019t afford a developer, Odukoya had to learn to use Flutter, a software design kit with ready-to-use codes and tools to build websites and apps developed by Google.\n\nFouani Nigeria Ltd is a subsidiary of Fouani Group, licensed distributors of electronic appliances made by LG and Hisense. This partnership meant Odukoya and his partner could make bulk purchases at a discount. Today, they partner with other companies, including Apple Nigeria, Scanfrost, Vitafoam, and Haier Thermocool.\n\nHow CDcare works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDcare homepage\n\nAlthough not as mainstream today, given the presence of established financial institutions, the concept of community-based savings schemes in Nigeria dates back to the country\u2019s pre-colonial era. Individuals came together to make daily/weekly monetary contributions with a reputable person in charge of recording the funds and providing credit financing when needed.\n\nOdukoya emphasises that CDcare is not a fintech platform but rather an online marketplace that allows people to buy goods by paying in small chunks for up to 12 months and receive the goods after the first half has been paid at zero interest rate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple; we offer a \u2018pay small small for gadgets and appliances with zero interest\u2019, and at normal market price. Our users collect their items in the middle of the instalment period. Depending on your income frequency, we have between two months and 12-month instalments. CDcare can be seen as a better way to save up and buy something. And because we have our marketplace, it is easy to ensure quality.\u201d\n\nFor context, a user gets their item shipped after the first instalment for a two-month plan. As a perk for consistent users, the platform also offers a feature where buyers can get their items shipped and delivered after the first payment for a three-month plan. This added feature is called CDcare3. The CDcare app is available on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, and also as a web application.\n\nIt will not be out of place to wonder why CDcare runs a zero-interest and normal market price model, unlike other Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) schemes with varying business models like QuickBucks, Carbon Zero, Specta, AltMall, etc., but Odukoya reveals the reasoning behind this.\n\n\u201cLoan companies in Nigeria are missing out on a nuance in the Nigerian populace. It might not be a big factor, but it is something. Nigeria has a lot of Muslims, and interest schemes are like a taboo in Islam.\n\n\u201cSo, one reason we have a lot of northern customers is the zero interest rate. Another factor is the African aversion to credit. Owing is seen as a shameful thing in most Nigerian communities, so this model makes the buyers feel like they\u2019re saving to buy rather than the feeling of taking a loan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, CDcare had sold over 15,000 products to over 7,000 people across Nigeria. For many of its customers, the question is always how does the platform make money given the model it operates.\n\n\u201cA lot of people wonder how we make money. We\u2019re leveraging the fact that most people would rather save up and buy at a normal market price than take out a loan and pay interest. Also, our partnerships with companies help us control the quality of goods, which boosts our user base. We get goods at very discounted prices, so we can sell at a reasonable price without tampering with the market price,\u201d Odukoya says.\n\nHe also adds that aside from an angel investment of $10,000, they have neither started an investment round nor received any financing from external sources. Although, he acknowledges that investments will speed up their current 20% month-on-month growth.\n\n\u201cWe are open to investments because there are a lot of plans in place that only adequate funding can help us carry out. We are currently speaking to investors and trying to raise funds. However, I believe that the amount of time spent trying to convince an investor can be spent sitting down to convince a customer. The success we have achieved so far is due to a relentless and dedicated team and word-of-mouth from our customers. Our focus right now is on getting more customers.\u201d\n\nChallenges so far\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the online retail business, the issue of trust on the part of both sellers and buyers cannot be over flogged. This was a significant challenge when CDcare started, and Odukoya believes that trust is a two-way thing in eCommerce.\n\n\u201cWhen we started, getting people to trust us was quite a challenge, and to solve this, we started posting products like kettles and other cheap items after users purchased them, and it got to them as they ordered, they would then come back to buy products like MacBooks, deep freezers, and more expensive gadgets.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, there are times that we have had to go to people\u2019s homes to retrieve products due to defaults in payments. We also issue a loan receipt that signifies payment deficit when the items are sent at the middle of their payment plan.\u201d\n\nHe also shares that solving the logistics was an issue, and at some point, all the company\u2019s profit was going into shipping products. They have solved this by partnering with logistics companies and charging delivery fees on goods.\n\nA familiar saying among Nigerians goes thus: problem no dey finish. This can be loosely translated as \u2018tough times are an inevitable part of life.\u2019 Odukoya shares that there have been challenges at several phases in CDcare\u2019s life, challenges he believes are bound to come up as the business grows.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, it was the issue of building the app as we couldn\u2019t afford to pay a developer; I leant Flutter, and we solved that. Then there were some payment issues, which a partnership with Flutterwave helped us sort out. And as we expand, it is expected that challenges like the speed of our response time, managing logistics, and many more, most unforeseen. But as we get to these points, we will figure out a way to sort them out.\u201d\n\nLooking at the future; growth plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction is to startups what wind is to ship sails. It is one of the most vital phases in a startup\u2019s life cycle, and for Odukoya and his team, one near growth plan is product expansion, with the closest being vehicles and home purchases.\n\n\u201cBy 2022, we intend to start selling cars on CDcare, and I would like to put it out that we would love to partner with brands like Innoson Motors and Toyota to make this happen. Most Nigerians settle for Tokunbo because there\u2019s really no way to \u2018buy and pay small small\u2019 for cars. We also want to partner with real estate companies such that you can start making payments for a house at say age 25 and save up with us to own it at, say, 35.\u201d\n\nFor geographical expansion, he shares that a foray to other African countries is in sight, and advancement into Ghana is in the works. However, the big picture is getting the CDcare marketplace to the doorstep of the average African, online and offline.\n\n\u201cOur big vision is getting CDcare to a point where that mechanic on the road can get a small Nokia phone from us, that welder can get a small generator to make his work easier, and the mom/dad can get a blender to make grinding the tomatoes easier. As we speak, we have begun building the framework for this, and it is being experimented.\u201d\n\n\n\nFun fact: I got my current cell phone on CDcare, and I must say, the service is seamless!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "title": "How logistics startup, Flashbike is using the Fiverr model to provide instant pick-up services",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost everyone you know probably has a delivery hiccup story. Whether it is the dispatch rider refusing to pick up your calls or never arriving with your parcel or the dispatch company reacting very rudely when you call to complain, making that call to use logistics services is always fraught with several challenges.\n\nBut you can\u2019t avoid using these last-mile delivery services. From your Jumia Food deliveries to your CDcare purchases, they\u2019ve become quite integral to our everyday lives. Before now, we mostly used these companies to receive correspondence and large parcels \u2014 like the ones we receive from uncles abroad. But the growth of eCommerce has caused an exponential growth in demand.\n\nAccording to Visa\u2019s eCommerce developments across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) report, the global eCommerce sector is projected to grow to $7 trillion by 2024. South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya are leading the pack in Africa, and with McKinsey\u2019s predictions of a $75 billion African market by 2025, the only place now is up.\n\nHowever, although projections are all good and fine, they do not exactly solve the present-day challenges we mentioned earlier. How do you cut down the wait time between dispatch and delivery? And perhaps \u2014 to round it up \u2014 how do you reduce customer and dispatch company headache stories?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCutting down wait time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early 2021, Babajide Padonu, Kolawole Roberts, and Oluwasegun Aderibigbe met to discuss several things. Padonu had worked under Aderibigbe at a previous company and had struck up a friendship. Roberts met Padonu through Aderibigbe and the boat set sail.\n\nIt started as a joke and perhaps an avenue to vent about frustrations caused by dispatch riders, but soon the idea to form Flashbike went from jokester territory to serious business.\n\nThe idea was simple: create a platform that aggregates dispatch riders, enables tracking, and works as quickly as a ride-hailing business.\n\nIt took seven months to churn out a workable iteration and by November 2021, Flashbike was live on Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nLike so many people, they had experienced their fair share of disappointments with delivery companies.\n\nSpeaking to his own experience, Padonu said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of [sic]. I\u2019ve tried to send parcels and they take a long time to come. Or the rider promises that they are going to come and they don\u2019t come or after they\u2019ve promised, they don\u2019t pick your call anymore after you\u2019ve discussed everything. So, it was just very frustrating.\u201d\n\nIt was Aderibigbe who first came up with the idea of an app, and as discussions continued, issues like funding and what exactly this would solve emerged. So research began and as Padonu told Techpoint Africa on a call, they discovered a huge gap: long wait times in pickup and delivery.\n\nAccording to this article on Benjamindada.com comparing wait time for four delivery startups in Lagos, while delivery usually occurs on the same day, wait time for pickup and delivery varied. For some, it took an hour, for others, it arrived the next day \u2014 based on certain extenuating circumstances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlashbike\u2019s model aggregates dispatch companies to provide a pick-up service with the user given the option to pick whichever is closest to them.\n\nWhat this means is that, say Padonu resides in Lekki and wishes to deliver a dress to his mother in Surulere, he can open the app, set the pickup and delivery location, and he could find a dispatch rider as close as 10 km away with a wait time of between 15 \u2013 20 minutes.\n\nInitially the idea was to create an instant service, but due to a lack of riders, they had to manage expectations.\n\nCarving out a different route\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlashbike Co-founders. Source: Supplied\n\nUnlike most other competitors, Flashbike has chosen a different model. Rather than onboarding riders individually, the company employs more of a B2B model which involves introducing the platform to traditional or small-time dispatch companies with little to no tech incorporated in their business.\n\nSo, think of this as a Fiverr but for dispatch companies.\n\nIn some ways, this serves to mitigate the risk that Flashbike incurs, reducing issues with bike repairs and maintenance, preventing possible direct regulatory hits \u2014 although this is arguable \u2014 and training riders on customer satisfaction.\n\nHowever, they still have to contend with customer satisfaction and Padonu described a scenario where a user waited for several hours before receiving their package. Although the situation was eventually addressed, it involved quite a bit of back and forth.\n\nTo prevent situations like this, Padonu advised that users try other riders on the app. He said occurrences like this are mostly caused by shady riders.\n\nInterestingly, Padonu said the app is free for now, a decision that has helped with onboarding logistics companies.\n\n\u201cIn conversation with people where I tell them, \u2018This is what we have, and we\u2019d love you to come onboard,\u2019 they\u2019ll usually ask questions like, \u2018How much are we paying?\u2019 But when you tell them that it is free they are ready to hop in.\u201d\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t always convert to actual users, he says, as sometimes they might download the app and not use it. A phenomenon that is not entirely uncommon.\n\nDue to the model the company uses, Flashbike doesn\u2019t determine pricing. This is usually determined by the exchange between the customer and the logistics company. An option that is quite attractive for the companies.\n\nAnother attractive feature for these companies is the ability to track riders.\n\n\u201cIf you own a company, you can see whatever your rider has done on your own app. As an owner, you would see how many requests your rider has had for the day, the ones that he fulfilled or not. That was one catch they all liked. Because sometimes, some riders can be shady and go and do their own stuff and you can\u2019t monitor them, unless you have the money to put a tracker on your bike. Putting a tracker on five bikes is expensive.\u201d\n\nThe ordinary user also has the option of live-tracking a rider, an option which is also available to other logistics companies like Kwik Delivery.\n\nAlthough there are plans to eventually include a payment method, the idea is to focus on solving the problem before implementing payment.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen in the past with logistics startups, freebies sometimes come back to haunt them.\n\nPadonu, however, said that they inform companies of their intention to monetise the app as they are onboarded.\n\nMapping out the next phase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom what Padonu told us, there\u2019s quite a lot planned.\n\nApart from implementing payments \u2014 perhaps through subscription by the companies \u2014 Flashbike wants to run ads for the logistics companies. Due to the fact that the company is still mostly in beta, Padonu said features are being added based on demand and workability.\n\nThe team packs a range of experience from running previous companies and in cyber security, system analytics, system engineering, and graphic design.\n\nIntriguingly, Flashbike is in no hurry to raise funds, being currently financed by family and friends. Although Padonu said the company has been approached by investors, they want to double down and work on the app before seeking any type of finance.\n\nCurrently, there are plans to expand beyond Lagos and into Abuja by the second quarter of 2022, Port-harcourt by the third quarter, Ghana by the fourth quarter, and Kenya by the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruck Transit Parks (TTP) limited (Ltd), an innovative traffic management company leveraging technology to help decongest Nigerian ports, celebrated its first anniversary and unveiled its new brand on February 28, 2022.\n\nBolaji Akerele, head of corporate development, TTP Ltd, opened the event, welcomed the attendees, and briefed the audience on the journey so far.\n\nHe said that intensive research was done to solve truck traffic and congestion in and around ports, and technology was sourced as the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Bolaji admitted that the past year had been a work in progress for them and their stakeholders: the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA), Lagos State Government (LSG), truck owners and drivers, transport unions, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said they work in line with the plans of the NPA and LSG.\n\nThe next speaker, Richard Emenim, executive assistant to the managing director (MD) of TTP Ltd, gave an overview of the previous year, emphasising the milestones achieved and challenges faced.\n\nOver one year, TTP Ltd has had 9563 registered users, 592780 processed truck bookings, 83531 registered trucks, and 85 approved park facilities. TTP Ltd has been able to help decongest ports and improve access to ports through its proprietary booking app known as \u00c8t\u00f2.\n\nThey have also reduced the cost of moving cargo to and from the port and improved truck throughput efficiency. The ICT solutions offered by TTP Ltd brings ease to trucking operations.\n\nThere have also been challenges; however, TTP Ltd reiterated its resolve to providing lasting solutions to challenges affecting the smooth running of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong these challenges is ineffective enforcement of the call-up system, extortion of drivers by security operatives, thugs, etc., multiple checkpoints, turning away trucks with valid \u00c8t\u00f2 booking tickets, low daily admission of empty containers into the port, and ticket racketeering.\n\nThe proposed solutions to these challenges were presented, most involving working with the NPA, LSG and other stakeholders.\n\nA short documentary by Jama Onwubuariri, the managing director of TTP, discussed the journey so far for TTP Ltd, its importance, and other plans to expand to other ports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Ayo Duruwaiye, the assistant general manager (AGM) operations, Nigerian port authority (NPA), congratulated TTP Ltd; however, he also said pressing issues require attention. He charged TTP Ltd to listen to what their customers are saying as it is a good way to appraise success.\n\nHe highlighted some of the challenges that still require attention and charged TTP Ltd to perform traffic management analysis concerning the numbers they record at the waterfront.\n\nMr Duruwaiye ended by saying that \u201cwe have moved a little bit, but we are not at the point where we should clink glasses.\u201d He said that the NPA would need TTP Ltd to work on the deliverables.\n\nHonorable Shola Giwa representing the Lagos State Government (LSG), discussed the importance of the collaboration between TTP Ltd, NPA and the LSG. He also called for more attention to the issues facing Tin can island. He said focus should not be only on Apapa port.\n\nHe called on the stakeholders to work together, be orderly patriotic and do things right to get things right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Jama Onwubuariri, MD TTP, spoke on the forward steps for TTP Ltd. These steps include complimentary services, helping drivers optimize, improving communications, and increasing engagement with terminal operators. He said that the number of offloaded cargo matters at the end.\n\nMr Onwubuariri gave more insight on \u00c8t\u00f2, their booking app. With \u00c8t\u00f2, truck drivers can book parking spaces at the Lilypond Pre-gate terminal or any satellite parking spaces affiliated with TTP Ltd. This booking service also affords truck drivers entry into the port as their ticket is scanned for confirmation.\n\nThe unveiling of the new brand logo signifying progression was launched by Mr Jama Owubuariri, Mr Ayo Durowaiye, Mr Shola Giwa, Mr Bolaji Akerele and others.\n\nA tour of the lilypond container terminal was held shortly after the launch with visits to the control room, booking center, and container terminal park, among others.\n\nIn a question and answer session, Mr Onwubuariri highlighted that the tech behind TTP Ltd is a mobility and booking solution. It is relatively homegrown because of the unique traffic problem in Nigeria. He also said that this solution is presently being used for truck traffic management.

It should focus on that area. You are focusing on these social services and amenities at a time when the economy of the nation is depressed and not growing at all.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cSome of the things that happened in the recent past can\u2019t be spoken about publicly. I urge the commission never to allow what happened during the sharing of conditional cash transfer from the Federal Government to happen again.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not happy and are angry with the way the conditional cash transfer and sharing of social and economic amenities were handled. The commission needs to look at that and never allow it to happen again.\u201d\n\nNoting that the visit came at the right time as it was necessary to address the lingering issues troubling Nigerians, Obaseki said: \u201cOur founding fathers thought it wise that, in order to preserve the unity of this country, they needed to create a commission that would complement the policy which ensured that every Nigerian will feel that they are part of the country. This was done so that whatever belongs to the country would be equitably and fairly distributed to all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThank you for keeping the spirit of the constitution alive and trying to enforce the constitution as many people feel marginalised in spite of the effort of the commission. Nigerians feel they are not getting what is due them.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe cake we are trying to share in this country is becoming too small as our focus is to build a bigger cake that will be equitably shared. Everybody should be made to contribute something to the national cake for it to be enough for us to share.\n\n\u201cYou have done well as you go about to implement the first task of your mandate, which is ensuring equitable distribution of positions. In fairness, you have done well in that regard.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Executive Chairman, Federal Character Commission, Dr. Muheeba Dankaka, said the visit is in continuation of her engagements with critical stakeholders in the country, adding: \u201cUpon assumption of office, I made it a matter of policy to consult widely and drink from the wealth of experiences of our leaders of thought like you to guide my actions in the course of my assignment.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Character Commission was established with a primary focus of ensuring a strong, virile and indivisible nation, based on fairness, equity and justice, to promote national unity, foster national loyalty and give every citizen of Nigeria a sense of belonging to the nation, notwithstanding the diversities of ethnic origin, culture, language or religion, which may exist.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Ogbonnaya Okorie had approached the High Court seeking the court to interpret the Constitution if the Governor should not vacate office having defected from his party.\n\nIn a 3 hours judgement delivered by, Justice, Henry Njoku ruled that the suit by the Governorship candidate was lacking in merit adding that it\u2019s against the provision of the Constitution for the Governor to vacate his office for defecting to another political party.\n\nJustice Njoku emphasised that the Constitution cannot be used to achieve an unconstitutional feat and awarded the cost of N500,000 against the plaintiff.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConsidering the submissions of both parties, the Court held that having regard to section 188 (1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended, the defendant (Governor Umahi) has not offended any provision of the Constitution or the Electoral Act in his defection to APC.\n\nThe Court further held that having regard to section 308 of the Constitution, it is even wrong to institute criminal or civil proceedings against the office of the Governor.\n\nReacting to the Judgement, Council to the Respondents, Barr.

          "text": "\n\nBy Emmanuella Anokam\n\nPetrol queues at fuel stations will soon disappear as NNPC said today it has begun a round-the-clock loading of trucks at depots.\n\nThe company said the move will clear current petrol scarcity experienced across the country.\n\nIt added that it has 1.7 billion litres of petrol in stock.\n\nThe NNPC, Group Managing Director, Malam Mele Kyari, made this known to journalists in Abuja on Wednesday shortly after a meeting with the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and Petrol Tanker Drivers (PTD).\n\nOthers present at the meeting were the Depot and Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPMAN) and Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN).\n\nKyari said that the additional fuel would relieve the situation in view of persistent queues which continued at the nation\u2019s capital and other parts of the country with fewer stations dispensing the product.\n\n\u201cCurrently, we have over 1.7 billion litres of PMS in our hands both in marine and on land.\n\n\u201cThis means that we now have the capacity to load out excessively from all depots. We have put in place measures to ensure 24 hours loading in all depots.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure that scarcity created by panic buying will now be freed so that normalcy will return to filling stations.\n\n\u201cTypically in situations like this, people go to the fuel stations and buy in excess of what they need and this is what additional supply will resolve. I am very sure that very soon, we will see relief on this,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari said that neither the Federal Government nor the NNPC had any plan to raise the pump price of petrol.\n\nHe urged marketers to ensure that they sell petrol at the price approved by the government.\n\nHe noted that following the meeting, the stakeholders had agreed that NNPC should carry out necessary sanctions on any found selling petrol above approved price including the refusal to sell PMS to stations or depots.\n\nHe equally noted that it would carry out necessary sanctions allowed by law on any defaulting depot owner to ensure that Nigerians would continue to buy the product at the approved price.\n\nHe, however, apologised for the pains Nigerians were experiencing at fuel stations and appealed to consumers to avoid panic buying and to buy only the quantity they needed at fuel outlets.

          "title": "Senior Lawyer Sues Heritage Bank Over Alleged Account Manipulation",
          "text": "The complaint filed by a Lagos lawyer, Barrister Dada Awosika SAN, against Heritage Bank over alleged account manipulation has been delayed to March 31, 2022, by a Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos State, Nigeria.\n\nMr. Olajide Aleshiloye Williams/Otunba Segun Jawando, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria who practices under the business name and style of D.A. Awosika & Partners and maintains a current account with the bank, claimed that Heritage Bank forced him to open the account in order for the judgment sum arising from certain terms of settlement executed between his clients (Mr. Olajide Aleshiloye Williams/Otunba Segun Jawand\n\nAt all material times, he agreed with the bank to run and operate the said current account in line with good banking standard and employ the best ethical and professional manner consistent with global best practice.\n\nFurther to the aforementioned paragraphs and in line with the consent judgment entered on the 12 January 2016 between the Plaintiff\u2019s client and the Bank, the bank paid a total sum of N250 million into the Plaintiff\u2019s stated account as judgment sum at various times in February, 2016, May 2016 and August 2016 for the benefit of the Plaintiff\u2019s clients who were Claimants in Suit number LD/7313/2014.\n\nSurprisingly, in the narration contained in the statement of account of the Plaintiff, the bank manipulated the narration and discreetly described the payment as fees to the Plaintiff.\n\nAwosika, SAN avers that it was an implied term of the banker-customer relationship between parties herein and of the mandate submitted to the bank by him that the Bank would exercise reasonable skill and care in the running of his account and that at no time will the banking and financial records of the Plaintiff be furnished or made available to a third party except with his consent and/or in a normal execution of a valid and subsisting order of court.\n\nHowever, in breach of the sacred mandate donated to the bank for the running of the Plaintiff\u2019s account, the bank disclosed, furnished and passed over to the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) the Plaintiff\u2019s financial and banking detail and this ultimately led FIRS to issue notice to the Plaintiff to remit unpaid taxes for 2016/2017 (as Company Income Tax and Value Added Tax (VAT)} directing the Plaintiff to pay the sum of N23,274,166.19 being turnover of N258,601,846.53 in custody of the bank.\n\nThe Plaintiff immediately responded to the FIRS letter and debunked the insinuation and misconceptions that the Plaintiff was operating as a limited liability company to pay Income Tax.\n\nThereafter it came as a shock to the Plaintiff that the bank posted POST NO DEBIT on the Plaintiff account without any communication to the Plaintiff in compliance with a directive of FIRS.\n\nUpon protest at the Bank\u2019s premises at Adeola Odeku, Victoria Island on the 6th of February, 2019, the bank informed the Plaintiff that the freezing order on the Plaintiff\u2019s account was directed to be placed by FIRS as a result of banking and financial details submitted to FIRS by the Bank.\n\nThe Plaintiff made further protest to FIRS headquarters in Abuja, which later issued directive to the bank to remove the \u2018Post No Debit\u2019 and any other freezing orders, placed on the Plaintiff\u2019s account since February 4, 2019.\n\nThe bank placed this Post No Debit\u2019 on the Plaintiff\u2019s account without any order of court and also the bank furnished the Plaintiff\u2019s banking and financial records to FIRS without order of court or consent of the Plaintiff.\n\nThe Plaintiff alleged further that he made several transfers and cash deposits into his firm\u2019s account with the bank, when the bank thereafter sent notifications of receipt of this transfers and cash deposits, the Plaintiff discovered that the bank had surreptitiously applied a debit of over N23 million into the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account without notice of such activity to the Plaintiff.\n\nThe Plaintiff further avers that the bank appropriated, converted and utilized the entire credit balance in the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account as well as all transfers and cash deposits made into the said account in purported satisfaction of repayment obligations in regard to a purported phony debt allegedly outstanding and payable to the bank.\n\nOn Wednesday 20 November, 2019, the Plaintiff visited the Defendant\u2019s Ashabi Cole branch, Agidingbi, Ikeja being the nearest branch to the Plaintiff\u2019s office to vehemently protest the fraudulent manipulation of his firm\u2019s account but was informed by the manager on duty that the branch could not help him as there was no complaint resolution mechanism available to resolve the issue in that branch.\n\nHowever, the manager of Ashabi Cole branch of the bank confirmed the debit of over N23Million lumped into the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account and advised that the Plaintiff write the bank detailing his complaint to the bank\u2019s Managing Director for expeditious resolution.\n\nThe Plaintiff avers that the bank sent his firm\u2019s November 2019 statement to him on the 2nd of December 2019 and it came as a shock to the Plaintiff that the bank hid or covertly suppressed the debit of over N23 million in the said Plaintiff\u2019s account.\n\nSequel to this, the Plaintiff made further cash transfers to his account on the 2nd and 7th December, 2019, and surprisingly, when notifications were sent to the Plaintiff, those cash deposits were illegally and wrongfully applied by the bank to a non-existent repayment obligation of the N23 million cooked up by the bank into the Plaintiff\u2019s firm account.\n\nIn a bid to get to the bottom of the fraudulent manipulation of the Plaintiff\u2019s account, the Plaintiff wrote the bank in his letter of December 2, 2019 received the same day to demand for the immediate removal of over N23 million illegally debited and posted into the Plaintiff\u2019s firm account.\n\nThe Plaintiff avers that the bank fraudulently manipulated his firm account and posted a bogus debit of over N23 million into the said account without his consent and no information was made available to him regarding this illegal and phony debit and there was no court order directing that this debit of over N23 million be posted into the Plaintiff\u2019s account.\n\nIn the statement of particulars of fraud, the Plaintiff stated that: He has no subsisting repayment obligation arising from any overdraft or transaction involving the use of depositors\u2019 funds at the instance of the Plaintiff to warrant any repayment obligation.\n\nThe bank appropriated the credit balance in the Plaintiff\u2019s account in excess of N76,000 in satisfaction of a sham and bogus debit of over N23 million.\n\nAll cash deposits and transfers made into the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account were utilized, converted and appropriated by the bank without seeking the Plaintiff\u2019s consent and without an order of court to that effect.\n\nThe bank discreetly narrated judgment sum payment to the Plaintiff\u2019s clients as fees paid to the Plaintiff when in fact there were no narration of services rendered by the Plaintiff to the bank to justify such.\n\nThe Defendant disguised the payment of N250 million to the Plaintiff\u2019s clients as fees to the Plaintiff to avoid payment of VAT and Witholding tax to the relevant government agencies.\n\nThe bank operated the Plaintiff\u2019s account outside the standard of good banking practice and that the bank conducted its banking business outside the ethical and professional manner consistent with global best practice.\n\nThe bank did not bring to the Plaintiff\u2019s attention the origin/source of the bogus and illegal debit of over N23 million posted to the Plaintiff\u2019s account as against the standard practice for a banking outfit to bring to the attention of their customers any form of activity or information concerning their accounts.\n\nThe bank breached the duty to exercise reasonable skill and care as well as that of confidentiality in the running of the Plaintiff\u2019s account.\n\nHe did not at any time apply for and utilize any overdraft facility, nor did he apply for credit facility from the bank to justify any set off or appropriation of the Plaintiff\u2019s credit balance or cash deposits made into the Plaintiff\u2019s account.\n\nThe Plaintiff shall rely on several Central Bank Of Nigeria (CBN)\u2019s circulars and regulations as well as code of conduct in the Nigerian Banking Industry signed to by the bank to prove various violations against the bank espoused above.\n\nThe Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage as a result of the fraudulent manipulation of his firm\u2019s account, depriving him access to his much needed funds in the said account and for several violations by the bank of crucial banking ethics and standard.\n\nConsequently the Plaintiff\u2019s claims against the Heritage Bank are as follows:\n\nA declaration that the bank was not entitled in law to appropriate and convert to its own use the credit balance of N76,000 and several other cash deposits made into the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account at various times in purported satisfaction of a non existing debt obligation allegedly owed to the bank by the Plaintiff thus breaching the fiduciary duty and duty of care owed the Plaintiff in the running and operation of the said Plaintiff\u2019s account.\n\nA declaration that the bank fraudulently manipulated the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account by surreptitiously hiding, disguising and posting a bogus debt of over N23 million into the Plaintiff \u2018s said account and the bank illegally coverted, appropriated and utilized all the credit balance and several other cash deposited into the Plaintiff\u2019s debit and of said account utilized in purported satisfaction of a non existing debt.\n\nA declaration that the bank failed to exercise reasonable skill and care in carrying out its banking business in relation to the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account, when the bank illegally debited the Plaintiff\u2019s account with the sum of over N23 million without any order of court and most importantly when the Plaintiff did not utilize any overdraft nor have any collateral transactional agreement for over draft or trade finance facility on the said account.\n\nAn order of the Court directing the bank to forthwith expunge and reverse the bogus illegal debit of the sum of N23 million applied to the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account and also immediately credit the Plaintiff\u2019s account with all sums already appropriated, converted and utilized by the bank with interest at Central Bank Premises prime lending rate of 25%.\n\nAn order of the Court directing the bank to pay the sum of N650 million as general, aggravated and exemplary damages for the outrageously reprehensible conduct of the bank occasioning loss and damage to the Plaintiff in the bank fraudulently manipulating, appropriating and converting the credit balance and other cash deposits made into the Plaintiff\u2019s account and for the bank\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable skill and care in the running of the Plaintiff\u2019s account and for the breach of fiduciary duty and confidentiality.\n\nCost of this action as the Court may deem fit to order.\n\nHeritage Bank, in its statement of defence denies all the allegation of facts contained in the statement of claim but admits that the Plaintiff opened a bank account so that the judgement sum in suit LD/7313/2014 may be paid into it.\n\nIn further denial of the Statement of Claim, the Heritage Bank states as follows: The narrations used to describe the payments made into the Plaintiff\u2019s accounts in February 2016, May 2016 and August 2016 were not manipulated but reflected the actual purpose/narration and that the Defendant acted at all times in line with extant rules and regulations and laws.\n\nThe Bank complied with all respect with the provisions and requirements of the Code of Conduct in the Nigerian Banking Industry.\n\nThe Code of Conduct places certain confidentiality obligations on the Defendant with respect to the Plaintiff\u2019s accounts and dealings.\n\nHowever, Paragraph 1.2(i)(a) of the Code of Conduct creates certain exceptions to the requirement of confidentially, and provides that: \u201cA member shall (ii) Not disclose or permit the disclosure to any third party, and confidential information concerning his employer\u2019s or his customers\u2019 business during or after employment except as required or permitted/enjoined by law thus; (a) where a bank is compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction or regulatory provision to do so\u201d.\n\nSection 31(d) of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act allows the Federal Inland Revenue Service to \u201crequire any person to give information as to any money, fund or other assets which may be held by him for, or of any money due from him to, any person\u201d.\n\nThe bank\u2019s compliance with the above provision therefore falls within the exception contained in Paragraph 1.2(i)(a) of the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe bank having been appointed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service as a Collecting Agent, therefore acted in line with the relevant statutory provisions when it released the Plaintiff\u2019s information to the Federal Inland Revenue Service.\n\nIn further denial of the Statement of Claim, the Bank states that the Plaintiff was indeed aware that a lien was place on his Account as the Plaintiff was informed by the bank\u2019s Branch Manager about the lien through a telephone call immediately it was placed.\n\nThe Bank states that the earlier lien placed on the Plaintiff\u2019s account was lifted not based on purported representations made by the Plaintiff to the Federal Inland Revenue Services, but rather it was based on the directives received from the Federal Inland Revenue Services dated 15 February 2019 which suspended the earlier freezing directives for a period of thirty (30) days to enable the affected taxpayers including the Plaintiff to regularise their tax status.\n\nThe Bank further avers that having received final notification from the Federal Inland Revenue Service that the Plaintiff had outstanding tax obligations and in the absence of any challenge from the Plaintiff to such notification, the bank was consequently entitled to treat the funds deposited by the Plaintiff in his accounts, in excess of N76,000.00 as not available to meet drawings.\n\nThere was no sham or bogus debit of over N23Million in the Plaintiff\u2019s account. Rather, a lien was legally and properly placed on the Plaintiff\u2019s account in view of the Plaintiff\u2019s failure to resolve all outstanding tax issues with the Federal Inland Revenue Service.\n\nIt was the Plaintiff\u2019s obligation to resolve all tax issues with the Federal Inland Revenue Service, and to forward documentation regarding such final resolution to the bank.\n\nThe bank has no power or control over how the Federal Inland Revenue Service calculates unpaid tax involving the Plaintiff, whether involving Company Income Tax or Value Added Tax.\n\nAll cash deposits and transfers made into the Plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2019s account were treated in accordance with the bank duties as contained in the extant provisions of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act.\n\nThe Bank further avers that the lien placed on the Plaintiff\u2019s Account has been lifted since 20 January 2020 and lodgements made by the Plaintiff in excess of N76,000 are reflected in the Plaintiff\u2019s account.\n\nThe Bank avers that the Claim of the Plaintiff is scandalous, highly vexatious, embarrassing, speculative and should be dismissed with substantial cost.",
          "summary": "The bank operated the Plaintiff\u2019s account outside the standard of good banking practice and that the bank conducted its banking business outside the ethical and professional manner consistent with global best practice.\nThe bank breached the duty to exercise reasonable skill and care as well as that of confidentiality in the running of the Plaintiff\u2019s account.\nSection 31(d) of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act allows the Federal Inland Revenue Service to \u201crequire any person to give information as to any money, fund or other assets which may be held by him for, or of any money due from him to, any person\u201d.\nRather, a lien was legally and properly placed on the Plaintiff\u2019s account in view of the Plaintiff\u2019s failure to resolve all outstanding tax issues with the Federal Inland Revenue Service.\nThe Bank further avers that the lien placed on the Plaintiff\u2019s Account has been lifted since 20 January 2020 and lodgements made by the Plaintiff in excess of N76,000 are reflected in the Plaintiff\u2019s account.",

          "text": "The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has begun mass demolition of illegal structures behind the old Federal Secretariat at Area I in Abuja.\n\nThe administration had in February, 2022 issued a demolition notice to owners of the structures with reminder on March 1 to leave the place.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the exercise on Wednesday, the Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to the minister, Ikaro Attah, said the rate of shanties in the area was worrisome and needed serious clean up.\n\nHe regretted that the secretariat that houses the Ministers of Interior, Trade and Investment have been taken over by the illegal structures which constituted security threat to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAttah explained that the demolition followed series of complains received about the area from security agencies and strategic persons, recently.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a lot worrisome, we have been receiving series of complains from security agencies and strategic persons, so as part of our efforts to clean the federal capital of shanties we have to start the pulling down of the illegal structures.\n\n\u201cThe FCT administration will not allow shanties to take over ministries of Interior and that of Trade and Investment with other key ministries.\n\n\u201cIt would have been done since last year but because of the wet season we had to leave it till now, dry season, even now is not easy but we have to do it. We warned them time without number to vacate the place.\u201d\n\nOn claims by owners of the illegal structures that they were Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Borno state, Attah said the IDPs were few in numbers at the fringes of the Dunamis church and near the main road.\n\nHowever, Senator Ali Ndume who represents Borno South in National Assembly visited the area during the exercise and called for profiling of the IDPs.\n\nNdume said, \u201cWe are all Nigerians, we must obey rules and regulations, there is nothing wrong demolishing structures serving as security threat to offices belonging to senior government officials, therefore let all of you that know that you are IDPs write down your names for proper documentation.\u201d\n\nReacting, the Chairman of IDPs in Area 1 Saidu Usman said: \u201cThe demolition will greatly affect us. Before people were farming in the area, until most of us who were displaced by Boko Haram decided to settle there with our families, by erecting houses in the area, and it\u2019s been more than 10 years now.\n\n\u201cWhen they came and marked buildings in the area, during which we were given three days to vacate the place, then I went and informed Senator Ali Ndume about the development.\n\n\u201cWe have many people having wives and children, but now they have removed their houses, so where will the displaced people go?\n\n\u201cAnd the Senator said we should follow the rules and regulations as the FCT Minister doesn\u2019t want this kind of things we are doing in the area. So we are ready to leave, as the government has made it clear that they don\u2019t want people to be there.\u201d",

This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and club.\n\n\u201cMoreover, I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated.\n\n\u201cThe foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine. This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery.\u201d\n\nAbramovich paid \u00a3140 million to buy Chelsea and the shrewd appointment of Jose Mourinho as manager helped shatter Manchester United and Arsenal\u2019s stranglehold on the Premier League.\n\nHe announced the impending sale less than an hour before Chelsea\u2019s FA Cup fifth-round tie at Championship side Luton.\n\nSpeaking before the match, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, told the BBC: \u201cThere are some things around the club and within the club we can not influence, so we were pretty busy preparing this game.\u201d\n\nAbramovich said he hopes to make one more visit to Stamford Bridge to say goodbye before the curtain falls on his 19-year reign.\n\n\u201cPlease know that this has been an incredibly difficult decision to make, and it pains me to part with the club in this manner,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt has been a privilege of a lifetime to be part of Chelsea FC and I am proud of all our joint achievements. Chelsea Football Club and its supporters will always be in my heart.\u201d",

          "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden warned Vladimir Putin that the Russian leader \u201chas no idea what\u2019s coming\u201d, as Western nations tightened an economic noose around Russia, whose invading forces bombarded Ukrainian cities and appeared poised for an advance on Kyiv.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the fighting since Putin ordered a full-scale invasion nearly a week ago, with a miles-long Russian military convoy north of Kyiv readying to advance on the capital.\n\nYet, Russia has failed to capture a Ukrainian single major city and Western analysts say Moscow appears to have fallen back on tactics which call for devastating shelling of built-up areas before entering them.\n\n\u201cWhile he may make gains on the battlefield \u2013 he will pay a continuing high price over the long run,\u201d Biden said in his State of the Union address. Straying from the prepared text, Biden added \u201cHe has no idea what\u2019s coming.\u201d He did not elaborate.\n\nU.S. lawmakers stood, applauded and roared, many of them waving Ukrainian flags and wearing the country\u2019s blue and yellow colours, as Biden delivered his address to the chamber of the House of Representatives. read more\n\nA senior U.S. defense official said on Tuesday the invading force\u2019s advance on Kyiv has stalled due to logistics problems, including shortages of food and fuel, and some units appeared to have low morale.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters that it was unclear whether the convoy itself had stalled, but it was not making much progress. read more\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Russia to stop bombarding civilians and resume talks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table,\u201d he told Reuters and CNN in a joint interview in a heavily guarded government compound in Kyiv.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly is set to reprimand Russia on Wednesday for invading Ukraine and demand that Moscow stop fighting and withdraw its military forces, a move that aims to diplomatically isolate Russia at the world body.\n\nBy Tuesday evening nearly half the 193-member General Assembly had signed on as co-sponsors of a draft resolution ahead of a vote on Wednesday, diplomats said.

The United Nations says at least 136 civilians have been killed in the invasion, but that the real number of people is likely much higher.\n\nVastly outmatched by Russia\u2019s military, in terms of raw numbers and firepower, Ukraine\u2019s own air force is still flying and its air defences are still deemed to be viable \u2013 a fact that is baffling military experts.\n\n\u201cThe airspace is actively contested every day,\u201d a senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. read more\n\n\u2018FREEZE AND SEIZE\u2019\n\nBiden announced a further ratcheting up of sanctions on Moscow, joining the European Union and Canada in banning Russian planes from U.S. airspace. He also said the Justice Department would seek to seize the yachts, luxury apartments and private jets of wealthy Russians with ties to Putin.\n\nFollowing a call with Group of Seven officials, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States had agreed with G7 partners to convene a task force \u201cto freeze and seize the assets of key Russian elites\u201d.\n\nUkraine, a Western-leaning democratic country of 44 million people which is not a member of NATO, has called on the U.S.-led military alliance to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine \u2013 a request rejected by Washington, which fears stoking a direct conflict between the world\u2019s two biggest nuclear powers.\n\nWashington and its allies have instead sent weapons to Kyiv.\n\nSeveral dozen Japanese men have answered a Ukrainian call for foreign volunteers to fight Russia\u2019s invasion, according to a media report on Wednesday.\n\nIsolating Russia diplomatically, the West\u2019s main strategy is shutting off Russia\u2019s economy from the global financial system, pushing international companies to halt sales, cut ties, and dump tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of investments.\n\nExxon Mobil joined other major Western energy companies including British BP PLC and Shell in announcing it would quit oil-rich Russia over the invasion.\n\nApple Inc stopped sales of iPhones and other products in Russia, and was making changes to its Maps app to protect civilians in Ukraine. Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google dropped Russian state publishers from its news, and Ford Motor suspended operations in the country.\n\nU.S. airplane manufacturer Boeing (BA.N) said it was suspending parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines. read more\n\nRussia on Tuesday placed temporary restrictions on foreigners seeking to exit Russia assets, meaning that billions of dollars worth of securities held by foreigners are at risk of being trapped.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "Nigeria Says 70% of Armed Forces Engage in Domestic Policing Due to Insecurity",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has disclosed that about 70 per cent of officers of the Nigerian Armed forces are currently engaged in domestic policing operations in the country.\n\nThis was revealed on Tuesday in Lagos, by Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, when he presented the keynote speech during the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) 2022 Security Meet Business Dialogue Series.\n\nMustapha, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary for Political Economic Affairs, Office of the SGF, Mr. Andrew Adejoh, also stated that the federal government\u2019s 2022 budget for all the security agencies, excluding its statutory contribution to the Police Trust Fund, was N2.41 trillion.\n\nHe said: \u201cClose to 70 per cent of Nigerian armed forces personnel are engaged in policing duties across the 36 states of the federation. That is not what the army is supposed to do. But we have to do that to solve our security problems.\n\n\u201cThe security vote for this year is actually N2.41 trillion. This does not include the statutory allocation to the Police Trust Fund.\n\n\u201cBut money alone will not solve the problem. We need to look at the process and procedures to make sure that the money is put to useful purposes.\u201d\n\nHe also said the federal government was highly disturbed by the escalating security challenges in the country, adding that, \u201cit seemed a number of Nigerians have turned these security challenges into business. But the government is trying as much as it could not to let them have a breathing space.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, who was represented by Major General Adeyemi Yekini, said over 23,000 repentant Boko Haram combatants have so far surrendered their arms to the Nigerian military along with their families, and are now undergoing programme meant to reintegrate them to the society under the government\u2019s Operation Safe Corridor.\n\nIrabor said: \u201cThe popular one, which people do not want to hear about, is the rehabilitation of repentant Boko Haram that have surrendered their weapons. And over 23,000 of them have surrendered to the Nigerian armed forces, thereby helping to mop up small arms in circulation.\n\n\u201cOperation Safe Corridor is about disarmament and reintegration. The aim is to give them (repentant Boko Haram members) skills so that they can go back to their local communities and engage themselves in useful purposes.\u201d\n\nHe added that the military believed that some of the Boko Haram fighters were attracted to terrorism out of frustration caused by economic hardship.\n\nHe also maintained that the military was not interested in politics. \u201cLet me tell you point blank: the military is not interested in politics. We are out to do our job as professional soldiers that defend the territorial integrity of Nigeria and while remaining obedient to civil authorities.\u201d\n\nThe President of the LCCI, Dr. Michael Olawale-Cole, said in his opening remarks that Nigeria was ranked 146 among 163 countries in the 2021 Global Peace Index (GPI) of the Institute of Economics and Peace, which stated that improvements in peace could lead to considerable economic improvement in GDP growth, inflation, and employment.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor the government to achieve better results in confronting insecurity, a key factor is to tackle the root causes and stem degeneration into social disorder and instability. The high level of unemployment and poverty among Nigerians, especially the youths, has consistently attracted them to crimes. Failure to address challenges of poverty, unemployment, and business failures is one of the major factors fueling insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cAs we approach an election year, we recommend that the government separate politics from security and that the security agencies stay off politics. And there is a need to step up enlightenment campaigns against political violence as this could lay an extra burden on our security agencies as they contend with bandits, terrorists, and kidnappers across the country.\n\n\u201cThere have been calls for open and frank dialogue as a critical factor in addressing the security challenges of the nation, using the media and stakeholders\u2019 forums as a catalyst for cooperation among citizens to end the crises.\u201d",
