          "text": "The Chairman, Governing Council of the Nigerian Bar Association, Young Lawyers Forum, Tobi Adebowale, has called for continuous legal education for Nigerian lawyers, yesterday. This urgent call was in a bid to boost their productivity and financial strength.\n\nAdebowale told NAN that knowledge and skill are the greatest tools of lawyers. He said that this tool can be acquired and sustained through continuous legal education.\n\nAccording to the young lawyer, the dearth of knowledge on the part of some lawyers has led to their low earning capacities, but he asserted that with a continuing grasp of knowledge, and evolving new ideas lawyers will earn more.\n\n\u201cThe witty saying that \u2018a good lawyer knows the law and a great lawyer knows the judge\u2019 has some merit.\n\n\u201cBut those who practice the profession know that technical depth, versatility, commercial awareness, and soft professional skills, remain the foundational block to success within the legal profession.\n\n\u201cMany times, the knowledge and skills required to succeed as a lawyer are not taught in schools and may even elude some who choose to embark on the expedition on their own, without some initial guidance and coaching,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Adebowale, \u201cthe dearth of knowledge in diverse areas of law practice\u201d has contributed a great deal to the low earning capacity of most lawyers in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that this has also resulted in unemployment or underemployment of lawyers in many parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThis dearth has also shifted revenue that should ordinarily accrue to Nigerian lawyers to their counterparts outside Nigeria, or to few lawyers in selected jurisdictions who dare to \u2018do more\u2019 by growing their skills and knowledge,\u201d he said.\n\nAdebowale said that the increasing presence of foreign lawyers in Nigeria, travelling in and out, to advise on some of the most significant transactions involving Nigerian businesses, is a testament to the fact that there is work yet to be done.\n\nHe blamed this on the capacity of Nigerian law firms and lawyers, to deal with such matters effectively and efficiently.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the NBA to play its role in bridging the gap by ensuring that the earning capacity of its lawyers through continuous legal education is not lost.\n\n\u201cThis can be achieved in various ways, including through regulation of lawyers\u2019 professional fees, advocating for increased roles of lawyers in the public and private sectors, and through initiatives that encourage lawyers to expand the scope of their practice,\u201d he said.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "By Steve Oko\n\nThe Prelate and Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria, His Eminence Nzie Nsi Eke, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari, to shelve any plans to hike the price of petroleum products.\n\nAny upward review of the price of fuel according to the cleric will only worsen the living condition of Nigerians who are already impoverished by the prevailing harsh economic condition of the country.\n\nThe Prelate who made the appeal in his Christmas and New Year message regretted that the hopes and expectations most Nigerians had at the beginning of 2021 had been dashed.\n\nHe also called for the immediate release of all political detainees and detained agitators of self determination, while advocating dialogue with the agitators as panacea to the rising tension in the country.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhile we acknowledge the efforts of our governments at all levels to valiantly steer the wheel of governance despite prevailing challenges, we are constrained to admit that the year 2021 has been a tough one for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe hopes and fervor that ushered in the year at the beginning began to wane soon after as citizens were confronted with more strenuous situations than what was experienced in the previous years.\n\n\u201d The issue of insecurity became more serious with the number of Nigerians sent to their early graves by terrorists in form of bandits increased significantly.\n\nREAD ALSO: Ganduje invites NSE to inspect ongoing Muhammadu Buhari Interchange Flyover in Kano\n\n\u201cThe cost of living continued to increase astronomically that many families can no longer afford to feed twice a day.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Nigeria remains the poverty capital of the world remains disturbing. Because of the perceived marginalization as alleged by many ethnic nationalities, the agitation for separation or at least the restructuring of the Nigerian polity has become more stringent.\n\n\u201cIn view of these, I am calling on our leaders to give Nigerians the following gifts as we move into the new year:\n\n\u201cRescind the alleged plan to increase fuel pump price. Nigerians cannot afford this extra burden. It is a known fact that every increase in fuel price results in a domino effect on the cost of all other goods and services.\n\n\u201d Reverse the cost of domestic gas which has increased by as much as 300% within the last year in many parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cReduce the social tension among the various ethnic groups by releasing all political detainees and explore dialogue and political solutions to all agitations.\n\n\u201cPave way for free and credible general election in 2023 by enacting enabling laws and making INEC truly independent.\n\n\u201cResolutely address the seemingly intractable security challenges in various parts of the nation, especially in the Northwest and Northeast by classifying and designating bandits who operate in these areas as terrorists (their modus operandi portray them as such) thereby empowering the security agencies to handle them appropriately.\u201d\n\nThe Prelate believed that \u201cwith the assurance of these gifts, Nigerians can enter the new year with hope and renewed confidence in their government\u2019s ability to manage the country better.\u201d\n\nHe called for more prayers for the country and urged Christians to use the season to empathize with the less privileged and destitute in society.\n\n\u201cSo, as we celebrate Christmas and New Year, let us remember that our world is still hurting and people are still suffering different levels of deprivation, molestation, insecurity, natural disasters, hunger, malnutrition, discrimination, oppression, diseases, wars and so on.\n\n\u201cThese people need our gifts. Ours gifts of prayers, good thoughts, visitations, assistance and show of love will go a long way in restoring hope and joy to them.\u201d.\n\nOn the way forward, the Prelate said:\u201dI enjoin us to remember that Jesus Christ is the ultimate gift God has given as a solution to the world\u2019s problems and challenges. Allowing him into our hearts and situations will bring divine god\u2019s intervention\u201d.",

          "title": "Desmond \u201cArch\u201d Mpilo Tutu (1931\u20132021)",
          "text": "In the aftermath of the Presidential election crisis of 1993, discussions between me and Dr Doyinsola Abiola, wife of president-elect Moshood Abiola, publisher of the opposition Concord Newspapers, strategic thinker and discreet mobiliser for \u201cJune 12,\u201d invariably devolved into a comparison of our notes on the unfolding situation in South Africa and its implications for Nigeria.\n\nEach of us had made three separate but overlapping visits to South Africa during which we met and held discussions with many of the leading political officials and non-state actors.\n\nAt our meetings back home in Nigeria, we would in the light of what we had read about them and our interactions with them, weigh the personalities we had met, dissect them, and delineate their dominant characteristics so as to gain their support and understanding on the \u201cJune 12\u201d debacle.\n\nAt such sessions, it was Dr Abiola who provided the sharpest insights and the summative judgements.\n\nWhen you met Nelson Mandela, she would say, you knew that you were in the presence of greatness. It flowed from every pore of his skin, from the simplest gesture, or act, to pronouncements requiring the most profound deliberation. It seemed so effortless.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWith Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr Abiola would say, you knew you were in the presence of goodness. You almost couldn\u2019t imagine him committing any wrongdoing.\n\nDesmond Mpilo Tutu, Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, leader of the anti-apartheid struggle, moral voice for global civil and human rights and one of the most influential theologians of our time, died on December 26, 2021, at the Oasis Care Centre, in Cape Town, aged 90.\n\nTutu rose from humble beginning and the fraught circumstances that the racist White minority apartheid rule reserved for the Black majority to become, by sheer force of will, determination and steadfastness to principle to become one of the most influential voices of this century.\n\nFor his generation, the clergy was one of the few routes out of the daily grind of apartheid. Law and teaching were open, but only up to a point. The system was designed to make it well-nigh impossible for Blacks to reach their potential. As Hendrik Verwoerd, Minister of Bantu Education and later prime minister articulated it, the goal was to equip the natives to function at a level no higher than that of domestic servant.\n\nThere clings in my memory a 1961 TIME magazine story in which a white policer espied a black man sprawled across the floor in a Whites-only church.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d demanded the scandalised police officer.\n\n\u201cCleaning the floor, bass,\u201d came the tremulous reply.\n\n\u201cGood that you are only cleaning the floor,\u201d the officer said, as he caressed his sjambok. If you had been praying, you would have needed help from above.\u201d\n\nEven if the story is apocryphal, it captures eloquently the essence of the apartheid spirit: Blacks may worship or claim to worship the same God as their superiors, but they must do so in separate, water-tight compartments.\n\nOliver Reginald (OR) Tambo, a founder and later president of the ANC, grew up dreaming of becoming a medical doctor. He had the best result in the qualifying examination held throughout the country. But under apartheid rules, that was forbidden territory. Faithful to Tambo\u2019s unfulfilled dream, the South African government named the country\u2019s largest hospital complex after him. It also renamed Johannesburg\u2019s international airport in his memory.\n\nSo, like millions of Blacks before him, Tutu had to settle for a future not of his own choosing but one charted by others.\n\nThat future, the priesthood, was one for which Providence seemed to have prepared him in diverse ways. He was enormously gifted in empathy and sympathy. He could feel the pain of others. He could identify with other people and insert himself in their circumstances. He could communicate eloquently and relate to audiences large and small in ways that made them feel that their privations were also his own. And, oh, he could sing, and he could dance!\n\nHe had the gift of spontaneity. Words, gestures and symbolic action came naturally to him. He was a true believer. With him, there was no playacting, no faking. His strictures on the bestialities of apartheid were heartfelt; his moral revulsion, eloquent.\n\nYet, even in that miasma, he often found cause for joy and laughter in little things. That laughter was infectious, and so was his effervescence. It dispelled the gloom of the moment and the awkwardness of the occasion. He led by example, not precept. He was an apostle of nonviolence, but acknowledged the limit of that doctrine when he declared that he was not a pacifist.\n\nAt the height of the carnage in South Africa\u2019s townships and in the 1980s, he was moved to declare that if he belonged in the generation of the young men and women stirring the urban revolt, he would have rejected the leadership of Tutu\u2019s generation because it was producing no meaningful change, only ever more brutal reprisals.\n\nStill he never lost faith that the struggle could be won.\n\nAnd when it was won, there was no happier person in the world than Desmond Tutu. I can still see him on the long, snaking queue as he waited to cast his ballot in South Africa\u2019s general elections for the first time in his life. Even now, I can still see him holding up his ballot in triumph at the point of casting it and having done so, burst into his trademark dance, chirpy and engaging as ever.\n\nWhen apartheid fell and the new Black majority government that took over from Mandela departed from the core principles that had animated[OD1] the anti-apartheid struggle and undergirded the new dispensation, Tutu was unsparing. He rebuked them just as fiercely as he had disavowed the apartheid regime.\n\nHe reminded the new people at every opportunity that the basic task of government was to serve the people and improve their living standards. Catering principally to the privileges of the elite, he stated, again and again, was a betrayal of the struggle.\n\nTutu\u2019s outspokenness irritated the governing elite and their allies in the new oligarchy. They called him all manner of names and sought to discredit him. But because he was anchored in what he believed to be the word of God and the purpose for which he was called to the Ministry, he never wavered.\n\nHis close friendship with Nelson Mandela never had him flinch from disagreeing with him on matters of strategy while holding fast to fundamental principles. He was a democrat\u2019s democrat. The protests he led were lessons in civic engagement and participation.\n\nNo greater testament to Tutu\u2019s greatness can be found anywhere other than in his lived example and in comments that have poured forth from across the world since his passing. They bespeak genuine affection and appreciation from across the world for his life of service, truth and honesty.\n\nHe held no elected office and wielded no political power. Yet he parlayed the role that his calling imposed on him into statesmanship of the rarest kind. It should indeed be said of Desmond Mpilo Tutu that he gave statesmanship itself a whole new meaning. His life was untainted by scandal.\n\nMay his vision of justice based on restitution rather than retribution grow and thrive, and may his idea of South Africa as a Rainbow Nation count for more than a slogan.",

          "title": "Harvest of deaths from fatal gas explosions",
          "text": "Like a dammed river suddenly losing its fetters, a gale of domestic gas accidents has rocked the country, leaving in its wake avoidable fatalities. LUCAS AJANAKU writes.\n\nShe sat down under a canopy barley large enough to provide shelter for her and her protruding stomach. She gazed straight into the sky and hot tears dropped from her swollen eyes. Amarachi, a dealer in plastic chairs, buckets and other household utensils, along Apapa Oshodi Expressway, picked her phone and placed a call to Gbagada General Hospital Burns Unit where her childhood friend, Blessing (not real name), mother of three, was receiving treatment from the burns she suffered during a domestic accident in her kitchen.\n\n\u201cMama Ejima, please be strong. Don\u2019t lose hope. God will heal you. You will not die in Jesus\u2019 name. Cling to your creator,\u201d Amarachi was heard encouraging her.\n\nAccording to her, the rumour mill had gone berserk that she too had passed on. Since visiting time for visitors at the hospital was still far, she had to call her husband and insisted she spoke with her directly.\n\n\u201cShe is my very close friend. She entered her kitchen and lit a stick of matches only for her and her friend to be enveloped in a huge flame. There must have been a leakage in her cooking gas called Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). While her friend died before help could come, she was rushed to Gbagada General Hospital. I am so sad because the family is struggling to make ends meet. The lady has a set of twins that are less than two years old. They had a child already before the twins came,\u201d Amarachi said.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs Nigerians were bracing for Christmas, residents of Ojekunle Street of Ladipo Market, arguably the largest in the country, were thrown into mourning, no thanks to a gas explosion that rocked a shop used by mechanics.\n\n\u201cFour adults, comprising three males and one female, were recovered dead,\u201d Southwest Coordinator, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Ibrahim Farinloye said, adding that a 10-year-old boy who was rescued alive died on his way to the hospital.\n\nThe fire broke out after a cylinder exploded at a gas shop in the densely populated Mushin area of Lagos.\n\nIt was put out in about one hour and \u201cwe were able to rescue 10 people alive and they have been treated and discharged on the spot,\u201d Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said.\n\nThe cause of the explosion is not known yet but authorities are suspecting one of the gas cylinders exploded as a result of a fire close to the gas shop and work being done on one of the cylinders.\n\n\u201cOut of the four bodies (one was) a woman who was said to be frying (food items) while Sodiq (another victim) was operating on a cylinder,\u201d Farinloye said.\n\nAt the scene of the explosion, a crowd lined behind a barricade as rescue workers and some residents carried away the gas cylinders left within the premises while remains of the vehicles destroyed were packed at one corner.\n\nBalogun Mubaraq, a resident in the area, said many people with various degrees of burns were rushed to a local hospital.\n\nJohnson Omitola, a mechanic in the area, said one of those killed is a motorcyclist whose head was rudely chopped off as he rode past the scene. \u201cIt is sad that people died but the casualty figure would have been more than 50 had people fully opened their shops. Only the woman that sells akara was identified with her full body. There were shredded human parts littering the adjoining streets,\u201d Omitola said, calling for strict regulation of gas retailing in the country.\n\nThe fire destroyed three shops, six shanties and about 12 vehicles, said Olajide Ogabi of the Lagos State Fire Service. He faulted the location of the gas shop within a residential area and along a power line and said the shop was once closed by the state government because of its location.\n\nSometime on June 17, 2021, there was another gas tragedy. At about 10:32 pm precisely when people were returning home from work, an LPG tanker exploded at OPIC Plaza on Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, beside the popular Lagos Sheraton Hotels and Towers, Ikeja.\n\nThis unfortunate incident saw no fewer than 13 persons sustaining various degrees of injuries and about 25 cars destroyed.\n\nFarinloye said the explosion resulted in a fire outbreak that engulfed the premises of Ogun State Property Investment Company (OPIC) Plaza beside Sheraton Hotels, which houses different commercial outfits including a supermarket and a Chinese Restaurant. The fire was put out at about 12.30 am, through the efforts of five fire trucks from the Lagos State Fire Service and two trucks from the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency Response Unit. When the dust settled, the fire had considerably damaged both lives and livelihoods in the vicinity.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2020 similar incidents happened in Abule-Egba, Ijegun, Ile-Epo, Oke-Odo, Baruwa, and Abule Ado, all in Lagos.\n\nIn Baruwa, an LPG plant located along densely populated Candos Road, Baruwa, Ipaja-Ayobo, in Ipaja/Ayobo LCDA, suddenly exploded and engulfed the entire area, killing at least 13 persons. Several other persons were injured, while properties worth millions of naira were destroyed.\n\nThere were, however, conflicting figures of casualties as government officials claimed that eight persons died, but an eyewitness claimed he saw about 13 charred bodies recovered from the scene of the fire.\n\nThe casualties included women and children. One of the women, identified simply as Mrs. Adebowale, 55, died on the cenotaph of her late husband in front of their house.\n\nShe was said to have died while trying to retrieve from the house the money she borrowed as loan from one of the microfinance banks.\n\nOther victims were 39-year old Olushola Adeleke and his two-year-old son, Martial. An official of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Adeleke had escaped the inferno but remembered promising Martial was still in the building. His bold attempt to rescue his beloved son proved futile as both were consumed by a huge pall of fire from the gas accident.\n\nAmong survivors were a mother and two children who were taken to Gbagada General Hospital Burns Unit for medical attention.\n\nIt was gathered that an LPG tanker was in the process of discharging its content at the Best Roof Gas Plant Station but unfortunately, the station\u2019s generating set was running and in the process sparked which exploded and threw the discharging tanker across the road.\n\nDirector-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, blamed the incident on negligence on the part of the operators.\n\nGiving the post disaster assessment of the explosion, he said a total number of eight bodies were recovered at the scene while 15 victims suffered major burns and have been transferred to Gbagada General Hospital Burns Unit.\n\nSimilarly, he said 25 buildings were damaged during the explosion out of which 10 were severely affected.\n\nAlso, 16 shops, a private school building and a hotel were razed while a Pentecostal Church, Folem was mildly affected.\n\nHe urged residents to report dangerous practices within their neighborhoods to the relevant agencies.\n\nAgain, on Christmas Eve, there was pandemonium at the Ayobo Ipaja area of the state over a gas explosion that occurred in the area on Friday.\n\nThe explosion, it was gathered, happened around 1 am.\n\nDetails of the explosion were sketchy. Unconfirmed report stated that the Chairman of Ayobo-Ipaja Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Mrs Bola Shobowale, confirmed the development.\n\nResidents of the area took to social media. One of them, @IamHorlapo, posted, \u201cA year ago, we woke up to a gas explosion in Baruwa. Today, it\u2019s another Pipeline explosion in the same Local Government which has claimed life and property. God has mercy upon us in this community.\n\n@iamoliver_may22 added, \u201cGuys, please. My street in Baruwa is burning. Guys, please send help to Baruwa\u2026 There is a gas explosion and there is a power line in that area.\u201d\n\nThese explosions and tragic deaths are coming at a time the Federal Government is stepping up campaigns on the need for Nigerians to drop kerosene and charcoal for gas as a cheaper and cleaner cooking fuel.\n\nDomestic LPG consumption\n\nNigeria\u2019s per capita consumption of LPG is still low when compared with the population.\n\nIt is estimated that the country will be saving about $10billion yearly if 50 per cent of the populace embrace the use of LPG implying that there is correlation between its usage and poverty reduction.\n\nThe World Bank Group\u2019s Oil, Gas, and Mining Unit, Sustainable Energy Department, in its study on: The Role of Liquefied Petroleum Gas in Reducing Energy Poverty, said increasing household use of LPG is one of several pathways to meet the goal of universal access to clean cooking and heating solutions by 2030, as stated in the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Energy for All Initiative.\n\nThe UN\u2019 Sustainable Energy for All Initiative, launched in 2011, sets as one of its three objectives universal access to modern energy services\u2014electricity and clean cooking and heating systems by 2030.\n\nThe group said about three billion people rely on solid biomass or coal for cooking and heating, and smoke from such fuel use is estimated to cause four deaths every minute. Universal access will require a multi-pronged approach: advanced cook stoves for biomass and other solid fuels, natural gas for urban households in countries that have or are developing an extensive gas pipeline network, biogas, and LPG. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that more than 40 per cent of households newly gaining access to modern household energy by 2030 in the universal-access scenario will do so by switching to LPG.\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s priority objective is to attain five million metric tons (Mt) of LPG consumption next year, which puts the national consumption target at 83.33,000 MT monthly from 2018 to 2022 estimates.\n\nThe defunct Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) said Nigerians consumed 89,910Mt, of LPG in January 2020, 7.9 per cent above the national consumption target of 83,330Mt.\n\nIt said over the past two years, domestic LPG consumption has steadily been on the upward swing.\n\nPunitive cost\n\nThe World Bank group noted that global LPG prices have more than doubled in real terms in the last decade, increasing at an annual average rate of nine per cent since 2001. This rate of increase is much higher than that for household income in most developing countries. Prices are now sharply higher.\n\n\u201cEven in an efficient market with light tax on LPG, cooking and heating water with LPG would require upwards of $15 every month at today\u2019s LPG prices. As such, LPG is unlikely to be the fuel of the poor,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) blamed the international cost of LPG and the interplay of foreign exchange (forex) for hike in cost and sought full domestication of the product\u2019s market to guard against its volatility like oil prices.\n\nIts Executive Secretary, Mr Bassey Essien, in a statement, said the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) produces four million metric tons of gas yearly, but allocates 350,000Mt for domestic consumption.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe, as marketers, are saying that NLNG and others producing LPG should domesticate it by dedicating sufficient quantity that will cover our domestic consumption.\n\n\u201cWe have watched the continuous spike in the price of cooking gas, moving from N4 million to N5 million for a 20MT truck to the current price of N5.3 million within a month interval.\n\n\u201cThe current high price of cooking gas is not traceable to marketers (plant owners) or terminal owners but rather to the vagaries of the international price of the commodity and interplay of foreign exchange rates.\n\n\u201cNigeria consumes about one million Mt of LPG yearly and 65 per cent of the products are imported by marketers.\n\nLPG retailers explain Ladipo fire\n\nThe Liquefied Petroleum Gas Retailers (LPGAR) branch of National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) said the explosion at Ladipo Spare Part Market, Lagos was caused by acetylene gas.\n\nIts National Secretary, Olukayode Solomon, in a statement, commiserated with the families of the victims of the explosion.\n\nHe said the incident was not in any way related to LPG which is popularly called cooking gas.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is important to state clearly that the outlet in which the explosion occurred was specifically an acetylene gas outlet.\n\n\u201cIt is important to state clearly that the outlet in which the explosion occurred was specifically an acetylene gas outlet.\n\n\u201cThe explosions of these industrial gasses often cause wide scale destruction similar to military bombs unlike LPG explosion which often causes inferno.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, damage arising from LPG explosions usually comes as a result of spread of its inferno based on the level of gas leakage and spread.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, industrial gasses such as acetylene and oxygen usually pull down structures around the scene of the explosion because of the high pressure of the industrial gasses as well as the very heavy weight of the industrial gas cylinders.\n\n\u201cAlso, acetylene and oxygen gasses do not use the same cylinders used for LPG as exemplified by the type of cylinders that littered around the scene of the explosion yesterday.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to note that acetylene and oxygen gasses are not derived from the same sources as LPG,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that acetylene was also not regulated by the same agency that regulates LPG.\n\nMr Solomon noted that LPG was derived from petroleum and natural gas and regulated by the former Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) now replaced with Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\n\u201cThe regulation of acetylene gas, oxygen gas and the other related gasses is presently located within the federal ministry in charge of industry.\n\n\u201cThese clarifications have become necessary to forestall further misrepresentation of facts whenever an explosion relating to gas occurs.\n\n\u201cWe equally use this opportunity to implore the media as a whole to always seek clarifications before publication.\n\n\u201cThis is because this particular misrepresentation has been a regular occurrence in the recent time,\u201d he said.\n\nLPG marketers react\n\nReacting to the spate of gas tragedies sweeping across the country, NALPGAM has called for improvement in the handling and distribution of LPG to ensure safety.\n\nEssien said there\u2019s need to improve safety in handling and distribution of LPG.\n\nAccording to him, the frequency of explosions and fatalities was becoming worrisome, which is not good for the image of Nigeria and the gas business itself.\n\n\u201cAs an association, we have always tried our best to heighten the awareness on the safe handling of LPG at homes, at retail shops and in transit.\n\n\u201cWe have a training centre where we undertake training in collaboration with consultants to the Department of Petroleum Resources on the safe handling and trucking of LPG,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the group was awaiting a comprehensive report of what led to the incident from the relevant authorities and would utilise its recommendations to enhance safety.\n\nEssien said while the Federal Government was working on encouraging more Nigerians to switch to gas as energy of choice, such incidents were capable of thwarting the efforts of the government.\n\nThere was, therefore, a need for every operator to adhere to the safety measures put in place to safeguard the usage and distribution of LPG at all times.\n\nEssien said strict regulation and monitoring should be extended to inflammable products such as acetylene and other industrial gases. He warned that filling and retailing of industrial gases have to be strictly monitored.\n\n\u201cRegulators should pay attention to the activities of practitioners dealing in acetylene and other industrial gases so as to check these recurrent incidences. Failure to do this and the frequent misrepresentation in the media attributing acetylene explosions to cooking gas will erode consumers\u2019 confidence in the use of LPG and heighten the fear factor that cooking gas usage is unsafe,\u201d he warned.\n\nCauses of LPG explosion\n\nAn expert said an LPG explosion is almost always caused by the accumulation of gas leak in an enclosed space combined with an ignition source, not a propane-LPG tank explosion (gas cylinder explosion). The leak can be from the gas appliance or other source not involving the bottle.\n\nMedswift, a leading First Aid, Fire Safety & Occupational Safety and Health Trainers in Kenya, said gas leakage is fuel in its final stage of ignition and can cause a fire explosion if left unattended.\n\nDetecting gas leak\n\nMedswift said gas cannot be seen, but it can be smelt. However, there are other ways where a gas leak could be detected.\n\n\u201cIf your flame is orange or yellow instead of blue and leaves soot on your cooking appliances; listen to identify a hissing sound from your gas connection or the banner.\n\n\u201cIf you detect or suspect that there is a gas leak in your home. Take the following measures to mitigate the threat.\n\n\u201cTurn off the gas supply to ensure there are no more leaks; open all doors windows and any ventilation to ensure fresh air circulation in the house.\n\n\u201cDo not use electric devices such as laptops and phones. These things cause a spark which can cause the already leaked gas to ignite.\n\n\u201cDo not smoke, or use any open flames such as a candle because it can cause the leaked gas to explode, hence causing a fire,\u201d the group said.\n\nAverting gas leaks\n\nPrevention, it said, is better and easier than cure. So, conscious action must be taken to prevent gas leaks in homes.\n\nMedswift gives some tips that can be used to ensure that there is no gas leak in homes. Some of them are: ensure your burner is tightly secured; check your appliances for wear and tear and ensure that they are serviced regularly; and inspect the LPG pipes after every refill before using.\n\nPreventing cylinder explosion\n\nDomestic gas cylinder if not well handled can lead to fatal accidents such as explosions. Therefore learning how to prevent gas cylinder explosion is important. The following are safety tips that you can apply when handling gas cylinders.\n\n\u201cKeep the gas knob out of reach for children when not using,; make sure that the kitchen or cooking area is well ventilated for a good flow of air in case of a gas leak; educate people around you on gas cylinder safety measures and how to use and handle gas cylinders; do not use Meko for long hours while cooking; LPG cylinders should be bought from authorized dealers only.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital to follow the guidelines and educate the elders and kids about the handling of LPG cylinders, preventive measures and do\u2019s and don\u2019ts in case of an emergency. However, there\u2019s no need to be fearful of LPG cylinders as they are of high tenacity. It is by proper maintenance of gas appliances that LPG explosions can be averted,\u201d Medswift said, warning that on arrival at an incident involving fire, stop, observe, think: do not enter the area. A minor fire can escalate in minutes to a serious blaze. Call for emergency help and wait for it to arrive.\n\nOfficial response\n\nThe Lagos State government had set up a team to monitor outlets where gas is stored in commercial quantities and carry out a safety audit in the state. So far, 1,850 places were surveyed out of which 15 were closed for not complying with safety standards, according to Director-General, Lagos State Safety Commission, Lanre Mojola.\n\nIn July this year, exasperated by the spate of gas explosions, particularly in Lagos, the Senate directed its Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream and Gas) to conduct an investigation into the remote and immediate causes of the explosion at the Ladipo Spare Parts Market, Mushin, Lagos. The Senate urged authorities to design a strategy to regulate the use of old gas cylinders, arguing that \u201cthe continued use of old cylinders can cause explosions especially in poorly controlled environments\u201d.\n\nA committee was set up to investigate the incident and look at \u201cwhat led to this,\u201d Oke-Osanyintolu of the LASEMA had also said.\n\nNMDPRA\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of Nigerian Downstream and Midstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) were unsuccessful as calls put to Mr Elvis Duruji, one of its officials weren\u2019t picked.\n\nThe implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) may have put spanners in the wheels of policing the industry.\n\nAccording to the Act, two regulatory agencies are to perform the duties of the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), PPPRA and Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF). The new agencies are the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURC) and the NMDPRA.\n\nNMDPRA was created in August 2021 in line with the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 which provides legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian Petroleum Industry as well as development of host communities.\n\nEven before the creation of NMDPRA, policing the industry by the DPR was such a Herculean task as the agency was hampered in the discharge of its duties by manpower shortage. Under the old dispensation, the Lagos office of DPR had the mandate to police Ogun State too. So it was hardly any surprise sharp practices continued to flourish in the downstream oil sector.\n\nA visit to the website of NMDPRA said it \u201cis responsible for the regulation of the midstream and downstream petroleum operations in Nigeria which includes technical, operational, and commercial activities.\n\nUnfortunately, there was no information on subjects such as LPG Plant Licence; LPG Retailer (CAT D) Licence, Stock and Product Sufficiency Report, AQUILA Marketers\u2019 Portal, Retail Outlet monitoring System (ROMS), LPG Depot License, Depot License, Downstream Remote Monitoring System (DRMS)/E-Station, Lube Oil Blending Plant (LOBP)m and Refining Plant License (RPL), which were all created.\n\nOthers are Lube Storage and Sales License (LSSL), Petroleum Product Import and Export Permit system (IMPEX), Crude Oil Terminal Export Permit (COTEX), CNG Compression License, IMPEX Gas Permit, Gas Terminal Export Portal (GATEX), Network Code Electronic Licensing and Administrative System NCELAS. A click to any of these items led to nowhere.\n\n\u201cOur site is undergoing a major upgrade,\u201d offered elixir to the frustrations.\n\nExperts say to avert these gas tragedies, it is important to educate households on the need to gradually replace their metal gas cylinders with fibre cylinders, which is said to be fire- resistant. Also, the promise to phase out and replace the gas cylinders in circulation with more advanced ones should be hastened. According to findings, some households have been using the same cylinders for upwards of two decades. That is surely a disaster waiting to happen. Besides, the relevant authorities need to constantly sensitise operators of all gas retail outlets on how to operate their business with minimal risks to health, safety and environment (HSE).",

          "text": "The Federal Government is set for the deployment of 12 Super Tucano jets against bandits as part of concerted efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari to end terrorism before 2023.\n\nAs a prelude to the deployment, government has also started perfecting the conditions for the release of a gazette, which will legally classify bandits as terrorists.\n\nAlready, the government has secured a court order declaring bandits as terrorists.\n\nBut, the United States (U.S.) has not given a blank cheque to Nigeria on the use of the fighter jets.\n\nThe U.S. has floated a monthly schedule to monitor the deployment of the jets, the battle grounds and the purpose of the deployment.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSome U.S. officers have been coming to Nigeria to evaluate the use of the jets in line with the terms of sale, it was learnt yesterday.\n\nSources said the Super Tucano jets will be deployed as soon as the gazette against bandits is out.\n\nThe Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice last night confirmed that the procedures were almost met.\n\nIt was learnt that the Armed Forces, top government officials and some states and communities held hostage were excited about the news of imminent deployment.\n\nA source, who spoke in confidence with our correspondent, said the court declaration of bandits as terrorists was an impetus to the war against insurgency.\n\nThe source said: \u201cYou know that the Federal Government, on its own, went to court and got the judgment declaring bandits as terrorists. This has excited everyone.\n\n\u201cThe American suppliers of the aircraft needed to be assured that Nigeria will keep to the terms of the sale, which is to strictly use them against terrorists.\n\n\u201cNow that the courts have said so, you should expect the deployment of the aircraft as soon as all processes, including the gazetting of the judgment, are completed.\n\n\u201cBut, even before this is done, new platforms are being received and deployed and you can see the devastating effects of the nation\u2019s airpower on the terrorists and bandits in the Northeast and the Northwest.\n\nThe source added: \u201cLast week\u2019s Nigeria Air Force bombing of the camp of the notorious bandit, Turji, in Zamfara State, is a case in point. Things are changing very rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu said: \u201cWe in the presidency are excited by the decision of the court.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice said the procedures for the gazette on bandits were almost done.\n\nThe Special Adviser on Media to the AGF, Dr. Umaru Gwandu, said: \u201cThe Federal Government has published the proscription order in two national dailies as a requirement.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has also ordered that the order be in the gazette. I am optimistic that the Nigerian public will soon see the published order in the gazette. I think if it is not out, it could be out any moment from now.\u201d\n\nHowever, the U.S. has not given a blank cheque to Nigeria on the use of the Super Tucano jets.\n\nApart from limiting the jets for campaign only against terrorists in the North, a US team has been monthly auditing their operations.\n\nThe condition made the Federal Government to apply to a High Court to declare bandits as terrorists, said the source.\n\nAlso, the U.S. has been \u201cvery strict\u201d in evaluating the deployment of the jets to avoid abuse by the military,\n\nThe source added: \u201cEvery month, a team from the U.S. used to come to audit the deployment of the jets. They have asked us to ensure that the number of hours of operations will be registered in the box; where the jets have been to for operations and for what specific purposes.\n\n\u201cThey sold the aircraft to us but they did not give us a blank cheque on how to use these aircraft. We have kept to the terms and we are winning the war. This is why the President directed the Armed Forces to end the war before his exit in 2023.\u201d\n\nIn October, the U.S. Principal Deputy National Security Advisor, Jonathan Finer, said the terms of the agreement during the sale of the 12 Tucano aircraft were unambiguous.\n\nFiner said: \u201cWe are pleased to deepen our security cooperation with the Nigerian government. I think we made very clear our expectations about this platform where it would be used and in the right way and we are always raising concerns when we have them and that it is true with all our security partners around the world.\n\n\u201cThis is an important platform for security, particularly in the North, and we are pleased the transaction is finally concluded.\u201d",

          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mallam Abubakar Malami (SAN), has justified President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s rejection of the Electoral Amendment Bill.\n\nHe said the President withheld assent to the Bill and returned it to the National Assembly in the overall interest of Nigerians.\n\nPresidential spokesman Femi Adesina urged lawmakers not to take hasty decision, but to consider every available option.\n\nMalami said senators and House of Representatives members were only concerned about their political inclination in drafting the bill, noting that the cost implications of direct primary were huge.\n\nThe AGF, who spoke during an Hausa programme on Radio Kano, said the President has rights to take decision on any bill presented to him.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe said the President will only sign laws that are sustainable.\n\nThe Hausa audio version of the interview on Sunday was made available to The Nation by the Special Adviser on Media to the AGF, Dr. Umaru Gwandu.\n\nGwandu confirmed that the English transcript reflected what Malami said in Hausa.\n\nThe AGF said the President was not in office for politicians alone.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat you should understand about leadership of the country, most especially as it regards President Muhammadu Buhari on any law presented to him for signing, the president is entitled to certain rights.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about politics, he has rights. If you talk about economy, the business community also has rights on him. If you are talking about 60 per cent of Nigerians that are not politicians, if you talk about the economy, he also has rights. If you are talking about security, there is also what is expected from him. The president has to consider laws that are sustainable.\n\n\u201cThe job of the president is that of politics, economy, business, security, legislations, politicians and non-politicians.\n\n\u201cThis is because the leadership of the country is not for the politicians alone. It is a leadership that affects social life of the people, their religion, economy, security and others. This is contrary to the leadership of the legislators, which is solely political.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the lawmakers are only concerned about their political inclination while the president is concerned about the entire lives of Nigerian made up of politicians and non- politicians.\n\n\u201cAny bill signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari is in the interest of all Nigerians, irrespective of their inclinations. He is after satisfying the interest of the over 200 million Nigerians he is serving and not a particular sector.\u201d\n\nExplaining the cumbersomeness of direct primaries, Malami said: \u201dOne of the reasons is that there are 18 political parties and a law is founded that will allow for direct primaries.\n\n\u201cThe difference between this and the general election is small because it allows for all Nigerians to come about and say their opinions.\n\n\u201cThis means that you will repeat the general elections 18 times. Today, INEC requires N305 billion for the 2022 general elections Now, if the general elections will cost this much, how much will it cost to do the same election in the APC? It might cost at least N200 billion because it will involve everyone.\n\n\u201cAlthough the good side of the law is that INEC is required to monitor it. Therefore, if it is assumed that every political party will spend N200 billion, how much will then be spent in conducting the same primary election in 18 political parties just to produce a qualified candidate?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s assume there are about 60 million politicians in the country. What about the remaining over 160 million Nigerians, who have nothing to do with politics? Are you fair to them?\n\n\u201cAll the people want are good projects, good road from Abuja to Kano, potable drinking water, good education, school feeding programme and the rest of them. Are you fair to the 160 million Nigerians using their wealth just to conduct primary to produce a party candidate, despite other demands by the public?\n\n\u201cMy answer to this is that, to spend this N305 billion that will be given to the INEC and the about N200 billion to be given to the political parties is not fair to the remaining 160 million Nigerians who have no business about politics and political appointments. Their business is just a better life in Nigeria. This is the issue of cost implications.\u201d\n\nFielding questions on \u2018Sunday Politics\u2019, a Channels Television programme on Sunday, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, justified Buhari\u2019s decision to decline assent to the amended Electoral Bill.\n\nHe said overriding the President\u2019s veto was not the best option opened the lawmakers.\n\nAdesina added: \u201cUnder democracy, the legislators have the right to override the President. But is toeing that path the most expedient thing to do now when there are other options open to the lawmakers?\u201d",

          "text": "The 2019 governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA) in Imo state, Uche Nwosu, has opened up on how he was \u2018abducted\u2019 on Sunday in a Gestapo style by security operatives.\n\nHe said the operatives who acted on the orders of one Shafa, whom he described as the Chief Security Officer (CSO) of the Imo State Government House\u201d, threatened to \u201cblow off my head if I did not follow them.\u201d\n\nNwosu, who is the son-in-law of the former Governor Rochas Okorocha, added that he was first driven to the Government House in Owerri before being taken to Enugu where he was put in a private jet for a flight to Abuja.\n\nThe politician had earlier yesterday confirmed through his Spokesman, Chikezie Nwadike, that he was freed the same day. He also claimed he was not invited by any security agency, prior to his ordeal.\n\nNwosu was arrested during an outing service in honour of his late mother, Jemamah Nwosu, at St. Peter\u2019s Anglican Church, Eziama-Obaire in Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe incident led to a verbal altercation between the senator representing Imo West in the National Assembly, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, and the Imo State Government.\n\nThe government, which had distanced itself from the arrest, yesterday condemned the fact that it was carried out on church premises. Also yesterday, the state Police Command claimed that \u201cofficially,\u201d it was not aware that Nwosu had regained his freedom.\n\nBriefing reporters in Abuja, Nwosu, who is also an All Progressives Congress(APC) chieftain, said the invasion of the church by the operatives and his arrest were uncalled for as there was no prior invitation by the Police or any other security agency.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile the service was going on, some heavily armed security men invaded the church from different doors. While some went straight to the alter, others were walking from one line of the pew to the other.\n\n\u201dWhen they spotted me, they opened fire and started shooting inside the church, some of them walked up to me and said I should get up and follow them or they will blow off my head. I demanded to know who they were and where they were taking me, but they started dragging me. All the while, they were still shooting and everyone in the church was scampering for safety.\n\n\u201dIt was like a war; they kept shooting inside the church and everybody was running in different directions. It was just an act of God that stray bullets didn\u2019t hit any of the clergymen because they were firing straight at the alter.\n\n\u201dAfter they dragged me from the church into their car, they drove off., When we got to Owerri, three of the cars drove into the Government House and they drove me in one of the cars to Enugu\u201d.\n\n\u201dOn the way, they stopped after one of them answered a phone call and said Shafa, who is the CSO asked them to get my pictures. They tore my clothes and took my pictures with handcuffs and sent them to the CSO.\n\n\u201dAfter that, they drove me straight to Enugu Airport, where a chartered private jet was waiting and they flew me straight to Abuja. It was at Abuja that it was discovered that the Police hierarchy was not aware of the operation. It was purely planned and hatched at the Imo Government House.\n\n\u201dI was not invited by the Police or any other security Agency before my abduction from the church\u201d.\n\n*Imo govt regrets invasion of church\n\nBut the Imo State Police Command Spokesman, Michael Abatham, told The Nation on the telephone yesterday, that \u201dofficially,\u201d the police were not aware of Nwosu\u2019s release.\n\nAbattam said the command would not hesitate to issue an official statement the moment they became aware of the release of Nwosu.\n\nThe state government said yesterday that it was aware of the \u201cfutile efforts\u201d by some people to whip up public sentiments against it over the incident.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said in a statement that such people were already de-emphasising the \u201cpossible criminality\u201d behind Nwosu\u2019s arrest by playing up the desecration of a church.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, while the government believes that no stone should be spared in the effort to rid the state of criminality and banditry, it will not support any form of disrespect for a place of worship by security agencies,.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the arrest of Mr. Nwosu within the church premises could have been avoided and therefore stands condemned.\n\n\u201cWhile government regrets the manner the arrest was made, we wish to emphasise that since it was purely a security matter, the full reason why such an action was taken will eventually unfold, and perhaps guide the public better.\n\n\u201cGovernment, therefore, wishes to appeal to those negatively affected by the action to bear with the security agencies.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Senator Hope Uzodinma, holds the Anglican Communion in very high esteem and will never support any act that will disrespect her reverential status as a place of divine worship.\n\n\u201cGovernment will continue to protect the interest of citizens of the state while not impeding the work of security agencies..\u201d\n\nThe state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has defended the arrest of the AA candidate, saying the law is no respecter of persons.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nIn a bid to strengthen the security architecture of Yorubaland, leader of the apex Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), Prof Banji Akintoye, has unveiled a mobile application and alert system, designed to track kidnapped victims and expose danger anywhere in Yorubaland.\n\nThe mobile application named Pajawiri (emergency) launched in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, according to Akintoye, can also expose criminal elements wherever they are once the victims have the application installed in their phones, irrespective of whether the phone is switched on or off.\n\nHe explained that provision has also been made for Yoruba people that do not have android phones to enjoy the services, saying the security system also has another system called Afinihan, which can be used by those without android phones to link up with those with the full application.\n\nAkintoye, who joined the event via virtual platform, said the emergence of Pajawiri is an evidence that the Yoruba people are too intellectually sophisticated to be subdued.\n\n\u201cWe have now proven to the world that we cannot be captured nor be subdued. We are too intellectually sophisticated to be subdued. These nnovations and intellectual powers are what we will deploy to get ourselves out of the quagmires of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn the benefits of the application, Akintoye, in a statement by his Communications Manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, said: \u201cEvery person in possession of the Pajawiri App on their telephone will be able to activate it instantly, whenever they find themselves in danger. By activating the App, they will be able to alert their families, their friends and their neighbours that they are in danger and that they need help.\n\n\u201cIn that way, no Yoruba person needs to be alone anywhere on their farms, schools, market places, shops and anywhere else. Any person who finds himself threatened by danger and who is in possession of Pajawiri will be able to alert other persons for help.\n\n\u201cIn short, Yoruba people today, are able now to enjoy security individually and collectively through the use of the App known as Pajawiri. The Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide owes our engineers who have put this together an enormous debt of gratitude. The Yoruba people also owe a lot of gratitude to the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oduduwa, for all the encouragement and support that they have given to these engineers.\n\n\u201cThe creators of this App, Pajawiri, have magnanimously offered to put this App Pajawiri freely at the disposal of every Yoruba person for the next 30 days. That is from now till the 21st of January, 2022. This means that all Yoruba people can have the protection of Pajawiri without paying any fees for the next 30 days.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cAfter that, those who chose to continue to enjoy the protection of Pajawiri will be able to do so with an affordable monthly subscription. That is for those of us who have Smart phones(android, iOS or IPhone). For those of us who do not have smart phones, a hand-held alert device named \u2018Afinihan\u2019, has been designed to work equally as effectively as the Pajawiri on the IPhone.\n\n\u201cAfinihan, a tiny hand-held device that is able to perform wonders. This tiny device has been efficiently tested and will be available for purchase at a small affordable price. The purpose of all these technological provisions, is that the Yoruba nation must carry all its people along in this provision of security.\u201d\n\nOn the ideal features and benefits of the App, coordinator of the Pajawiri Project, Ayobami Abolaji, a United States-based IT expert, explained that the App is a system for warning and protection through an alarm and alert system that will generate protective action for the community and each individual user.\n\n\u201cThe P\u00e0j\u00e1w\u00ecr\u00ec App is designed to provide a technological solution or a system that allows people to warn others of impending dangers and arouse established response teams in the communities to stop and prevent various vices such as: kidnapping, raping, armed robbery, arson, theft, accidents, murders and banditry against app users and their community members.\n\n\u201cThe P\u00e0j\u00e1w\u00ecr\u00ec App is a technologically savvy information and communication application that alerts and locates the source and flashpoints of dangerous security breaches, where unchallenged massacre of valuable human lives and property are perpetrated. The P\u00e0j\u00e1w\u00ecr\u00ec App proffers a modern day means of curbing or permanently alleviating the fear that has gripped the inhabitants of any geographical location and settlements once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe P\u00e0j\u00e1w\u00ecr\u00ec App was designed to be activated through a referral process only, in order to be able to know the identities of the app users and detect suspicious and criminal elements disguising as real users. It will be free to download by any users and will be operational after the referral activated for the new user to have the referral identification.\n\n\u201cAfinihan is an Android and I-Phone (iOS) compatible application device that sends alert signals to the connected phone systems. It is a mobile alarm system that allows those without hand held phones to connect to and alert those with the smart phones and computer devices set up at data command and control centers established at various perimeters in the geographical entities that the app is operating from.\n\nPresent at the unveiling of the app were pioneer Commissioner for Education in Osun State and immediate past chairman of Ilana Omo Oodua, Prof. Wale Adeniran; immediate past general secretary of Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, George Akinola; Kayode Akinwande and Akinsola Adejuwon, among others.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nBishop of Anglican Communion, Kaduna Diocese, Timothy Yahaya, has said the refusal of President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the Electoral Act amendment bill as one of the indices that Nigeria has not started practising democracy.\n\nHe said if senators knew that National Assembly is the oxygen of democracy, they should override the president and pass the bill into law.\n\nHe said since senators could not override the president and veto the bill, they should be ready to wear the toga of rubber-stamp in the eyes of citizens.\n\nThe cleric stated this in his Christmas message where he lamented the increasing insecurity in the country and urged that all measures be put in place to ensure peace reign.\n\n\u201cTo be candid with you, Mr. President\u2019s refusal to sign the Electoral Act amendment Bill means Nigeria has not started democracy; what we are practising for now is \u201cThem owncracy.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

But the people out there who claim they are representing us are they actually representing us? You journalists go and do investigate journalism, you will discover that some people hijacked the process of party primary, down to even the elections.\n\n\u201cIt is only in Nigeria that people easily die in election. Ballot box stuffing and snatching do happen. It is only in Nigeria that terrorists will be busy killing people in their thousands. We don\u2019t have 36,000 police to go and quell the problem of human degradation but when there was an election in Anambra State, Ogun State and elsewhere, how many vehicles were on ground? That tells you \u201cThem own cracy.\u201d They are not ready to let go, Nigeria has become a cow they are milking every day. It is not about the people, it is about what they will get out of the system. It is about corruption, it is about looting, it is about inhumanity to man by the class of people that rule us today.\u201d\n\nThe cleric said the elements of democracy should be for the people to decide who rules them.\n\n\u201cIt must be the voice of the people; democracy is the voice of the majority. How can you explain the flimsy reasons given for not signing the Electoral Act? I think there will be a rethink and the right thing will be done so that for the first time, Nigeria will say there will be free and fair elections. This government cannot deliver anything to Nigerians. How can they not for once give Nigerians an electoral process that is acceptable.\n\n\u201cI am talking to the National Assembly members\u2026I am not talking to Mr. President because he had already told us his mind; that he is not going to sign the electoral bill.

And if the National Assembly wants the people to clap for them, and the name rubber stamp removed from them, it is time to show it.

          "title": "Shell, ExxonMobil Face Huge Remediation Costs over Abandoned Onshore Assets",
          "text": "Shell, ExxonMobil Face Huge Remediation Costs over Abandoned Onshore Assets\n\n\u2022Aiteo considers options against multinational oil company over Nembe spill\n\n\u2022Sector not ripe for full-blown deactivation processes, says industry regulator\n\n\u2022Stakeholders want enforcement of rules\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nShell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria and ExxonMobil are presently faced with huge remediation costs over their failure to properly decommission and cap oil and gas assets across the Niger Delta, especially the ones sold to Nigerians in recent divesture programmes. A situation that creates severe environmental risks and pollution to host communities in the oil-rich Niger Delta.\n\nTHISDAY gathered from stakeholders that the recent case of Aiteo\u2019s Nembe wellhead blowout, brought to the fore the need to enforce the relevant laws and to ensure that the multinationals that sold the assets to the Nigerian companies pay remediation charges.\n\nWhile Aiteo is presently engaged in a legal tussle with Shell, seeking the sum of over $2.5 billion compensation over the sale of Oil Mining Licence 29, THISDAY gathered that the Nigerian oil and gas company is also considering fresh legal action against the multinational over the Nembe spill and other wells not properly capped.\n\nOn the other hand, Seplat Energy Plc last month announced that together with its partner, that it was in competitive discussions to acquire ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian shallow water business. With this, stakeholders have expressed concern about what would happen if the deal is sealed and some of the ExxonMobil\u2019s assets that were not properly capped causes another environment challenge.\n\n\u201cThe present environment challenge is what is likely going to be faced when Shell sells it entire SPDC oil blocs in the Niger Delta without properly capping the oil wells and providing for remediation\u201d an oil and gas expert who pleaded to remain anonymous stated.\n\nFindings by THISDAY have revealed that many of the oil and gas assets sold to Nigerians, mostly by the International Oil Companies (IOCs), are rarely decommissioned or properly abandoned, a development that clearly breaches existing laws regulating the industry.\n\nDecommissioning is the cessation of operations at an oil and gas platform and returning the seafloor to its pre-production state for installations and any relevant structures that have come to the end of their productive life.\n\nOnshore decommissioning involves capping oil wells, clean-up and taking out all production and pipeline risers that are sustained by the platform, removing the platform and getting rid of it in a junk storage area or manufacturing yard.\n\nInternational conventions guiding decommissioning operations include the Geneva Convention on the continental shelf, 1958; United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982; and Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matters, 1972.\n\nBut despite extant regulations and the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), THISDAY learnt that there was rarely any adherence to full decommissioning for the infrastructure that had been sold and there might be no such arrangements for those for which buyers were being sought.\n\nAccording to Section 232, (1) of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), \u201cThe decommissioning and abandonment of petroleum wells, installations, structures, utilities, plants and pipelines for petroleum operations on land and offshore shall be conducted in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice.\u201d\n\nIn Section, 233 (1), the new law affirms, \u201cEach lessee and licensee shall set up, maintain and manage a decommissioning fund held by a financial institution that is not an affiliate of the lessee or licensee, in the form of an escrow account accessible by the commission.\n\n\u201cThe decommissioning and abandonment fund shall exclusively be used to pay for decommissioning and abandonment costs. Where a lessee or a licensee fails to comply with the decommissioning and abandonment plan, the decommissioning and abandonment fund shall be accessed by the commission to pay for the performance by a third party.\u201d\n\nArising from one of the deals, Aiteo recently claimed in a suit that it paid $799 million to Shell for the acquisition of the NCTL pipelines and the assets and that $389.6 million had been lost by the company as a result of the leakages in the pipelines and the degraded conditions of the asset.\n\nAiteo also claimed that $933 million had been expended for the repairs of the pipelines and acquisition of equipment, including well-heads, generators, and pumps, as well as replacement of the flow lines within the NCTL, which it bought from Shell.\n\nIt was learnt that the big oil companies had continued to sell \u201cdead\u201d assets to the country\u2019s local businessmen under the guise that they could no longer cope with militancy or community issues, especially in the Niger Delta.\n\nWhat they have not told buyers is that there would be huge remediation cost down the line from over 30 to 40 years of neglect.\n\nThe recent case of Aiteo\u2019s Nembe wellhead blowout, stakeholders said, brought to the fore the need to enforce the relevant laws and implement proper shutdowns of oil and gas assets in the abandonment and restoration process. Many experts believe that if the wellhead was properly and permanently plugged and decommissioned, since it was not commercially viable, the blowout that happened in Nembe would have been avoided.\n\nIt is believed that Nigeria\u2019s transitory regulatory environment and inability of the authorities to strengthen environmental and petroleum laws for the deactivation of abandoned wells and aging oil facilities have also not helped matters.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the immediate past Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), Nigeria Council, Joe Nwakwue, stated that the availability of regulations had not always been the problem, but enforcement. However, he explained that it was not wholly an IOC issue, noting that there are usually agreements with whoever is buying non-producing assets on steps to take to decommission them.\n\nNwakwue said, \u201cThere are regulations around assets that are no longer in use and it has nothing to do with the transfer of the assets. So, whether it\u2019s Shell or Aiteo, for instance, there are rules.\n\n\u201cWhen a wellhead is no longer producing, there are two steps: it is either there\u2019s a TP&A, which is to temporarily plug and abandon it or you permanently plug and abandon.\n\n\u201cThe problem was that neither of those happened, so that means that it was still theoretically operational. There was need to have abandoned the well when it was no longer in use. That didn\u2019t happen and that\u2019s why we had that spill.\u201d\n\nHe said it did not matter who owned the assets because transfer was a different issue entirely, which should not be mixed up with the decommissioning process.\n\nAccording to Nwakwue, \u201cWhat happened to the commitments? When you talk about asset transfer you\u2019re talking about decommissioning commitment, because when you are selling the assets that\u2019s when the issue of who should decommission will come in because it goes into the pricing.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m buying an asset from you with what is called retirement obligation, I will have to deduct that cost from what I will pay you. I am sure that Shell transferred its commitment to Aiteo.\u201d\n\nNwakwue maintained that the Aiteo facility was just one of several that had been left without proper decommissioning operation, noting that there are even many more assets that have not been sold.\n\nHe held, \u201cThere might be a lot of wellheads that are no longer producing but they are active, they are exposed to pressure. Whoever owns the asset should have a programme to temporarily abandon them to make them safer.\n\n\u201cThere are regulations, but who is monitoring? That is the question. Who is ensuring that the regulations are followed? Those are the questions that need to be answered.\n\n\u201cThe regulator should step up their game. They need to have a programme where facilities that are not no longer in use are temporarily or permanently abandoned and decommissioned to keep the environment safe.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of who is operating them, the primary issue is that there are regulations that have not been followed through and is important that the commission is alive to those responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSecretary General of the Niger Delta Ethnic Nationalities, Capt. Bassey Henshaw, told THISDAY that the oil companies must clean up the environment they had degraded over the years as well as pay compensation before any talk about leaving their onshore and shallow water operations in the region.\n\nHenshaw said, \u201cWe do not dispute the fact that they can go green or whatever, but there has to be some closure. You have a business running and there are issues emanating from those businesses. You do not wake up and say you are going green. All the issues have to be fixed and resolved.\n\n\u201cWe cannot hold them to ransom if they want to leave, but they have to have a closure of the previous business they have done, the degradation of the environment, the oil spillages and all.\u201d\n\nAn oil industry enthusiast, who had covered the sector widely, Ms Ijeoma Nwogwugwu, wrote in a recent article, \u201cAs a result, oil multinationals that want to avoid spending several millions of dollars on decommissioning, have taken advantage of the loopholes by selling their oil assets, including aging and rusting infrastructure, to local oil firms.\n\n\u201cSince the late 2000s, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have sold their stakes in about 20 to 25 oil blocks to local oil operators at ridiculously exorbitant prices.\n\n\u201cAll the acquisitions were leveraged buyouts that left several Nigerian banks with massive exposures to the oil and gas sector. Many of the loans are yet to be repaid to date.\u201d\n\nNwogwugwu said one way to avoid this debacle was to adopt what obtains in other jurisdictions where it is mandatory, prior to asset sale, for prospective bidders to possess the wherewithal to decommission aging oil and gas infrastructure. She mentioned the $3 billion sale of the Bass Strait operation in Australia, as a case in point.\n\nBut in a reaction, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), the industry regulator, stressed that the industry was not mature enough for wholesale decommissioning activities.\n\nHead, Health Safety and Environment, NUPRC, Mr Afeez Balogun, told THISDAY that for divested assets, the buying companies were always encouraged to look holistically at the liabilities and factor them into the purchase arrangements.\n\nAccording to Balogun, \u201cThe premise for full-blown decommissioning is not yet there in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, as many of the assets still have long mileage to offer. Add to that the fact that we are currently investing technology for improved oil recovery that will save a lot of costs and further increase the mileage of these assets.\n\n\u201cSo, there is really no crisis, as many uninformed people would want to assume. However, for divested assets, the buying companies are always encouraged to look holistically at the liabilities and factor that into the purchase arrangements.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the divesting companies are currently the big ones that have JV agreements with NNPC, and we are aware that decommissioning arrangements with the companies are being put in place.\u201d\n\nHowever, he stated that the PIA was now more explicit and gave more strength and bite to the rudimentary regulations that the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) already had in place.\n\n\u201cSo, before we reach a crisis level, if we ever will, all these arrangements should have given us adequate protection to make things easier,\u201d Balogun said.\n\n\u201cWe are also watching and are set to tap from all the numerous innovations being brought about by the developed world on decommissioning on all fronts, including environmental and legal considerations, technology, service provision and financing,\u201d he added.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, recently said the federal government would carefully scrutinise oil companies that would bid for the takeover of assets that Shell and other oil majors will be divesting from in the country.\n\n\u201cIn the past, companies were just allowed to buy assets that they had no capacity to operate. We would no longer allow that to happen again because government is the ultimate loser,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nShell and ExxonMobil are two of the most vocal IOCs in the country, which have been in talks to sell off some of their assets, especially those onshore and in shallow waters.\n\nA leading global oil and gas consulting firm, Wood McKenzie, had put the total value of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), the subsidiary Shell proposes to totally divest from, at $2.3 billion.\n\nAccording to the document, 19 Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) will be put up for sale by the oil giant in onshore locations and shallow waters in the company\u2019s eastern and western operations in the Niger Delta.\n\nOnly last month, Nigerian oil and gas company, Seplat Energy, revealed that it was actively engaged in negotiations to acquire ExxonMobil\u2019s shallow water assets in the country. A Reuters report had in 2019 put the expected potential disposals at $3 billion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Almost 11,000 flights are delayed.\n\n\u201cThe nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation,\u201d a United memo obtained by CNN disclosed.\n\nAccording to the CNN, globally, airlines cancelled more than 6,000 flights on Christmas Eve, Christmas and the day after Christmas. In the United States, more than 1,200 flights were cancelled and more than 5,000 were delayed on Sunday alone as staff and crew call out sick.\n\nThe cancellations come at the busiest time of year for air travel. The US Transportation Security Administration said it screened millions of people each day over the holiday weekend, peaking at 2.19 million travelers on Thursday, December 23. On Wednesday, more people passed through TSA checkpoints than on the same day in 2019.\n\nAlaska Airlines, which cancelled 133 flights of 19 per cent of its operations Monday, attributed its cancellations and delays on winter weather in the Pacific Northwest. The airline said it cancelled almost 250 mainline flights scheduled to arrive or depart from Seattle Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has the most delays and cancellations in the world, according to FlightAware.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working as quickly as possible to get all our affected guests rebooked on other flights, while operating safely,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement. \u201cReservations is experiencing extremely long hold times of up to 11 hours.\u201d\n\nSaturday air travel was a bit slower because of the flight cancellations: More than 1.53 million people passed through security checkpoints Saturday.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) said last week it had to cancel hundreds of flights because it lacked enough crew members to safely fly all of its scheduled routes.\n\nDelta (DAL) said it was working to get all stranded travelers home as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans,\u201d Delta said in a statement. \u201cDelta people are working hard to get them to where they need to be as quickly and as safely as possible on the next available flight.\u201d\n\nEuropean airlines also experienced a small number of cancellations amid record-breaking numbers of COVID-19 cases in several European nations.\n\nA British Airways spokesperson told CNN yesterday that the airline had cancelled, \u201ca number of flights due to operational constraints,\u201d and were instead using larger aircrafts, where possible, to get customers to their destinations. According to tracking website FlightAware, 46 flights from British Airways were cancelled yesterday.\n\nVirgin Atlantic told CNN flying continues \u201cas scheduled,\u201d noting the exception of one of their London Heathrow \u2014 New York JFK rotations which saw cancellations on December 21.\n\nA Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told CNN: \u201cWe continue to take pre-emptive measures to uphold operational and staffing resilience, always putting the health and safety of our customers and people first.\u201d\n\nAlso, German airline, Lufthansa, said it would cancel 10 per cent of its winter flight schedule as the pandemic continues to hit the aviation industry.\n\nIn an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung last week, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said that due to \u201ca sharp drop in bookings\u201d the airline will have to cancel 33,000 flights from mid-January to February 2022 or 10% of the group\u2019s winter flight schedule.\n\nSpohr\u2019s comments were confirmed to CNN by the Lufthansa press office.\n\nMeanwhile, the CDC also shortened the recommended time for people to quarantine if they are exposed to the virus to a similar five days if they are vaccinated and often to no time if they are boosted.\n\n\u201cGiven what we currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to 5 days, if asymptomatic, followed by 5 days of wearing a mask when around others,\u201d CNN quoted a CDC statement to have disclosed.\n\n\u201cThe change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after. Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for five days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimise the risk of infecting others,\u201d it added.\n\nQuarantine refers to the time people stay away from others if they are exposed to a disease but not yet testing positive or showing symptoms.\n\nCDC changed those recommendations, too.\n\n\u201cFor people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than two months after the J&J vaccine) and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for five days followed by strict mask use for an additional five days,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cAlternatively, if a 5-day quarantine is not feasible, it is imperative that an exposed person wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure. Individuals who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure. For all those exposed, best practice would also include a test for SARS-CoV-2 at day 5 after exposure. If symptoms occur, individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative test confirms symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022New rate almost doubles 2021 budget benchmark of $40pb\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nOil prices rose over three per cent yesterday on hopes that the Omicron COVID-19 variant would have limited impact on global demand in 2022, even as surging cases caused flight cancellations in some countries.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude rose $2.59, or 3.40 per cent, to $78.73 a barrel yesterday, while the United States West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.01, or 2.7 per cent, to $75.80 a barrel.\n\nPrices of oil which had plunged by more than 10 per cent on November 26, when reports of a new variant first appeared, started to gain last week after early data suggested that Omicron could cause a milder level of illness.\n\nAlthough the variant had been spreading faster than any COVID-19 variant yet, there\u2019s been some relatively relieving news that most people infected with Omicron showed mild symptoms so far.\n\nHowever, more than 1,300 flights were cancelled by US airlines on Sunday as COVID-19 reduced the number of available crews while several cruise ships had to cancel stops.\n\nThis caused disruption to the supply of goods and services from isolating workers, notably air travel, although the global recovery story for 2022 still remains on track.\n\nBrent has risen by more than 45 per cent this year, supported by recovering demand and supply cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+.\n\nOn January 4, the producer alliance would decide whether to go ahead with a planned 400,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) production increase in February, but the cartel has so far stuck to its plans at its last meeting to boost output for January despite Omicron.\n\nOPEC has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by the 400,000 bpd each month, with Nigeria lagging behind for months.\n\nBut the country, a very active OPEC member had said even if prices fell to between $50 to $60, it won\u2019t be much of an issue, with the country\u2019s oil benchmark for the 2021 budget being $40.\n\nNigeria has failed for months to meet its allocation, due largely to waning investment, ageing upstream infrastructure and disruptions by some local host communities.\n\nBut the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) last week assured that by the year\u2019s end, Nigeria should be able to produce about 1.7 million bpd. That target now looks almost impossible.\n\nOn December 22, Nigeria\u2019s federal lawmakers approved a N17.126 trillion ($38 billion) budget for 2022, anchored on an oil price benchmark of $62 per barrel.\n\nThe approved oil price assumption was higher than the $57 per barrel price that President Muhammadu Buhari had proposed to the parliament on October 7, and also higher than the oil price benchmark of $40 per barrel adopted by the government for the 2021 budget.\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the increase in oil price was to reflect the current market values of the oil barrel in the international market and to generate more funds for critical sectors of the economy.\n\nHowever, the parliament retained the oil production target of 1.88 million bpd, including condensate production of between 300,000-400,000 bpd, for the purpose of its revenue calculation in 2022.\n\nThis compared to the output target of 1.86 million bpd the government had set for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nIn all, oil exports account for around 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange revenue, although the country has battled with a sharp drop in revenue amid a drop in production.\n\nNigeria has the capacity to pump around 2.2 million b/d of crude and condensate, but in recent months its output has been languishing below 1.55 million bpd.\n\nIn November, the NNPC was only able to contribute about N10.5 billion of its projected N122 billion to the federation account jointly run by the federal, state and local governments in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Wants inclusion of CONHESS adjustment in 2022 budget\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nHealth workers under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) and the Assembly of Healthcare Professional Associations (AHPA) have accepted the increase in the hazard allowance approved by the federal government.\n\nHowever, the unions appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to include the adjusted Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS) in the 2022 appropriation bill before its passage.\n\nThe health workers said any attempt to do otherwise could be met with stiff resistance.\n\nJOHESU Chairman, Biobelemoye Josiah, who spoke on a national television network monitored in Abuja on Monday, said though the new hazard allowance was not exactly what they wanted, the workers have accepted it in the meantime.\n\nOn the adjustments made to the hazard allowance, Josiah said the unions had accepted the explanation offered by the federal government.\n\n\u201cAs for the approval of the hazard allowance it is not where we wanted to be but as far as we are concerned government pleaded that that is what they can afford for now. Inasmuch as we would have loved it to be higher than what we asked for, we have decided to give peace a chance and see how it is implemented.\n\n\u201cGovernment has issued a circular and we will abide by it for now but where the government listens to any agitation and increases by one kobo, which must be given to us too. Where government wish to take our high level of understanding for granted, we will certainly tell them that it is not weakness,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, warned that any attempt to favour one union against the other would be resisted.\n\nThe Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and its subunit, the National Association Resident Doctors (NARD) had earlier expressed reservations over the new increment in hazard allowance ranging from N5000 to N15,000, N32,000 and N34, 000 for various categories of health workers.\n\nThe two bodies had said that what the federal government did was not in line with the terms of collective bargaining which they all surrendered to during negotiations.\n\nHe also called for a balance in the leadership of the Health Ministry, saying this would benefit the country.\n\nOn the issue of adjustment of CONHESS salary structure, Josiah warned that the unions would not guarantee industrial harmony in the health sector if the president fails to include the adjusted salary structure.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting that Mr. President will do us well because as a union we have yielded to his request that we should keep the health sector strike free for the period. We have done our part, we expect that no matter the games that the Federal Ministry of Health is playing by trying to deny us our own right, the president has the power to direct that the committee\u2019s job should be included in the budget before he signs it.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to call on Nigerians to plead on our behalf because we have been very patient, we have been very patriotic and we will not want a situation where all the effort we have put to ensure that there is peace in the health sector to waste because if it is not put into the budget, next year \u2013 a few days from now, which when we go into next year, certainly, the health sector will not be as peaceful as we have tried to keep it.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t put the adjusted CONHESS into the budget then they should be ready for us,\u201d the JOHESU leader said.\n\nJosiah further said that the unions were aware that there was a provision of N80 billion made to take care of the salary adjustment for health workers.\n\nHe said it would be wrong for the Federal Ministry of Health to \u201cdivert\u201d the funds for other purposes.\n\n\u201cAt the peak of our agitation the office of the Chief of Staff to the President also intervened. We are aware that there was a provision of N80 billion made to take care of adjustment of salaries. It is our strong belief that even if they have not specifically stated that this amount is for CONHESS adjustment, I think there is a provision made already.\n\n\u201cOur money from what the committee has worked out is not beyond that N80 billion so for the president who appealed to us and who we have also listened to, we have kept our deal; we have kept our gunpowder dry. We have not shot anyone so the president should do us that favour by giving us that level of love that we have shown.\n\n\u201cWe believe that there is provision already imputed in the budget but the federal ministry of health in its well \u2013 celebrated bias would want to say the money is not meant for us so that they can favour those who they want to favour,\u201d he said.\n\nJosiah added: \u201cIf any government wants a proper health system, a developed health system in this country we should change from this leadership where they put medical doctors at the helm of affair. Let us go back to what took us to be among the best in the commonwealth. Hospitals\u2019 administrators should take charge so that there will be fairness and neutrality in handling hospital affairs for all professional groups.\n\n\u201cToday, a matter that ought to have been handled by the HR in the federal Ministry of Health it is the Directorate of Hospital Services that is handling it and that is headed by medical doctors that is why there is huge bias being displayed every now and then and that is why since 1985 the health system has dropped from its high point down to where we are and if we must talk about international best practices then we must rejig the leadership.\n\n\u201cRight from the beginning of this administration we asked that the three top personnel should not come from one profession. The minister and minister of state should not come from one profession and the permanent secretary. For now that has not been heeded and the country is suffering for that,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "GetEquity is changing startup investment in Africa. But how?",
          "text": "GetEquity, a Nigeria-based investment platform, came into the market with the mantra of \u201cchallenging the status quo of startup financing and venture capital\u201d in Africa. The company says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nLooking back at its activities, that mantra doesn\u2019t seem like a mere marketing play, the startup is indeed walking the talk. But how is it doing that?\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July this year, GetEquity is a product of a series of iterations. Initially, the co-founders didn\u2019t set out to democratise startup investment in Africa. In fact, Dike and Okafor, who are blockchain engineers, were building a blockchain exchange platform, and Temitope was working around a big data analytics product. But, on getting into the Mozilla Accelerator, the trio realised that they could \u201cmerge forces\u201d and build one of the most innovative products in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cI met Temitope at the Mozilla Accelerator after we\u2019d bantered on Twitter for the longest time. I and William are technical persons and Temitope is a business operator, so I asked Temitope to help us figure out the business side of our product and we\u2019d help him build a technical team for his product,\u201d said Dike, CEO at GetEquity. Apparently, this was the supposed skill trade that would lead to the founding of GetEquity.\n\nThis is how disruption looks like\n\nTake a look at this: Shola, 25, wants to invest in a high-growth startup but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and when he finally finds some answers, his cheque is not enough to be an LP or even get him into an angel syndicate. So, he gives up. On the other side of things, Ada, a young founder, is struggling to raise enough capital to keep her startup running. So, she shuts down the business.\n\nBut what if Ada could find 10, 20, 100, or even more, of Shola who only have maybe $100 or less to invest? She could have raised close to what she needed to keep her business alive. This simple thinking led to building GetEquity.\n\nAcross the world, investing in early-stage businesses is not usually a public affair; it is mostly available to capital institutions, top-tier individual angel investors, syndicates (a group of angel investors), and sometimes, family and friends. Though this is still largely the case, startups like GetEquity are making a decent effort to disrupt this privileged arrangement and open up the space to any interested party.\n\nOn GetEquity, startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Herconomy, a fintech startup for women, closed a $100,000 pre-seed funding round within 24 hours on the platform. That\u2019s 20% of the total funding raised and the portion reserved for its community. Before now, the possibility of a Nigerian startup closing a funding round\u2014both the seeds and the series\u2014within 24 hours was not only a tall order but a fantasy.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Fluidcoins, TalentQL and Mizala have closed $30,000, $25,000, and $25,000, respectively, from users who weren\u2019t necessarily part of their communities.\n\nTo clear the misconception that GetEquity was built on blockchain technology, the CEO said their technology only employs the core blockchain concept, which is tokenisation. \u201cBlockchain is all about ownership, accessibility and security, and we have borrowed this core concept to tokenise funding on our platform,\u201d Dike said.\n\nThis means, when a company wants to raise $50,000, it\u2019s technically selling 5,000 tokens at $10 per one.\n\nDue diligence and investment security\n\nOne of the most important and heaviest stages of investment is due diligence (DD); it\u2019s at this point the worthiness of a company is being tested. A lot of checks and notes comparisons happen at this stage. The question now is if investors can\u2019t carry out DD individually, how do they then know that a business is worth investing in?\n\nApparently, GetEquity operates like every other VC: its team of diverse backgrounds\u2014law, marketing, investment, business development\u2014analyse the potential growth of a startup before onboarding them on their platform. If that\u2019s the case, one can chose to question the validity of the disruption the company promises to bring into startup investment. Isn\u2019t this just a digital VC? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. GetEquity\u2019s DD process is reportedly fast and doesn\u2019t hold startup to ridiculous equity shares, unlike most conventional VCs.\n\n\u201cWe look through the entire business\u2014the model, product roadmap, founder(s), traction, and revenue. We ensure the business is solid before we enlist them on our platform,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of growth Ekundayo, who doubles as joint CEO at Printivo.\n\nHowever, Ekundayo mentioned that even though the company\u2019s approach to DD is thorough, the company can\u2019t guarantee investors ROI on all their investments. And that\u2019s why GetEquity accepts investments as low as $10; this way investors can minimise risk by putting in small money across a number of startups.\n\nGrowth and Traction\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 GetEquity raised in April this year, it also raised an undisclosed six-figures pre-seed from Green House Capital, a renowned fintech investment shop based in Nigeria, and this validates the potential of its products. Since the investment, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nGetEquity has released a couple of features that make investing on its platform even better; it launches secondaries where users can sell off their equity (token) according to its present value. For instance, if a user wishes to sell their token after buying and keeping for a while, all they need to do is indicate their interest to sell and they will be matched with a buyer, and vice versa.\n\nThe startup also recently just released Dealroom, a feature that allows users, mostly syndicates, to privately raise money faster. Think of a private room where you can quickly meet with your family and then convince them to commit to a course, but here, the course is raising money.\n\nGetEquity has a wallet infrastructure that users can use to hold value until ready to invest in their chosen startup. It charges between 0.5-5% on every transaction, depending on the payment option chosen. There\u2019s also an option to fund a wallet with crypto for those living where crypto dealings aren\u2019t frowned at, thanks to its partnership with Fluidcoin, another startup that has raised on its platform. The company also charges startups 4% commission on transaction.\n\nBoth local and international investors are bullish on Africa, especially Nigeria, which recorded the largest funding of about $1.4 billion out of almost $5 billion funding raised by African startups in 2021. With a more inclusive funding infrastructure built by GetEquity, this trend promises to continue for Nigeria come 2022.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lighting address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lighting developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "West African e-commerce platforms take local fashion makers global",
          "text": "\u201cI\u2019ve always loved and wanted to wear African prints more here,\u201d says Bami Adenike, expressing her enduring fondness for African wear despite staying close to alluring luxury boutiques in Paris. Adenike, a 28-year-old Nigerian artist, moved to France in 2016 and has mostly bought clothes from French fashion retail stores since relocating due to the prohibitive costs of having custom-made African dresses shipped to Europe.\n\nBy late 2020, when Adenike wanted to update her closet, she discovered a number of online platforms offering to deliver African apparel to Europe, at affordable rates, and took a chance ordering through Fashtracker, a marketplace that connects more than 40 African designers with local and international consumers. Within two weeks, her prints were delivered to her door in Paris by DHL.\n\n\u201cI have to admit I was shocked the dresses were well fitted. I used to spend hours looking through Ankara images on Pinterest without any idea how to get them,\u201d she told TechCabal on a phone call. \u201cNow, it\u2019s become a norm for me to patronise brands from Nigeria and sometimes other West African countries.\u201d\n\nAfrican fashion has in recent times attracted significant media interest from the Global North, partly fueled by megastars\u2014such as Naomi Campbell, Alicia Keys, and Beyonc\u00e9\u2014who occasionally rock clothes designed on the continent. Last year, the latter, a 28-time Grammy award winner, was spotted wearing a patterned dress and wide-leg pants made by Tongoro, a Senegalese brand owned by designer Sarah Diouf.\n\nWhile entertainment celebrities have had a hand in propelling African designers to international fame, Africans in the diaspora like Adenike are the biggest consumers of clothes exported from the continent, with e-commerce platforms\u2014such as Nigeria-based Fashtracker and Ivorian site Afrikrea\u2014playing middlemen.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe African Union Commission defines the African Diaspora as \u201cpeoples of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union\u201d. Globally, this group is spread out across several continents. An estimated 36 million Africans live outside the country of their birth, with just over 50% resident within the continent. The sheer size of the African Diaspora means there\u2019s a large potential market for African fashion collections outside the continent.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal for this article, Fashtracker founder and CEO Wunmi Akinsola revealed the platform was originally built to serve markets in Africa. But that changed when the team realised more traction was coming from outside the continent than within. \u201cI was only running ads for Nigeria and neighbouring countries, and yet about half of my customers came from other parts of the world. So, it became obvious that there\u2019s a massive market out there,\u201d Akinsola said.\n\nMoulaye Tabour\u00e9, the founder of Afrikrea, grew up in Mali but has lived and worked in several countries. While in Paris, he discovered that the Africans he came across abroad were mostly interested in African fashion items but could not readily access them. That inspired the founding of his online marketplace in 2016 with the ambition to export African culture globally.\n\n\u201cA few months after we launched and had some designers, our close ones noticed we were wearing more African products and got more interested,\u201d Tabour\u00e9 recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cAfrikrea led us to consume more from African businesses, not by solidarity or charity, but out of pure interest.\u201d\n\nThis year, Afrikrea\u2019s community of merchants has carried out almost \u20ac8 million worth of transactions, according to the company\u2019s data, with over 80% of its orders coming from outside the continent\u201440% from Europe and 30% from the US. It claims to record more than 500,000 site visits monthly.\n\nDespite facing stiff competition from several other similar platforms, Tabour\u00e9 believes product diversity has helped Afrikrea grow rapidly, considering the African Diaspora isn\u2019t a monolithic group. \u201cThe black diaspora is the largest in the world and also probably the most heterogeneous. So having a wide array of sellers, products, and experiences to cater to everyone has always been key to our success,\u201d he said.\n\nAfrikrea and its counterparts are increasingly attracting African designers and micro-businesses along the fashion and art value chains that wish to gain awareness among customers outside the continent. Within five years, Afrikrea grew its seller base from 500 to 10,000 across 47 African countries and currently allows them to showcase and sell African-inspired clothing and accessories to 170 countries around the world.\n\nEssentially, these platforms provide a gateway to reach global consumers demanding African fashion collections and handle all the resource-intensive components, including marketing, cross-border shipping, and payments, which would otherwise hinder local fashion designers and dealers from selling outside their national borders.\n\n\u201cAfter launching on Instagram and boosting our post, we started getting a lot of inquiries from people abroad about purchasing items. But there was no way to get things to them effectively,\u201d says John Pelumi Oyedokun, founder and creative director of Mode Vert Limited, a Nigerian company behind fashion label Jon Pelumi, which launched in 2019. Oyedokun then partnered with Fashtracker after Akinsola reached out to him. \u201cAfter signing up [on Fashtracker], we\u2019re able to sell our products to a growing customer base in Ghana, the US, and Canada.\u201d\n\nFor Olakunmi Oni, Lagos-based fashion designer and the founder of minimalist women\u2019s clothing line, 1964 Brand, selling online and shipping abroad was never a problem but admits that listing her brand products on Fashtracker \u201cshows our designs to a much wider audience.\u201d\n\nTypically, designers selling on e-commerce sites can create storefronts and receive payments from anywhere in the world. Once a purchase is made, the platform deducts a commission of 10-15% per sale. For the logistics side of things, Afrikrea, for instance, has a partnership with DHL that allows micro-retailers selling via its platform to ship to their customers for as low as $20 per package. The company also recently launched ANKA, a SaaS e-commerce solution for African fashion designers and merchants, offering a single dashboard to manage multiple sales channels, inventory, and payments.\n\nAnkara dresses are now popular among Africans and non-Africans in Europe and North America, thanks to e-commerce. Photo credit: Umaizi\n\nWhether curators like Afrikrea or single-brand sites such as Ghana\u2019s KIKI Clothing, platforms for African fashion tap into a growing global demand for African designer goods, riding on e-commerce. Africa\u2019s e-commerce opportunity is estimated to be $19.8 billion by Statista, and in terms of general e-commerce activities on the continent, McKinsey & Company estimates consumer spending to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025.\n\nThat presents an opportunity for local retailers to promote African fashion globally, especially with consumers increasingly switching to online shopping amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic. For designers, partnerships with e-commerce platforms transform their otherwise small tailor businesses into fashion brands with global patronage while opening up the $31 billion sub-Saharan Africa clothing market to the rest of the world.\n\nBut scaling globally isn\u2019t without its own challenges. Custom officers mostly within the continent still pose a major constraint to cross-border shipment, especially in the absence of an effective free trade agreement. \u201cInitiatives like the AfCFTA are there but yet to become concrete realities,\u201d Tabour\u00e9 said. He adds that African governments can do more by facilitating customs for people shipping outside of the continent, particularly to Europe. \u201cWe want to take African culture to you wherever you are. Our job is mainly to remain optimistic but pragmatic.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days. Not to be a Grinch, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it this year.\n\nMeet the 15 semi-finalists for Pitchstorm 3.0. Find out a little about them.\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Techpoint Africa is a digital media company that amplifies the best innovations out of Africa through its media, data, and events.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "As the world battles a new variant of COVID-19 just a few months after it seemed as though global travel was recovering, the uncertainties around travel are already making people set trends on how they want to travel in the coming year.\n\nTravel and tour companies are keeping a watch on these trends to build and adapt their products, and to help their clients to be prepared for the changing demands from travellers.\n\nThe resurgence of COVID-19 is accentuating the alteration of social and business norms and interactions, while also becoming tiresome.\n\nDaniel Batchelor, vice president, Global Corporate Communications and Social Responsibility, says, \u201cWith vaccines and digital health passports now making the rounds, we can finally begin looking forward to new adventures, both near and far.\u201d\n\nSeyi Adewale, CEO \u2013 Mainstream Cargo Limited, tells BusinessDay that the trend for 2022 will continue to include increase in diplomatic spat because of this resurgence, flight restrictions, forced isolation in government centres, huge levies on Covid related remedial or mitigating actions, cancellation of major global events and limited powers of global institutions to prevail on sovereign states for harmonised Covid approach.\n\nAdewale says the reaction of individuals, families and indeed businesses is to postpone planned travels and send money to loved ones rather than the preferred physical travels as experienced in the now resolved UK-Nigeria red listing \u2018brawl.\u2019 This has discouraged many travellers both ways.\n\nDespite these obvious realities, here are key travel trends that will shape travel in year 2022:\n\nReduction in business travel\n\nThere are indications that business trips will be reduced as countries may increase the cost of tourists in a bid to cushion the effect of losses incurred from reduced business trips.\n\nRead also: Omicron: Nigerian travellers lament over treatment by Ghanaian government\n\nAccording to Adewale, for businesses, online meetings and conferences appear to now be the norm as so many consulates worldwide are operating below capacity in order to tame the Covid spread, and this has hampered travellers who now have to wait several months beyond the ordinary for travel visas.\n\nShort-haul destinations\n\nCOVID-19 has made many people keen to travel within the country or to short-haul destinations. If there is any chance of a global lockdown, they would not be stuck far from home. Besides, travel restrictions, including testing requirements and quarantine, are also forcing people to opt for domestic travel or within the same region.\n\nPrashant Pitti, co-founder, EaseMyTrip, says his company found that people are making the most of long weekends where bookings are up by nearly 60 percent, such as during Dasara.\n\nKojo Bentum-Williams, UNWTO senior expert on communications, says, \u201cWe are effectively providing a focused and thematic tourism development agenda for building strong domestic tourism economies, health, online and offline safety and security, sustainability thinking, and talent development in the tourism industry and the AfCFTA.\n\nTravel by chartered planes\n\nAnother noticeable feature is that the demand for travelling by chartered planes is also on the rise. Sachit Wadhwa, co-founder, BookMyCharters, says his company has seen a rise in inquiries now compared to pre-Covid times, pointing out that wedding charters are also in demand, especially between November and March.\n\n\u201cIndeed, government activities such as the recently concluded IATF Conference in South Africa needed the intervention of states to fast track visa issuance, charter private jets (flights) to convey delegates to this event as an example and growing trends that was also experienced during the Arise Fashion Event in Dubai,\u201d Adewale explains.\n\nDomestic tourism/travel\n\nThe driving force behind the recovery of the tourism industry and the local economy; domestic tourism is what travel experts believe will be the first step and leading role in 2022 trends in the travel industry.\n\nExploring closer to home is the final piece of the puzzle. With travel bubbles on hold, travelling closer to home is the perfect way to itch that travel bug while having as little impact as possible. Better yet, travellers can get to know their own country a little more and visit those places that they have always wanted to see.\n\nWith outdoor experiences being hot on the trends, a traveller taking their own car adds to the experience with the chance to really immerse themselves in nature, maybe even camping too.",

          "title": "NIGERIA IN 2022: Five high-yield investment strategies in 2022",
          "text": "As the real return on investment across many Nigerian instruments remained in the negative following a high inflation rate that exceeded yields on many asset classes, there is a need for investors to explore some strategies to reap from the opportunities that may arise in 2022, findings by Businessday have shown.\n\nAfter hitting more than 17 months-high at 9.75 percent on May 14, 2021, yields on the less-risky Federal Government Treasury Bills (T-Bills) dropped to 5 percent on December 15, the lowest in 10 months.\n\nThe performance of T-bills in the review period was similar to other instruments. Investors expect T-Bills rates to plunge further in the first quarter of 2022 before picking up in the second quarter of next year.\n\nFollowing the failed attempts in 2021 to get high returns from the risk-free government instruments and other investments, fixed income investors redirected some of their funds to the more attractive banks\u2019 placement and commercial paper (CP), according to BusinessDay findings.\n\nCiting where investors were redirecting their investment, Ayo Ebo, Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham said \u201ca lot of corporates have been issuing commercial paper at attractive rates.\u201d This is coupled with \u201cplacement with banks that also comes at an attractive return.\n\nFrom a total asset under management at N1.49 trillion at the beginning of 2021, the Nigerian mutual fund industry shed N220.18 billion to record N1.27 trillion as of December 10, 2021, as analysed from the data by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nMoney market and bond funds took the front seat among peers that recorded a decline in their net asset value (NAV) in the review period. Both funds shade N702.77 billion and N220.11 billion, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Mixed/balanced and Equity-based funds led other mutual fund asset classes as their net asset value increased by N514.15 billion and N241.80 billion, respectively.\n\nRead also: Google\u2019s first investment from African fund goes to transport startup, SafeBoda\n\nInvestment analysts at financial advisory firm, Afrinvest expect that next year a mix of fundamental and market sentiment will drive market activities across regions of the world, markets, and even asset classes.\n\n\u201cWe think the investment landscape is going to be driven by both fundamentals especially coming from the recovery that we have seen in 2021 from the dip of 2020,\u201d Robert Omotunde, chief investment officer, Afrinvest, said.\n\nLooking at the key themes that are likely to shape the investment landscape for 2022, Afrinvest identified the following investment pointers that can guide investors towards an appropriate investment strategy next year.\n\nCautious optimism\n\nIn the euphoria of economic recovery, investment analysts at Afrinvest advise investors to be cautious in their optimism in order not to be caught off guard.\n\n\u201cWe expect investors to be guided by both fundamental and market sentiment.\u201d\n\nMarket timing\n\nTiming and accuracy, according to the Lagos-based financial advisory firm are the two factors that differentiate great investors from informed investors.\n\nThe firm advised that in 2022, it will be better to identify and position investors\u2019 portfolios to benefit from market movement.\n\n\u201cOne of the key things that will differentiate great investors in 2022 is the fact that they can time the market,\u201d it said.\n\nBecause of the fear of different variants of the pandemic, Afrinvest said there will be periods that will present opportunities to buy cheap and it thinks \u201cinvestors can take advantage of this\u201d and so \u201cmarket timing is going to be very crucial as part of the overall theme for investment strategy in 2022.\u201d\n\nStaying liquid\n\nStaying liquid was highlighted as the third strategy for 2022 because the market could present a pocket of opportunities in the year ahead and so \u201ccash is king\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe also like to emphasize the need to stay liquid as much as possible,\u201d Omotunde said.\n\nLooking at the model portfolio of Afrinvest for 2022, it showed that it allocated up to 70 percent of its clients\u2019 investment in liquid assets because they believe investors need the flexibility to be able to move in and out of the assets and to take advantage of different opportunities that will arise.\n\nDiversification\n\nIn a time of economic recovery, Afrinvest said it expects investors to diversify across and within assets to minimize risks and improve returns. As a result, it highlighted that diversification remains a key theme of its 2022 strategy.\n\n\u201cDiversification is key within the traditional and alternative assets and even within the specific asset class; there is still can be diversification across corporate, sovereign and even across and within maturities.\u201d\n\nPortfolio rotation\n\nAccording to the advisory firm, 2022 is expected to be a year of policy normalization across the world, as a result, Afrinvest said it believes that investors should rotate from long-term assets to short/mid dated assets as the former is more vulnerable in such period.\n\nBecause of the outlook on the interest rate and the stability that it expects from the overall economy both locally and globally, Afrinvest projects that portfolio rotation will be a very good investment strategy next year from short to long term duration instrument across different asset classes.",

          "text": "Since its official expansion into Nigeria\u2019s film industry in 2020, Netflix, an American subscription streaming service and production company, has dominated Nigeria\u2019s relatively new video-on-demand market.\n\nNetflix, a service for streaming movies and TV shows, has now become one of the world\u2019s leading online entertainment platforms. Today, Netflix has over 151 million paying subscribers in more than 190 countries.\n\nBusinessDay examines the top ten best movies available on the streaming service. Some of the films were released in previous years, but they made their platform debut on Netflix in 2021.\n\nWe note here that some of the movies on this list were released on Netflix before the date of the first weekly rankings so for this list, we ranked the movies based on high acclaims by a broad cross-section of the best critic websites and social pages, and the number of times these movies have appeared on the top ten ranking on the Netflix top 10 website.\n\nHere are the 10 most rated Nigerian movies on Netflix in 2021\n\n1. Omo Ghetto: The saga\n\nOmo Ghetto: The Saga debuted on Netflix, on 10 September 2021 after getting its theatrical release back in 2020. The two-hour-long movie broke records in the Nollywood entertainment industry in Nigeria and we can totally understand why.\n\nDirected by Funke Akindele and JJC Skillz, this movie serves as a sequel to the 2010 Omo Ghetto. The movie depicts elements of sisterhood, love and takes us on a laughter ride right from the first scene of the police officer chasing a kid through the streets.\n\nThe movie was on the top 10 most viewed movies for 10 consecutive weeks which is testament to its theatrical success of being the highest-grossing Nollywood film with over N635 million.\n\nThe movie stars Funke Akindele-Bello in a dual role as Lefty and Ayomide, who are twin sisters living polar opposite lifestyles. On one hand, Ayomide is peaceful and sophisticated in her ways, on the other we find Lefty being brash and thug-life in her endeavors.\n\nAlongside Lefty, we have actors Eniola Badmus as Busty, Chioma Akpotha as Chummy Choko, and Bimbo Thomas as Nikky playing the roles of Lefty\u2019s friends who always seem to find their way into troublesome situations. Another central character who plays a role in evolving the movie from a comedy to a drama is Femi Stone played by Deyemi Okanlawon, who is our brutal protagonist Lefty\u2019s love interest.\n\n2. King of Boys \u2013 The return of the king\n\nAfter much anticipation, the highly-anticipated King of Boys: The Return of the King, was released on Friday, August 27, 2021.\n\nThe film, produced and directed by Kemi Adetiba starred Sola Sobowale as the lead character and antagonist and created a lot of buzz on social media with Sobowale featuring in a number of snippets and social media influencers doing skits mimicking her \u201cwelcome to the new dispensation\u201d.\n\nKnown as Eniola Salami in the film, Sobowale is a very powerful and influential political figure in the film, using all that is at her disposal to eliminate her enemies. In the first film released on October 20, 2018, she was arrested and jailed but was able to escape and leave the country.\n\nThe second installment sees her back in Lagos to continue realizing her political ambitions which involve using a lot of dark powers, making her known as \u2018Laburu\u2019, meaning evil in Yoruba. The movie was on the top 10 most viewed movies for 7 consecutive weeks on the top 10 website.\n\n3. Namaste Wahala\n\nNamaste Wahala which translates to Hello Trouble is a 2020 Nigerian cross-cultural romantic comedy film produced, written, and directed by Hamisha Daryani Ahuja on her directorial debut. The film stars Ini Dima-Okojie and Ruslaan Mumtaz in the lead roles.\n\nThis film was hailed as the first major collaboration between Bollywood and Nollywood which are two of the biggest film industries in the world. The film is based on the romantic relationship between an Indian boy and a Nigerian girl despite coming from completely different backgrounds and cultures.\n\nIt had a limited theatrical release in Nigeria on 1 December 2020 and opened to positive reviews from critics. The film was globally streamed via Netflix on 14 February 2021 coinciding with Valentine\u2019s Day and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n4. This lady called life\n\nThis Lady Called Life is a 2020 Nigerian romance drama written by Toluwani Obayan and directed by Kayode Kasum. The film stars Lota Chukwu, Bisola Aiyeola, and Wale Ojo in the lead roles.\n\nThe 120 minutes movie sees Aiye (Bisola Aiyeola) who is a young single mother struggling to cope with the rising cost of living in the modern city of Lagos. She works extremely hard running a modest business that barely supports her to have a decent but not a luxury standard of living as She seeks to become a renowned chef as she was abandoned by her own family.\n\nThe film had its theatrical release on 9 October 2020 but the success of the movie spilled into 2021 when released on Netflix with top weekly views in its Netflix debut and received extremely positive reviews from critics.\n\nThe film is rated as one of the best Nigerian films of 2020 and has won Best Of Nollywood Awards categories such as Movie with the Best Screenplay, Best use of Nigerian Food, Movie with the best production design, and movie with the best editing. It\u2019s also nominated for the 2021 Africa Movie Academy Awards Best Soundtrack\n\n5. A Naija Christmas\n\nA Naija Christmas is a 2021 Nigerian Christmas film that was positively received for its good acting directed by Kunle Afolayan and starring Abayomi Alvin, Kunle Remi, Efa Iwara, and the late Rachel Oniga who passed away weeks before the film was released on Netflix on December 16, 2021. It is the first Nigerian Christmas film on Netflix.\n\nA Naija Christmas tells the story of an aging mother who is distraught because her sons have refused to get married and give her grandchildren. She challenges them by offering the first son to marry to get her Ikoyi house as his inheritance.\n\nIn a review for The New York Times, Lisa Kennedy wrote \u201cWith naughty nods made nice by a few twists, \u201cA Naija Christmas\u201d might seem to be an entertaining albeit middle-of-the-road holiday romantic comedy. Only that road cuts through Lagos, Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRead also: Ten Nigerian music albums that made waves in 2021\n\n6. Gone\n\nMade in 2018 and recently acquired by Netflix, screened at Calgary Black Film Festival and select Nigerian cinemas in 2021, one can tell that, beyond being well-written, it\u2019s also a technically efficient film.\n\nThe story follows Ani, played by Sam Dede, who left his family for twenty-five years and returns to lay claim to them, however tenuous that possibility might be. The film caters to that perpetual greener pastures dream all Nigerians crave, and the consequences that occur if that dream should go awry. Ani returns to Nigeria to find the wife he abandoned with another man, and his children all grown into adulthood.\n\nGabriel Afolayan plays the little brother and Bimbo Ademoye plays the big sister which is a new iteration in her streak of impressive performances like starring in Nneka the pretty serpent and featuring in the 2019s sugar rush.\n\n7. One Lagos Night\n\nOne Lagos Night is a 2021 Nigerian crime comedy film set in Lagos. It was directed and produced by Ekene Som Mekwunye.

Oloibiri\n\nWhen Oloibiri was released in 2015 to the cinemas, it got the attention of the relevant governmental authorities for its depiction of the plight of Niger-Deltans abandoned by the government and oil multinationals.\n\nThe movie is set to get the world-wide attention it deserves as the heart-thumping movie hits the film streaming site, Netflix. An action thriller film directed by Curtis Graham, produced by Rogers Ofime and it stars Nollywood legends such as Olu Jacobs, Taiwo Ajai-Lycett, and Richard Mofe Damijo.\n\nRated 16, Oloibiri is based on true-life events, with the motive to drive change. After three decades of neglect, the current administration has approved the takeoff of the Oloibiri Museum and Research Centre to look into the challenges plaguing the community where crude oil was first discovered in commercial quantities in Nigeria.\n\nNominated for 6 categories in the 2017 Best Nollywood Awards, the movie won Best Production Design that year.\n\n9. Fine wine\n\nFine Wine is a 2021 Nigerian romantic comedy film directed by Nigerian American filmmaker Seyi Babatope and written by Temitope Akinbode and Diche Enunwa.

The 120 minutes film grossed a total of N20 million at the box office.\n\nA reviewer for Afrocritik scored the movie 5.9/10 saying \u201cThe major problem with Kambili is that half the time, it seems to forget it is a rom-com\u2026Not only is the movie longer than it needs to be, but the time and effort dedicated to brewing the romance between Kambili and her eventual love interest are also grossly inadequate.\u201d\n\nThough it had mixed reviews from critics and movie fans it held up as one the most viewed movies on Netflix staying at the top 10 for 4 consecutive weeks.\n\nOther honorable mentions include Rattlesnake: the Ahanna story, Tanwa Savage, and Kunle Afolayan\u2019s Swallow.",

We will sit together and decide what we want in Edo.\n\n\u201cI will not negotiate behind you or on your behalf. We will do it together as we are good enough to govern Nigeria. Our target in e-registration is one million and we have over 220,000 members and the more people we can register, the more impact we will have in the election.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended leaders of the PDP across the 18 local government areas of the state for their role in the harmonisation of the old and new structure of the party, noting, \u201cWe have harmonised the party in the state. PDP is the ruling party in Edo State and will continue to be, as some people find it difficult to believe. The party is large enough to accommodate everybody as our umbrella is big enough for all.\n\n\u201cWe have a strong party united at the base as the harmonization was done from the ward level. People will come and go, but the institution will remain.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cLooking into the future, we must open up the party, bring youths into the party as well as more women to participate in the party\u2019s activities. Edo people are one and united as they don\u2019t want division in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is only the people that can give you political power; no one outside Edo State can do that. Anyone hoping for people from outside the state to give them political power is mistaking. The politics of the future should be structured to benefit not only ourselves but our people. Let\u2019s be strategic in our politics.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cObaseki is not Edo. I will come and go, but Edo will remain. We should not personalize politics. We don\u2019t talk or praise ourselves. We don\u2019t commission projects but our people do it for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am working with some agencies to conduct a census and at the end, we will give identification to our people as we can\u2019t wait for the federal government.\u201d\n\nIn his address, the Chairman of the Edo State Chapter of the PDP, Anthony Aziegbemi hailed the governor for organising the party.\n\n...",

The federal and state governments have taken stiffer actions against gender-based violence.

We should extend a hand of fellowship, extend happiness to those who are not fortunate as us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why we are going round to do as much as we can to physically visit orphanages and people who have challenges, at this time of the year.

In the spirit of the Yuletide, they deserve to have a feel of it just like every other child\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further, Mr. Otueroro said \u201cWe are doing this to promote inclusiveness because every child matters and deserves equal right to access the world irrespective of their birth conditions\u201d.\n\nHe also called for more supports for people with disabilities \u201d I want to use this opportunity to solicit more supports from the public and stakeholders for children with special needs because really these people, their families and caregivers need the supports to alleviate the suffering they go through\u201d.\n\nThe Chairman of the occasion, Mr. Kingsley Oromonsele hailed the foundation for putting smiles on the faces of the physically challenged in the state. According to him \u201d every 24th of December, we look forward to this party. This is because for the past nine years, this foundation has not failed to lavish Christmas party on children with disabilities. COF has indeed demonstrated love for special children and I wish to thank the Foundation on behalf of many children with special needs here today\u201d\n\nMr. Oromonsele however called on Edo Government to urgently domesticate the Discrimination Against Persons With Disabilities (Prohibition) Acts 2018 which was passed by Federal Government in 2019 to protect the physically challenged persons in the state.\n\n\u201cWe see Edo state government as our father and Disability Act as our last hope. Currently the discrimination physically challenged persons face is too much; in education, health, employment and even housing, they are too many to mention. But much of these challenges have been addressed in the Act that once domesticated in Edo State, will bring relief to us\u201d.\n\nAlso, the matron of COF and a former Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues in Edo State, Hon.

          "title": "Obasanjo to Clark: Oil in Niger Delta belongs to Nigeria, imagine what would have happened to your people if Igbo won Biafra war",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has responded to an open letter to him by leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Chief Edwin Clark accusing him of hating the people of the Niger Delta region, noting that he had never shown anger or distraught to the Niger Delta region or any part of the country.\n\nClark had in the open letter last week, berated Obasanjo for his position at a peace and security parley convened by the Global Peace Foundation and Vision Africa in Abuja, during which he attacked the National Secretary of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Ebipamowei Wodu, and insisted that the oil in the Niger Delta region belongs to entire country.\n\nClark argued that Obasanjo\u2019s comments that the oil found in the Niger Delta does not belong to the people of the region represents his continuous arrogant stance and disposition against Niger Delta.\n\nHowever, Obasanjo in his own response in an open letter to Clark dated December 28, while denying hating on the people Niger Delta, maintained that the oil resources in the region belongs to the entire federation as a matter of the constitution.\n\nObasanjo said, \u201cLet me proceed with the most basic constitutional fact that you cannot have two sovereign entities within a State which is what your position of Niger Delta ownership claim of the crude oil found in that location amounts to.\n\n\u201cAll those who purchase crude oil from Nigeria enter into contractual relationship with Nigeria not with the Niger Delta. The territory of Nigeria is indivisible inclusive of the resources found therein. No territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved.\n\n\u201cThis is the position of the Nigerian Constitution and international law. If there is a threat of violence to any part of Nigeria today including the Niger Delta, it is the Nigerian military backed by any other machinery that can be procured or established at the Federal level that will respond to any such threat. In principle and practice, the position I have taken on the location of mineral resources in any part of Nigeria is the legal and constitutional position.\u201d\n\nObasanjo who elaborately referred to the Nigeria-Biafra war in the letter, argued that he treated the people of Niger Delta with respect during the war, while suggesting that the people of the region would have had it worse if the Igbo had won the war.\n\nObasanjo continued, \u201cI would be the last person to celebrate the civil war (a tragedy of enormous proportions) Needless to say that the war was fought in order to maintain and secure the territorial integrity of Nigeria to which the Niger Delta is integral, I leave you to second-guess what would have become the fate of the Southern minorities and your ownership claims of the crude oil located in your backyard in the event of a contrary outcome. How do we pay homage to the memory of those who gave their lives to ensure the successful outcome of the civil war including the millions who perished on either side of the war?\u201d he wondered.\n\nThe former Nigerian president claimed that what Clark called an outburst is his way of getting people/listeners\u2019 attention, while suggesting that the Niger Delta leader is only accusing him of what he is guilty of.\n\nRead Obasanjo\u2019s Letter in Full Below:\n\nOlusegun Obasanjo\n\nAgbe Usbe House,\n\nQuarry Road, Ibars 20.\n\nBx 3116, Abeceuta,\n\nOgun State,\n\nNigeria\n\nMY RESPONSE TO THE OPEN LETTER BY CHIEF (DR.) E. K. CLARK\n\nYour letter titled \u201cMy Disappointment Over Unprovoked Outburst Against The People of the Niger Delta Region\u201d came to my attention on my return from the Horn of Africa on Christmas eve. After very careful and close study of your letter, I decided to respond to your letter also openly for general education of all and to clear some misconception and misperception on your part.\n\nFirst, my visit to you on the evening of Monday, December 13, 2021, was both a condolence and get-well-quick visit to you that had nothing to do with Bishop Sunday Onucha meeting which I attended the following day. You should remember that I did not discuss in particular the meeting of the Committee for Goodness of Nigeria, CGN, that was coming the following day except to ask if the papers had been received by you. The brief touch on the state of the nation is the normal discussion on the situation which you rightly described as \u201ccontinues to drift to very disturbing levels that evening. Otunba Oyewols Fasawe. who was with me to your house and to all the four people I visited that night, can testify. You were one of the four people I visited I would have expected my social visit to be excluded from your vituperation on other matters. However, you deserved the visit and that was it.\n\nFor me, personally, I have never shown any anger or distraught with Niger Delta Region nor with any part or Region of Nigeria Rather, I have always picked points on leadership performance or policies and I will continue to do so. Even when a particular part of Nigeria decided not to vote for me and their leaders told me that in clear terms, I showed understanding and not anger or distraught and disabused their minds on what I believed they got wrong. And in subsequent elections, they voted for me. My records before, during and after the civil war in Niger Delta Region was without blemish and it was all goodwill to all the people of Nigeria and especially the people of the Niger Delta Region which was my theatre of operation during the Nigerian civil war\n\nI could not have mentioned to you any grievances against the Niger Delta Region during my social visit because there was never anyone and there cannot be anyone. But if you take my holding a constitutional position on federalism and reiterating the position of our past Constitution 1963 Constitution \u2013 as I understand it as anger or grievance against the Niger Delta Region or Nigeria\u2019s Delta people, that will be a very wrong position to take because until I can be legally and constitutionally persuaded otherwise, I will continue to hold my ground. And it is not a matter of emotion of threat or name-calling which do not throw light on the issue or walkout which does not strengthen any argument or debate.\n\nWhat you call outburst is my own way of calling or attracting attention. I raise my voice or stamp the desk such that those who are sleeping would have to wake up to listen to me. Even in bilateral discussion, I consciously tap the other person to ensure that I am attracting his or her attention. I have had experience that it was when the person I was talking to started snoring that I realised he was not listening to me. But if raising my voice, stamping the desk or tapping is unpleasant to anyone, I tender unreserved apology If I interjected to either complete a statement or to correct a statement being made that I believe was not the true situation, I have no apology for that. Truth must be stated and upheld no matter how bitter it may be.\n\nChief Clark, you are right to say that we have known ourselves since we were both in General Gowon\u2019s administration in 1975. The good thing and maybe the bad one as well is that you haven\u2019t changed much, if at all, since those days and I haven\u2019t changed much either. You stated and displayed what you are characteristically known and noted for- Urhobo or jaw, and what I am characteristically known and noted for. Let me proceed with the most basic constitutional fact that you cannot have two sovereign entities within a State which is what your position of Niger Delta ownership claim of the crude oil found in that location amounts to.\n\nAll those who purchase crude oil from Nigeria enter into contractual relationship with Nigeria not with the Niger Delta. The territory of Nigeria is indivisible inclusive of the resources found therein. No territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved.\n\nThis is the position of the Nigerian Constitution and international law. If there is a threat of violence to any part of Nigeria today including the Niger Delta, it is the Nigerian military backed by any other machinery that can be procured or established at the Federal level that will respond to any such threat. In principle and practice, the position I have taken on the location of mineral resources in any part of Nigeria is the legal and constitutional position.\n\nMay I also recall the adjunct position I proposed that equity and justice demand that those domiciled in these locations are entitled to more of the material benefits accruing from the crude oil or other minerals. At the end of the day, it may transpire that our linguistic differences on this matter are no more than semantics. And we stand on the same logic with respect to the criminal mining of gold deposits in Zamfara State today or any other State in Nigeria or any other part of Nigeria.\n\nSince you have selected the 1953 Constitution as your ideal guide, I will now quote the relevant Section 140 for the Nigerian public to arrive at a more informed and balanced understanding of our discourse \u201cThe 1963 Constitution Section 140, titled Mining Royalties and Rents\u201d, stated thus: (1) There shall be paid by the Federation to each Region a sum equal to fifty per cent of (a) the proceeds of any ROYALTY received by the Federation in respect of any minerals extracted in that Region; and (b) any mining RENTS derived by the Federation during that year from within that Region\u201d.\n\nMy dear Chief, where in this constitutional provision is it said or implied that minerals located in any part of Nigeria belongs to that location? For emphasis and to further buttress the point, the provision is even in the exclusive list -exclusively reserved to the Federal Government!\n\nYou made the unnecessary reference to the appointment of Eng Funsho Kupolokun as the Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, but you conveniently forgot that before Kupolokun, there was Gaius Obaseki and Kupolokun served under Dr. Edmund Daukoru, who was Minister of State for Petroleum.\n\nI would be the last person to celebrate the civil war (a tragedy of enormous proportions) Needless to say that the war was fought in order to maintain and secure the territorial integrity of Nigeria to which the Niger Delta is integral, I leave you to second-guess what would have become the fate of the Southern minorities and your ownership claims of the crude oil located in your backyard in the event of a contrary outcome. How do we pay homage to the memory of those who gave their lives to ensure the successful outcome of the civil war including the millions who perished on either side of the war?\n\nThis is certainly not the best of times for Nigeria and I understand and empathise with your frustrations but we must be guarded and measured in the expressions of such frustrations lest we throw away the baby with the dirty birth water.\n\nIn para 13 of your letter, you made reference to the issue of asset sharing between Midwest Region and Western Region in the days of General Adeyinka Adebayo and General Samuel Ogbemudia to which you are an eyewitness, observer or participant. I would not hold brief for either of the two military men or for the two dissolved Regions; but if this will feature in your consideration today, I really wonder where you are getting to. There may be more than meets the eye.\n\nIn para 15 of your letter, you tried to compare my Ota Farm with minerals under the soil which are exclusive to the Nigerian Authority as I have earlier shown. But even here, these are issues that must be explained that you wittingly or unwittingly skipped. I have a State Certificate of Occupancy. C of O, for my farmland and if any mineral is found under the ground on my farm, Federal Government will ask the State Government to revoke my C of O for overriding public interest. I could claim for development already carried out on my farmland but the Federal Government would issue licence to any company that had been allocated the right to mine the mineral. It would not matter what I grow on my farm and what development I have carried out. Compensation I could get based on assessed development that I had carried out on the farmland.\n\nThe Constitution that affects Niger Delta Region affects Zamfara State where gold is found and if anybody at the Federal level has remised in implementing the Constitution, then that is a different matter. The gold in llesha, Osun State, and the lead in Ebonyi State, all come under the same Law and Constitution. There is no part of Nigeria whose interest is not dear to my heart. And stating in your letter that it is only the interest of the North I continuously hold dear to my heart is that type of buka gossip that, knowing you as I do since 1975, I am not surprised that you echoed.\n\nI have always stood for equity and justice in our Federation and, for me. tribe has to be suppressed for the state to emerge. And until the state emerges, Nigeria will not make the desired progress as tribesmen will always sacrifice state for tribe This has always been my position and it will remain my position until I breathe my last\n\nThere are many important points that you easily or conveniently left out in your letter. When Tin, Columbite in Jos Plateau and Zinc in Abakaliki and Coal in Enugu were discovered in the early 1900s, the ownership was vested in the Colonial Government. Mitigating the hazards suffered by people in any mineral-producing area is legitimate and must be differentiated from the issue of ownership. The mitigation process must go for all and gas, lead, gold, limestone for cement, etc. What developed Nigerian Regions in the colonial days and early post. independence days were cocoa and rubber in the West, groundnut and cotton in the North and oil palm in the East.\n\nYour paras 18-23 are tissues of concoctions and outright distortions and lies which may be due to loss of memory on your part of misrepresentation. Let me illustrate with few examples. On resumption of office as President of Nigeria in 1999, the first meeting I held out of Abuja was a meeting on the Niger Delta Region. Without being prompted. I decided the 13% derivation that the new Constitution granted to oil-producing areas should be paid. If you have evidence of a legal action that forced me to implement it, please produce for me to see or publish it. At the meeting of December 14, 2021 although the recommendation was to go from 13% to 17% to oil-producing areas, Dr. Igali made the case for 15% and we as CGN went up to not less than 18% Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, bill was my initiative for contribution to be made by State Governments, ol companies and Federal Government. The States lobbied the National Assembly to exclude them. They were excluded and what was passed became the law eventually and I implemented it. You seemed to know little to nothing on LNG generally including efforts made to turn Bonny LNG from three trains to seven trains and surely you are not updated on Brass LNG and I will plead with you to be better admitted on it all.\n\nLet me now separate Global Peace Foundation meeting of December 13, 2021 at the instance of Bishop Onuoha and where I participated from the second meeting of CGN which followed on December 14, 2021. We believe that the Conclusion and the Report of the meeting of December 14, 2021 hold the best position for realistic and pragmatic action for taking the country forward as possible actionable amendment to the Constitution before 2023 elections. Every Nigerian has rights under the Constitution. And no one should exercise his right against the right of another Nigerian. Our Report was only recommendations to those who can take action for implementation.\n\nIf at a meeting, singly or collectively with others, you will take action to negate the outcome of another meeting of national interest and importance based on extraneous outcome on issues emanating from another meeting not directly connected with the original first meeting. then how much can anybody take you seriously as a democrat, that\n\nsmirks of a dictatorship to me? Some of the languages you have deployed to describe me in your letter are offensive, uncouth and I totally and completely rejected them. I am not inconsistent, hypocritical, unstatesman and nor am I anybody\u2019s lackey. You use your own yardstick to judge others. I fear God and I respect those who respect themselves and I hope it is about time you change from a tribesman to a statesman of character. That is what Nigeria and indeed the Region you profess to love demand of you at this stage. I believe one lesson that we all must appreciate that we have all learned in the last sixty-one years of our independence is that we all need to be civil to ourselves and occasionally put ourselves in the position of others. Bad language does not show prudence, wisdom and maturity. I hope you will think and adjust. Negotiation achieves better results than dictation. I believe that we should be reformists rather than being pedantic with leave it or take-it attitude Together, I also believe Nigena can be fixed and mended for the benefit of today and tomorrow on the basis of give and take If we all demand what we consider as our rights without yielding and with unbending stature, we will be wrong and record failure at the end of the day. Reform is a continuous exercise but relatively slow in achieving results. Revolution for sea-change may rarely happen and then we may continue to languish in frustration and regret with dire judgement of posterity.\n\nI wish you well and may the Year 2022 be a great year for you personally and for our country, Nigeria.\n\nYours in service of Nigeria\n\nOLUSE\u011eUN OBASANJO\n\nDecember 28, 2021",

          "title": "Opinion: I Stand With Buhari On Withheld Assent To Electoral Amendment Bill, 2021 \u2013 By SUNDAY EZE",
          "text": "The insertion of direct primary election in the Electoral Amendment Act, 2021 as a criterion for nomimation of candidates by political parties was ill conceived. It is a direct affront and infringement on the right of party and party affairs. Our eyes are more than before opened to the power tussle between the political class especially the senators and the governors. Some senators who were governors, those aspiring to be governors and those angling to retain their seats in 2023 understood in clear terms the enormous powers incumbent governors wield on who becomes what. The failed move therefore, was a clever attempt to clip the wings of the governors. It failed flat and the arrow heads of such legislation will pay dearly for it in 2023. Elections in Nigeria are often characterised by massive electoral fraud and open political manipulations. Very hot, contentious and mostly violent. It is akin to a near war situation \u2013 a do-or-die-affair. Only the 1992 presidential election was adjudged to be free, fair and credible. Since the return of democracy in 1999 after long years of military rule, elections are rigged, ballot boxes stuffed, result sheets written in hotels and homes of politicians. Ballot papers are snatched at gunpoints, presiding officers disappear at the behest of the highest bidder or are abducted. Electoral officials are openly bribed to alter results. Security agencies and thugs are deployed to intimidate and kill political opponents. At the end the integrity of the elections is called to question. Therefore, they become very contentious subject of litigation. Candidates who lose elections have challenged the process up to the Supreme Court. Mandates were brazenly stolen and justice was rarely served after the tortuous journey. The return to democracy saw all presidential election results contested except for the 2015 election. Nigeria does not fall under the league of nations known to respect the true tenets of democracy. Free, fair, credible and transparent elections in Nigeria can only be achieved with efficient and effective democratic structures and laws deliberately put in place to drive the democratic process. However, the political class is simply paying lip services to efforts aimed at enacting a law to support free, fair and credible elections.\n\nThe fear of losing elections and political patronage by many unpopular elected officials and ruling class is the only reason why the Electoral Act, 2010 as amended was not assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari. These group of political leaders who have no business in governance have taken undue advantage of the weaknesses of the laws guiding the political system to feather their political nests. In a space of three years; President Muhammadu Buhari had on two occasions withheld his assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill, 2010 as amended. First, in 2018, he declined to assent the bill on account of limited timeframe for implementation. Second, in 2021, the bill was returned to him once again for assent and he declined. The compulsory insertion of direct primary election of candidates aspiring to political offices in the Act was the crux of the matter. The President had within the thirty days window provided by the constitution to assent or decline sought the advices of both the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and that of the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice. While INEC assured of their readiness and having the capacity to monitor direct primaries when invited by political parties; the Attorney General had a different view. In a letter to the National Assembly, dated December 13, 2021, titled \u2018Withholding of assent to Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021,\u2019 Buhari premised his decision on legal, security and economic grounds. While faulting the removal of indirect primaries as contained in Section 87 of the Electoral Act 2010, Buhari among others said the amendment as proposed is first in clear violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choice. Second, direct primary has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering the nation\u2019s peculiarities. Third, conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties. Fourth, the proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of law including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing constitution of the parties already registered with INEC permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. Fifth, it is undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\nOn the heels of the president\u2019s letter to the National Assembly conveying his decision to withhold assent to the draft bill, the public space was awash with lawmakers resolve to override his veto. However, the resolve suffered a huge setback with deft political moves made by governors and other stakeholders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to curtail the numbers of the parliamentarians willing to sign to override the president. Despite media report of over 70 senators throwning their weight behind the move to override Buhari, it failed. Both Chambers will require two-thirds majority to override the president. From the legislative submissiveness to the executive and the number of APC senators who are majority, it is remains to be seen how the opposition PDP could muster the numbers to veto the president\u2019s decision. The governors are unarguably influential when it comes to matters of the state. They have always succeeded in determining where the political pendulum swings. It must be stated that the reason or compelling need to veto the bill was a ploy to water the ground for a compromise and political horse trading which will define every senators fate come 2023. Political pundits were aware of the inherent weaknesses of the legislators when it comes to confronting governors. Therefore in a surprise move, the senate resolved to consult with house of representatives and their constituencies on the matter before taking finite decision. Is it now that constituencies matter? Were constituencies consulted before the public spat? Perhaps, before they are back from recess, the constitutional window to override the president has elapsed. The poor and manipulated electorates should bear in mind that the furore about direct or indirect primaries was not anchored on free, fair and credible general election or an attempt to improve the decayed democratic space but to serve the selfish and personal interests of political leaders within their parties. Perusing through the reasons adduced by the President for withholding his assent, one has no other option than to stand with Buhari in this one.\n\nSunday Onyemaechi Eze, a Media and Communication Specialist, wrote via [email protected] and could be reached on 08060901201\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

That rebellion lasted for 28 years. But one day, the mastermind of that rebellion was taken out and that was the automatic ending of it.\n\n\u201cThose who are behind this insurgency will be taken out.

So, that gives you an understanding of what the government is confronting. Government is confronting severe challenges.\n\n\u201cBut despite those challenges, it is keeping its head above water. It is doing his best for Nigerians. It may not be what they want; it may not be as good as it has ever been in the days of boom for the country, but then government is keeping its head above the waters.\n\n\u201cNigerians are also looking into the purpose of government as to make life better for the people at any given time.

We have done our part; we expect that no matter the games that the Federal Ministry of Health is playing by trying to deny us our own right, the president has the power to direct that the committee\u2019s job should be included in the budget before he signs it.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to call on Nigerians to plead on our behalf because we have been very patient, we have been very patriotic and we will not want a situation where all the efforts we have put to ensure that there is peace in the health sector to waste because if it is not put into the budget, next year \u2013 a few days from now, which when we go into next year, certainly, the health sector will not be as peaceful as we have tried to keep it.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t put the adjusted CONHESS into the budget, then they should be ready for us,\u201d the JOHESU chairman said.\n\nJosiah said the unions were aware of a provision of N80 billion set aside to take care of the salary adjustment for health workers.\n\nHe said it would be wrong for the Federal Ministry of Health to \u201cdivert\u201d the funds for other purposes.\n\nThe union leader said: \u201cAt the peak of our agitation, the office of the chief of staff to the president also intervened. We are aware that there was a provision of N80 billion made to take care of adjustment of salaries. It is our strong belief that even if they have not specifically stated that this amount is for CONHESS adjustment, I think there is a provision made already.\n\n\u201cOur money from what the committee has worked out is not beyond that N80 billion. So, for the president who appealed to us and who we have also listened to, we have kept our deal; we have kept our gunpowder dry, we have not shot anyone, so the president should do us that favour by giving us that level of love that we have shown.\n\n\u201cWe believe that there is provision already imputed in the budget but the federal ministry of health in its well \u2013 celebrated bias would want to say the money is not meant for us so that they can favour those who they want to favour.\u201d\n\nOn the adjustments made to the hazard allowance, Josiah said the unions had accepted the explanation offered by the federal government.\n\nHe, however, warned that any attempt to favour one union against the other would be resisted.\n\nSpeaking on the hazard allowance, he said: \u201cAs for the approval of the hazard allowance, it is not where we wanted to be, but as far as we are concerned, government pleaded that that is what they can afford for now. In as much as we would have loved it to be higher than what we asked for, we have decided to give peace a chance and see how it is implemented.\n\n\u201cGovernment has issued a circular and we will abide by it for now. But where the government listens to any agitation and increases by one kobo, that must be given to us too. Where government wishes to take our high level of understanding for granted, we will certainly tell them it is not weakness.\u201d\n\nHe also called for a balance in the leadership of the Health Ministry, saying this would benefit the country.\n\nJosiah added: \u201cIf any government wants a proper health system, a developed health system in this country we should change from this leadership where they put medical doctors at the helm of affairs. Let us go back to what took us to be among the best in the commonwealth. Hospitals\u2019 administrators should take charge so that there will be fairness and neutrality in handling hospital affairs for all professional groups.\n\n\u201cToday, a matter that ought to have been handled by the HR in the Federal Ministry of Health, it is the Directorate of Hospital Services that is handling it and that is headed by medical doctors. That is why there is huge bias being displayed every now and then and that is why since 1985, the health system has dropped from its high point down to where we are and if we must talk about international best practices then we must rejig the leadership.\n\n\u201cRight from the beginning of this administration, we asked that the three top personnel should not come from one profession. The minister and minister of state should not come from one profession and the permanent secretary. For now that has not been heeded and the country is suffering for that.\n\n\u201cI want to ask again; if the president is hearing me, that he should rejig and any other government that is coming should take this free advice and make the health system work for the masses of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The Kano state government has explained its silence over the controversy trailing the emergence of 18-year-old Shatu Garko, an Hijabian model and indigene of the state who recently emerged Miss Nigerian 2021 at a keenly contested competition in Lagos.\n\nThe government said it was neither aware of her participation nor how the whole event happened.\n\nThe teenager made history penultimate Friday night when she became the first-ever hijab-wearing model to win the Miss Nigeria pageant.\n\nThe 18-year-old horse rider, said to be the youngest contestant this year, came top beating 18 other contestants to emerge as the 44th Miss Nigeria.\n\nThe winner represented North-west zone at the event which held at the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos with Nicole Ikot and Kasarachi Okoro emerging the first and second runners-up respectively.\n\nFor achieving the feat, Ms Garko clinched a N10 million prize, a year residency at a luxury apartment, a brand new car, and other mouth-watering brand ambassadorship opportunities.\n\nThe controversies\n\nHowever, Shatu\u2019s emergence has generated some furore from Kano, her home state as well as reactions from some Islamic scholars.\n\nFor instance, Hisbah, an Islamic group based in Kano, was reported to have summoned the model and her parents for some \u2018questioning.\u2019\n\nHowever, the group said it was only inviting Shatu and her parents to warn them that what she did was not part of Islam.\n\nIn a chat with BBC Pigin, Commander of the Hisbah Board, Sheik Harun Ibn Sina, said the girl\u2019s parents would be invited to let them know that it was un-Islamic for their daughter to partake in any beauty contest.\n\n\u201cWe (Hisbah) have confirmed that Shatu Garko is a Muslim from Kano State and her parents are from Garko Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cKano is a Sharia state and this is why we will not allow the matter to go like that. We will invite the parents to warn them about the actions of their daughter and the fact that what she did was illegal in Islam in case they don\u2019t know so that she will not continue that path and also stop other girls copying her,\u201d Ibn Sina was quoted as saying.\n\nKNSG speaks up\n\nAnd speaking on the development for the first time, Kano state government said it would seek the opinion of competent Islamic authorities and renowned Islamic scholars on how best to go about it.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information, Comrade Muhammad Garba, made the government\u2019s position known during an interview with our correspondent in Kano.\n\nHe said the contestant did not formally inform the state government of her participation in the contest and would not know how the whole thing came about.\n\nAsked whether he would be given a red carpet reception, Muhammad said: \u201cWe only read it on social media about the whole saga. I cannot categorically make the stand of the state government known on whether the pageant would be given a red carpet reception or not anytime she indicates her interest to visit Kano as it is being done by other celebrities who brought honour to the people. As a matter of fact, I am not aware of anything about this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to refer this issue to competent Islamic authorities and renowned Islamic scholars to hear from them and what Islam says about a saga of this magnitude. It is when this is done that we would be able to come up with our final stand on what may have transpired,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nMore controversies\n\nMore reactions have continued to trail Garko\u2019s victory from both Islamic and social points of view.\n\nSome respondents were of the view that it was wrong for a Muslim woman to display her treasure in the full public glare.\n\nIn the view of the scholars, the beauty pageant can\u2019t be seen as a source of pride to the state that is practicing the Sharia legal system, considering the process that led to her emergence as Miss Nigeria 2021.\n\nSpeaking along this line, a renowned Kano Islamic scholar, Ustaz Dauda Lokon Makera said there was no justifiable for any concerned Muslim to hail the Shatu\u2019s victory.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is no reason to celebrate the victory won by the Kano indigene at the just concluded beauty contest on the premise that Islam is a religion of decorum, morality and credibility,\u201d stressing that \u201cin a contest of such magnitude, a woman aspiring to break the record, she is inescapably prone to exposing her nudity.\u201d\n\nThe Muslim cleric further said \u201cthe religion of Islam taught its adherents to be pious in whatever they are doing and avoid anything capable of demeaning their image and morality. The Sharia legal system clearly spells out what Islam preaches on the conduct of every responsible Muslim.\n\n\u201cIt is highly disgusting for one to hear that a Muslim woman from Kano state had won a keenly contested beauty contest involving prominent society ladies. I regretted reading from the social media and some conventional media outfits that a Kano indigene had won the contest.\n\n\u201cBut from the Islamic point of view, it would be wrong for every person to consider the victory a cause for pride and jubilation. It is un-Islamic for a Muslim woman to join any beauty contest.\u201d\n\nViewing it rather differently, a concerned Kano indigene, Alhaji Shittu Sani Marshal, said the controversy around Garko\u2019s victory was needless.\n\nAccording to him, it is the prevailing vogue all over the globe that beauty contest is organised as an advantage given to women by modern civilisation.\n\nHe said there was no reason for Garko\u2019s rejection, insisting she had brought fame and honour to her home state.\n\n\u201cI wonder how the issue of this beauty contest should be blown out of proportion. It is about modern civilisation and one has to contend with the trend of modern realities. Shatu to me deserves a standing ovation in addition to giving her a heroine\u2019s welcome, any time she indicates her interest to visit Kano being her state of origin,\u201d Marshal said.",

          "title": "Shell, ExxonMobil Face Huge Remediation Charges in Nigeria Over Abandoned Offshore Assets",
          "text": "Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria and ExxonMobil are presently faced with huge remediation costs over their failure to properly decommission and cap oil and gas assets across the Niger Delta, especially the ones sold to Nigerians in recent divesture programmes. A situation that creates severe environmental risks and pollution to host communities in the oil-rich Niger Delta.\n\nTHISDAY gathered from stakeholders that the recent case of Aiteo\u2019s Nembe wellhead blowout, brought to the fore the need to enforce the relevant laws and to ensure that the multinationals that sold the assets to the Nigerian companies pay remediation charges.\n\nWhile Aiteo is presently engaged in a legal tussle with Shell, seeking the sum of over $2.5 billion compensation over the sale of Oil Mining Licence 29, THISDAY gathered that the Nigerian oil and gas company is also considering fresh legal action against the multinational over the Nembe spill and other wells not properly capped.\n\nOn the other hand, Seplat Energy Plc last month announced that together with its partner, that it was in competitive discussions to acquire ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian shallow water business. With this, stakeholders have expressed concern about what would happen if the deal is sealed and some of the ExxonMobil\u2019s assets that were not properly capped causes another environment challenge.\n\n\u201cThe present environment challenge is what is likely going to be faced when Shell sells it entire SPDC oil blocs in the Niger Delta without properly capping the oil wells and providing for remediation\u201d an oil and gas expert who pleaded to remain anonymous stated.\n\nFindings by THISDAY have revealed that many of the oil and gas assets sold to Nigerians, mostly by the International Oil Companies (IOCs), are rarely decommissioned or properly abandoned, a development that clearly breaches existing laws regulating the industry.\n\nDecommissioning is the cessation of operations at an oil and gas platform and returning the seafloor to its pre-production state for installations and any relevant structures that have come to the end of their productive life.\n\nOnshore decommissioning involves capping oil wells, clean-up and taking out all production and pipeline risers that are sustained by the platform, removing the platform and getting rid of it in a junk storage area or manufacturing yard.\n\nInternational conventions guiding decommissioning operations include the Geneva Convention on the continental shelf, 1958; United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982; and Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matters, 1972.\n\nBut despite extant regulations and the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), THISDAY learnt that there was rarely any adherence to full decommissioning for the infrastructure that had been sold and there might be no such arrangements for those for which buyers were being sought.\n\nAccording to Section 232, (1) of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), \u201cThe decommissioning and abandonment of petroleum wells, installations, structures, utilities, plants and pipelines for petroleum operations on land and offshore shall be conducted in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice.\u201d\n\nIn Section, 233 (1), the new law affirms, \u201cEach lessee and licensee shall set up, maintain and manage a decommissioning fund held by a financial institution that is not an affiliate of the lessee or licensee, in the form of an escrow account accessible by the commission.\n\n\u201cThe decommissioning and abandonment fund shall exclusively be used to pay for decommissioning and abandonment costs. Where a lessee or a licensee fails to comply with the decommissioning and abandonment plan, the decommissioning and abandonment fund shall be accessed by the commission to pay for the performance by a third party.\u201d\n\nArising from one of the deals, Aiteo recently claimed in a suit that it paid $799 million to Shell for the acquisition of the NCTL pipelines and the assets and that $389.6 million had been lost by the company as a result of the leakages in the pipelines and the degraded conditions of the asset.\n\nAiteo also claimed that $933 million had been expended for the repairs of the pipelines and acquisition of equipment, including well-heads, generators, and pumps, as well as replacement of the flow lines within the NCTL, which it bought from Shell.\n\nIt was learnt that the big oil companies had continued to sell \u201cdead\u201d assets to the country\u2019s local businessmen under the guise that they could no longer cope with militancy or community issues, especially in the Niger Delta.\n\nWhat they have not told buyers is that there would be huge remediation cost down the line from over 30 to 40 years of neglect.\n\nThe recent case of Aiteo\u2019s Nembe wellhead blowout, stakeholders said, brought to the fore the need to enforce the relevant laws and implement proper shutdowns of oil and gas assets in the abandonment and restoration process. Many experts believe that if the wellhead was properly and permanently plugged and decommissioned, since it was not commercially viable, the blowout that happened in Nembe would have been avoided.\n\nIt is believed that Nigeria\u2019s transitory regulatory environment and inability of the authorities to strengthen environmental and petroleum laws for the deactivation of abandoned wells and aging oil facilities have also not helped matters.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the immediate past Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), Nigeria Council, Joe Nwakwue, stated that the availability of regulations had not always been the problem, but enforcement. However, he explained that it was not wholly an IOC issue, noting that there are usually agreements with whoever is buying non-producing assets on steps to take to decommission them.\n\nNwakwue said, \u201cThere are regulations around assets that are no longer in use and it has nothing to do with the transfer of the assets. So, whether it\u2019s Shell or Aiteo, for instance, there are rules.\n\n\u201cWhen a wellhead is no longer producing, there are two steps: it is either there\u2019s a TP&A, which is to temporarily plug and abandon it or you permanently plug and abandon.\n\n\u201cThe problem was that neither of those happened, so that means that it was still theoretically operational. There was need to have abandoned the well when it was no longer in use. That didn\u2019t happen and that\u2019s why we had that spill.\u201d\n\nHe said it did not matter who owned the assets because transfer was a different issue entirely, which should not be mixed up with the decommissioning process.\n\nAccording to Nwakwue, \u201cWhat happened to the commitments? When you talk about asset transfer you\u2019re talking about decommissioning commitment, because when you are selling the assets that\u2019s when the issue of who should decommission will come in because it goes into the pricing.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m buying an asset from you with what is called retirement obligation, I will have to deduct that cost from what I will pay you. I am sure that Shell transferred its commitment to Aiteo.\u201d\n\nNwakwue maintained that the Aiteo facility was just one of several that had been left without proper decommissioning operation, noting that there are even many more assets that have not been sold.\n\nHe held, \u201cThere might be a lot of wellheads that are no longer producing but they are active, they are exposed to pressure. Whoever owns the asset should have a programme to temporarily abandon them to make them safer.\n\n\u201cThere are regulations, but who is monitoring? That is the question. Who is ensuring that the regulations are followed? Those are the questions that need to be answered.\n\n\u201cThe regulator should step up their game. They need to have a programme where facilities that are not no longer in use are temporarily or permanently abandoned and decommissioned to keep the environment safe.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of who is operating them, the primary issue is that there are regulations that have not been followed through and is important that the commission is alive to those responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSecretary General of the Niger Delta Ethnic Nationalities, Capt. Bassey Henshaw, told THISDAY that the oil companies must clean up the environment they had degraded over the years as well as pay compensation before any talk about leaving their onshore and shallow water operations in the region.\n\nHenshaw said, \u201cWe do not dispute the fact that they can go green or whatever, but there has to be some closure. You have a business running and there are issues emanating from those businesses. You do not wake up and say you are going green. All the issues have to be fixed and resolved.\n\n\u201cWe cannot hold them to ransom if they want to leave, but they have to have a closure of the previous business they have done, the degradation of the environment, the oil spillages and all.\u201d\n\nAn oil industry enthusiast, who had covered the sector widely, Ms Ijeoma Nwogwugwu, wrote in a recent article, \u201cAs a result, oil multinationals that want to avoid spending several millions of dollars on decommissioning, have taken advantage of the loopholes by selling their oil assets, including aging and rusting infrastructure, to local oil firms.\n\n\u201cSince the late 2000s, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have sold their stakes in about 20 to 25 oil blocks to local oil operators at ridiculously exorbitant prices.\n\n\u201cAll the acquisitions were leveraged buyouts that left several Nigerian banks with massive exposures to the oil and gas sector. Many of the loans are yet to be repaid to date.\u201d\n\nNwogwugwu said one way to avoid this debacle was to adopt what obtains in other jurisdictions where it is mandatory, prior to asset sale, for prospective bidders to possess the wherewithal to decommission aging oil and gas infrastructure. She mentioned the $3 billion sale of the Bass Strait operation in Australia, as a case in point.\n\nBut in a reaction, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), the industry regulator, stressed that the industry was not mature enough for wholesale decommissioning activities.\n\nHead, Health Safety and Environment, NUPRC, Mr Afeez Balogun, told THISDAY that for divested assets, the buying companies were always encouraged to look holistically at the liabilities and factor them into the purchase arrangements.\n\nAccording to Balogun, \u201cThe premise for full-blown decommissioning is not yet there in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, as many of the assets still have long mileage to offer. Add to that the fact that we are currently investing technology for improved oil recovery that will save a lot of costs and further increase the mileage of these assets.\n\n\u201cSo, there is really no crisis, as many uninformed people would want to assume. However, for divested assets, the buying companies are always encouraged to look holistically at the liabilities and factor that into the purchase arrangements.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the divesting companies are currently the big ones that have JV agreements with NNPC, and we are aware that decommissioning arrangements with the companies are being put in place.\u201d\n\nHowever, he stated that the PIA was now more explicit and gave more strength and bite to the rudimentary regulations that the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) already had in place.\n\n\u201cSo, before we reach a crisis level, if we ever will, all these arrangements should have given us adequate protection to make things easier,\u201d Balogun said.\n\n\u201cWe are also watching and are set to tap from all the numerous innovations being brought about by the developed world on decommissioning on all fronts, including environmental and legal considerations, technology, service provision and financing,\u201d he added.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, recently said the federal government would carefully scrutinise oil companies that would bid for the takeover of assets that Shell and other oil majors will be divesting from in the country.\n\n\u201cIn the past, companies were just allowed to buy assets that they had no capacity to operate. We would no longer allow that to happen again because government is the ultimate loser,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nShell and ExxonMobil are two of the most vocal IOCs in the country, which have been in talks to sell off some of their assets, especially those onshore and in shallow waters.\n\nA leading global oil and gas consulting firm, Wood McKenzie, had put the total value of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), the subsidiary Shell proposes to totally divest from, at $2.3 billion.\n\nAccording to the document, 19 Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) will be put up for sale by the oil giant in onshore locations and shallow waters in the company\u2019s eastern and western operations in the Niger Delta.\n\nOnly last month, Nigerian oil and gas company, Seplat Energy, revealed that it was actively engaged in negotiations to acquire ExxonMobil\u2019s shallow water assets in the country. A Reuters report had in 2019 put the expected potential disposals at $3 billion.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Oil prices rose over three per cent on Monday on hopes that the Omicron COVID-19 variant would have limited impact on global demand in 2022, even as surging cases caused flight cancellations in some countries.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude rose $2.59, or 3.40 per cent, to $78.73 a barrel yesterday, while the United States West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.01, or 2.7 per cent, to $75.80 a barrel.\n\nPrices of oil which had plunged by more than 10 per cent on November 26, when reports of a new variant first appeared, started to gain last week after early data suggested that Omicron could cause a milder level of illness.\n\nAlthough the variant had been spreading faster than any COVID-19 variant yet, there\u2019s been some relatively relieving news that most people infected with Omicron showed mild symptoms so far.\n\nHowever, more than 1,300 flights were cancelled by US airlines on Sunday as COVID-19 reduced the number of available crews while several cruise ships had to cancel stops.\n\nThis caused disruption to the supply of goods and services from isolating workers, notably air travel, although the global recovery story for 2022 still remains on track.\n\nBrent has risen by more than 45 per cent this year, supported by recovering demand and supply cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+.\n\nOn January 4, the producer alliance would decide whether to go ahead with a planned 400,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) production increase in February, but the cartel has so far stuck to its plans at its last meeting to boost output for January despite Omicron.\n\nOPEC has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by the 400,000 bpd each month, with Nigeria lagging behind for months.\n\nBut the country, a very active OPEC member had said even if prices fell to between $50 to $60, it won\u2019t be much of an issue, with the country\u2019s oil benchmark for the 2021 budget being $40.\n\nNigeria has failed for months to meet its allocation, due largely to waning investment, ageing upstream infrastructure and disruptions by some local host communities.\n\nBut the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) last week assured that by the year\u2019s end, Nigeria should be able to produce about 1.7 million bpd. That target now looks almost impossible.\n\nOn December 22, Nigeria\u2019s federal lawmakers approved a N17.126 trillion ($38 billion) budget for 2022, anchored on an oil price benchmark of $62 per barrel.\n\nThe approved oil price assumption was higher than the $57 per barrel price that President Muhammadu Buhari had proposed to the parliament on October 7, and also higher than the oil price benchmark of $40 per barrel adopted by the government for the 2021 budget.\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the increase in oil price was to reflect the current market values of the oil barrel in the international market and to generate more funds for critical sectors of the economy.\n\nHowever, the parliament retained the oil production target of 1.88 million bpd, including condensate production of between 300,000-400,000 bpd, for the purpose of its revenue calculation in 2022.\n\nThis compared to the output target of 1.86 million bpd the government had set for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nIn all, oil exports account for around 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange revenue, although the country has battled with a sharp drop in revenue amid a drop in production.\n\nNigeria has the capacity to pump around 2.2 million b/d of crude and condensate, but in recent months its output has been languishing below 1.55 million bpd.\n\nIn November, the NNPC was only able to contribute about N10.5 billion of its projected N122 billion to the federation account jointly run by the federal, state and local governments in the country.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Ethiopia says it is unhappy with the U.S. decision to revoke duty-free access for the East African country\u2019s exports.\n\nThe statement by Ethiopia\u2019s trade ministry on Monday came after the Biden administration on Dec. 23 terminated Ethiopia\u2019s eligibility for benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The U.S cited its disapproval of the war in the Tigray region for the action.\n\n\u201cThe Ethiopian government is saddened over the decision by the U.S. to remove it,\u201d from the preferential trade benefits, the ministry said. It asked the U.S. to reconsider its decision.\n\n\u201cEthiopia is carrying out various initiatives aimed at bringing peace and stability, political consensus and economic development in addition to conducting reforms in line with the longstanding relationship between the two countries,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe U.S. stopped Ethiopia\u2019s eligibility for the trade benefits despite pleas by a few U.S. legislators and Ethiopian lobby groups who asked the Biden administration to give the country more time to comply with U.S. demands.\n\nThe decision against the African nation was made over its failure to end a nearly yearlong war in the Tigray region that has led to \u201cgross violations\u201d of human rights, said the Biden statement. The action also stops Guinea and Mali from receiving the trade benefits as of January 1.\n\nThe Africa Growth and Opportunity Act provides sub-Saharan African nations duty-free access to the United States on the condition they meet certain requirements, including eliminating barriers to U.S. trade and investment and making progress toward political pluralism.\n\nThe U.S. and the United Nations say Ethiopian authorities have prevented trucks from delivering desperately needed food and other aid into Tigray. Scores of people have starved to death, The Associated Press has reported.\n\nIn September Biden warned that his administration would levy sanctions if Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed did not take steps to wind down the war in Tigray and other regions.\n\nOn November 3, Ethiopia\u2019s foreign ministry labeled the move as \u201cmisguided\u201d and \u201cunjustified intimidation\u201d and said the decision could affect the livelihoods of more than 200,000 low-income Ethiopians who work for companies that benefit from the preferential trade access.\n\nSome Ethiopian companies are already showing signs of a downturn in their export business.\n\n\u201cSeveral companies have already started leaving and we don\u2019t know what is next,\u201d a textile worker at the Hawassa Industrial Park, some 270 kilometers (168 miles) south of the capital, Addis Ababa, told the AP by phone on condition of anonymity fearing for his workplace safety.\n\nEthiopia in recent years had one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing economies, but the war in Tigray has dampened that momentum.",
