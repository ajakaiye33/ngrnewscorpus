It involves a hole in the wall between the heart\u2019s lower chambers.\n\nNarrating her ordeal to Vanguard, the mother, Mrs. Hannah Adekoya, said when she took Ademola to the hospital, the doctor said he had an infection.\n\n\u201cSo, they placed him on drips and antibiotics. The doctor checked him again and recommended an x-ray. We did it. In the report of the -ray, it showed he has Cevenicat disease. After that, the doctor recommended an echocardiogram.\u201d\n\nShe was then referred to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH, Ayike House. \u201cWhen I got to LASUTH, I was able to see a cardiologist.

It can only be closed only through surgery. They told me the bill is N5 million.\u201d\n\nAnd with the option that the surgery could only be done at Babcock or abroad, Adekoya took her baby to Babcock to make enquiries.\n\n\u201cGetting there, we started all over; they did the echo test again and it still showed the same problem. Later they gave us the bill for the surgery, and that we have to do it within two months,\u201d she lamented profusely.\n\nShe appealed to all Nigerians to help save her child. \u201cPlease I need Nigerians to assist me. I am a graduate. My husband is a graduate too.\n\n\u201cWe got married in 2019. I don\u2019t have a job.

          "text": "\u2026As governor reiterates his commitment to lead with fear of God in an environment hallmarked with peace, justice, equity, progress\n\nThe Prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria, His Eminence, Dr. Samuel Chukwuemeka Kanu Uche, yesterday extolled the leadership qualities of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State, describing him as \u201can erudite scholar, quintessential, sagacious, benevolent, magnanimous and people\u2019s governor who always cares for the people\u201d.\n\nDr. Kanu Uche, who commended Gov. Ugwuanyi for his administration\u2019s giant strides in promoting peace and good governance, also lauded him for his resilience and commitment to the welfare of the state\u2019s workers and retirees, in spite of the nation\u2019s economic challenges.\n\nSpeaking during the 9th National Convention of the Church, holding in Enugu, the Methodist Prelate added: \u201cYou (Ugwuanyi) have been promoting your works, we are proud of you. You are making the Igbo man proud. You are making Nigeria proud and I don\u2019t expect anything less because you occupy the seat of Michael Okpara who happened to be the leader of all the Igbos.\n\n\u201cEnugu is a home for all Igbo and we know it. Under you Enugu is peaceful and we are very happy.\n\n\u201cWe have enjoyed your love, your kindness, your mercy and the Methodists are proud to be here.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you one of the motivating factors for bringing this gathering to Enugu. I brought them to our regional capital; I brought them to Enugu to come and enjoy the beauty of Enugu and we have been experiencing peace and cool weather here.\u201d\n\nDr. Kanu Uche therefore thanked Gov. Ugwuanyi, who was present at the religious event, for his immeasurable support for the Church, and beseeched the Almighty God to elevate the governor to greater heights after his tenure.\n\nHe explained that the National Convention was \u201cin line with the vision of our founding father, John Wesley, who believes in spreading scriptural holiness, promoting evangelical faith and social action\u201d, saying: \u201cThat is why Methodists don\u2019t believe in having private jet\u201d, among other luxuries.\n\nAddressing the Methodist faithful, Gov. Ugwuanyi formally welcomed them to Enugu State and expressed delight that the Church chose the state for the religious event.\n\nNoting that the event themed: \u2018Watch and Pray\u2019 is \u201ca period of revival for the Church, expansion of God\u2019s Kingdom and prayers for the nation, the governor stressed that \u201cour nation, Nigeria, has never been more in need of prayers than now, given the myriad of challenges confronting it\u201d.\n\nHe therefore maintained that the nation\u2019s state of affairs compels all members of the Body of Christ to pray for the peace, unity and progress of the country, stating: \u201cI therefore salute the Methodist Church Nigeria for doing the needful\u201d.\n\nGov. Ugwuanyi pointed out that the National Convention of the Methodist Church Nigeria which came on the heels of the Second Plenary Meeting of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) held in Enugu from 19th to 27th August 2012, \u201cis spiritually reinforcing and underscores God\u2019s love for the state\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe good people of Enugu State will savor this bountiful harvest of prayers and blessings for a very long time. The expression \u2018Enugu State is in the Hands of God\u2019 is not just a mantra but an article of faith that captures our covenant with God, as we see God\u2019s Hands in all we do.\n\n\u201cI thank the Clergy and laity of Methodist Church Nigeria for their continuing prayers and wise counsel in support of our administration.\n\n\u201cYour solidarity and fidelity are highly cherished, and I assure you of our unflinching commitment to lead with the fear of God in an environment hallmarked with peace, justice, equity, unity, security and progress\u201d.\n\nIn their brief remarks, the Archbishop of Enugu, Methodist Church Nigeria, Most Rev. Barr. Christopher Ede and other clerics who spoke at the event equally applauded Gov. Ugwuanyi for his unalloyed commitment and support for the Church, as well as the culture of peace and good governance his administration has cultivated and entrenched in Enugu State in spite of the nation\u2019s economic, security and public health challenges, which have drastically affected the lean resources of the state.",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2014 Detractors at work ahead of 2023 election, allegations spurious should be ignored\n\nDayo Johnson Akure\n\nThe Senator representing the southern senatorial district in Ondo state, Nicholas Tofowomo has described the allegation of rituals dealings with some constituents in the district as blackmail and move to tarnish his image ahead of the 2023 election.\n\nA lawyer had written a petition to the police to investigate, arrest and prosecute the senator on allegations of rituals dealings with some constituents in Ondo South Senatorial District of Ondo State.\n\nReacting to the allegation, senator Tofowomo through his SA Media and Publicity, Akinrinlola Olumide described the allegation as \u201cmischievous, untrue, and falsely concocted to dent his image ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nAkinrinlola said that \u201cSenator Tofowomo is innocent and open for investigation by the police. But it is necessary to set the record straight for the whole world to know that politicians and detractors are at work ahead of the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cThe politically orchestrated petition should be ignored by the good people of Ondo South and the unsuspecting public because the Lawyer only wrote to mislead the public for political gains.\n\n\u201cThe spurious allegations against the Senator are mischievous, untrue, and falsely concocted to dent his image ahead of the 2023 general election because of his intimidating and distinguished achievements within two years as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the record, there was no meeting held at the residence of the Senator in the said dates quoted in the petition by the writer where people were lured to take oaths or swear with car radiator water to prove loyalty to Senator Tofowomo.\n\n\u201cThe only meeting held last year at the residence of Senator Nicholas Tofowomo was the PDP senatorial meeting in Ondo South with all the political leaders in attendance and another with all his former 92 Aides where they all gathered at his residence to observe a day fasting and prayers programme for his quick recovery over his health challenges and the Senator was not the organiser but a unanimous decision by all of his former Aides to pray for his well-being and they were led by three pastors. This could be verified from any of his former Aides.\n\n\u201cWe are not surprised that the writer of the petition has taken up a new trade-in falsehood and character assassination.\n\n\u201cWe challenge him and his sponsors to come out and back up their written story with proof (pictorial or video evidence). If they can\u2019t provide proof, the police should arrest the Lawyer and prosecute him immediately for raising such an allegation against an innocent man.\n\n\u201cThe public should know that the petition writer is a card-carrying member of the ruling APC, and his ultimate goal is to bring down Senator Tofowomo.\n\n\u201cWhy would an APC man panic and get worried over the affairs of the PDP? How can anyone lie this much for a political purpose?.\n\n\u201cSenator Tofowomo is a man that carries God\u2019s grace and a good Christian who cannot suffer disgrace. His detractors have tried many times to bring him down via social media by using their proxies but they have failed repeatedly because whoever God promotes, nobody can demote.\n\nThe SA noted that \u201d All the allegations are unfounded and without factual foundations. The good people of Ondo State should disregard it.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We need all your support because electricity is part of life.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we have agreed to provide 24/7 power supply to our customers, so that the first anger of our customer is taken care of and moving ahead, we want to treat our customers with affection.\n\n\u201cIn three years from now, every customer of EEDC will be metered to stop the estimated billings which many customers are complaining of.\n\n\u201cIn the area of transparency, we are being transparent based on our dealings with customers. All the bills we raise to customers will be electronically available.\n\n\u201cI am so elated to receive the leadership of the media today, and I plead with you to continue this partnership,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of the NUJ, Enugu Correspondents\u2019 Chapel, Comrade Lawrence Njoku told the EEDC boss that the union was ready to collaborate with the organization in order to ensure efficient service delivery.\n\nNjoku, who acknowledged the steady improvement in power supply, urged the company to sustain the tempo.\n\n\u201cWe can say that customers are now happy with the serious improvement in power supply. We commend the EEDC for that feat.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we shall continue to carry on the campaign, especially against power theft and vandalism,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso on the delegation were the Vice Chairman, Comrade Ignatius Okpara, the General Secretary, Comrade Emma Ugwueze, the Assistant Secretary, Comrade Moses Oyediran and the Financial Secretary, Comrade Nnamdi Mbawike.\n\nMeanwhile, the EEDC has also assured its customers in Awka, Ogidi and Ekwulobia, Anambra State, of improved power supply.\n\nThis is following the commissioning of the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) 2x60MVA 132/33KV Station at Awka, Anambra State by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, in company of the Executive Governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano and the Managing Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC), Mr. Chiedu Ugbo.\n\nThe Managing Director/CEO, EEDC, Mr. Praveen Chorghade, who was also present at the commissioning expressed happiness over the project, stating that it was timely, and would greatly impact the service quality of electricity customers under its Awka, Ogidi and Ekwulobia districts.\n\nHe further disclosed that the 2 x 60MVA power transformers will de-load the existing 40MVA transformer, thereby drastically increasing the available distribution capacity by 300%. This would enable EEDC to accommodate more load and energy to meet the increasing power demands of customers under its Awka, Ogidi and Ekwulobia districts.\n\n\u201cAwka is fast developing with increasing demand for electricity supply and this project will do justice to that\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is also a major stake in increasing efforts in line with our commitment to deliver improved supply services to our customers in Awka and our entire franchise area\u201d, Praveen stated.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that over 35 communities will benefit from this project. They include, Amansea, Egbeagu, Umuokpara, Orede, Ebenebe, Ugbenu, Okpuno, Mgbakwu, Umudunu, Abagana, Orofia, Eziawutolo, Amaenye, Ukpo, Abba, Enu-Ifite, Ezinato-Ifite, Agbana-Ifite, Umuayom, Umunnoke, Umuoramma, Umuokpu, Achallaoji, Umunamoke, Agbana, Umudiaba, Amachalla, Amudo, Umuzocha, Awkuzu, Aguleri, Nteje, Achalla, Ukwulu, Nawgu and environs.\n\nAbia Speaker berates EEDC over poor services",

          "title": "How Buhari broke the jinx at NNPC, by Femi Adesina",
          "text": "The news came like a thundering typhoon last week. For the first time in its 44 years history, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had made a profit.\n\nNet profit after tax stood at N287 billion in Year 2020, sequel to the completion of the statutory Annual Audit exercise. What year? 2020. Year of the Coronavirus pandemic, when most of the world, including Nigeria, was under lockdown! And here was NNPC, recording profit first time in its history. How did it happen? How can it?\n\nWell, it happened because perhaps for the first time in the history of the country, and of the NNPC, there is a President who is not using the place like a personal automated teller machine. He\u2019s not collecting millions upon millions of dollars by fiat, nor is he giving directives for any under the table deal. And that President also happens to be the Minister for Petroleum Resources.\n\nBefore we discuss how Muhammadu Buhari broke the jinx, let\u2019s consider how naysayers responded to the good news. They first pretended it didn\u2019t happen. The announcement came, and it didn\u2019t resonate. They didn\u2019t share it widely on social media, some traditional media platforms didn\u2019t even publish it. Those who reluctantly did, made it sound more like an obituary announcement. What a country!\n\nRemember they had said they would sell NNPC before the 2019 elections, which they had thought they would win. They lost. Flat. And the would-be sellers, and the prospective buyers, were naturally not happy that the oil corporation had made profit: under Buhari.\n\nAfter first trying to downplay the news, they began to pick holes in it. The profit was only on paper, and didn\u2019t exist in real terms. It was money that should have gone into the Federation Account, and was withheld by NNPC. Blah, blah, blah. The same NNPC they had wanted to sell to their friends.\n\nI like the online interventions to the development by two friends and patriots. Simbo Olorunfemi, author and publisher, said: \u201cTo habitually doubt good news, yet never hesitant about embracing bad news, is an eloquent proof of the state of mind.\u201d\n\nProfound. Deep. Food for thought. All the years oil prices hit the rooftops, and NNPC recorded losses, they believed. Now, to hear that the same outfit made profit in a lockdown year, they disbelieved. Thomases! Doubters. Unless I see the mark of nails on his hands, and the spear wound on his side, I wouldn\u2019t believe. \u201cThen said he to Thomas! Be not faithless, but believing.\u201d\n\nThe second intervention online is by Kurtis Adigba, a lawyer and \u2018one man battalion\u2019 for Buhari, and for Nigeria. He submitted: \u201cHate is not a stock or equity we must own a piece of. It pays dividends but only in death and destruction.\u201d\n\nYes. They hated the news of NNPC profit, because it came under a most unlikely man. How dare he? Who permitted him! Anything we don\u2019t do, can\u2019t be done by anybody else.\n\nNow, how did Buhari do it? What did he do differently, that made NNPC a winning corporation? Permit me to recall this piece I did in November last year, which answers most of the questions. It was under the headline; The Essential Buhari: NNPC GMD\u2019s Testimony:\n\nOn Friday last week, Mallam Mele Kolo Kyari, Group Managing Director of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), held an engagement with energy editors across diverse media platforms. Yours truly was invited.\n\nI currently serve as media adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari, but I remain essentially a newspaper man. There\u2019s nothing I love better. And when done in government, the media still beckons, by the grace of God. So I felt quite at home at the NNPC event, which was designed to update the media on current developments in the petroleum industry.\n\nWhen a General Officer Commanding (GOC) moves, the brigade commanders and all other brass hats move too. At that outing with the GMD were the managing directors of subsidiaries, group general managers, and Who is Who in NNPC. The information garnered was worth its weight in gold.\n\nNNPC is transforming from an integrated oil and gas company into an energy company, Mele Kyari disclosed. And quite contrary to the opacity of the past, operations of the energy company are as transparent as possible. His words:\n\n\u201cOver the past one and a half years, we have tried to keep that promise by sustaining the publication of our Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR). No company, to my knowledge, does this.\n\n\u201cWe have taken our transparency drive a notch higher by publishing our Audited Financial Statement for the 2018 and 2019 financial years on our website for all interested persons to see the significant turnaround in our performance recording 99.8% year-on-year.\u201d\n\nWhich corporation was the GMD talking about? NNPC? Didn\u2019t we know the place as the automated teller machine of presidents, oil ministers, any political party in power, and also the object of pillage by those who run the place? But under President Muhammadu Buhari, it is a new energy company, because a new broom was in town, and was sweeping so clean. More about that later.\n\nKyari said there was no information anybody wanted about NNPC operations that was not already in the public domain., adding: \u201cI can say that we have kept our word as far as transparency and accountability are concerned. We will continue to do more until the word opacity is no longer associated with the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nSome exploratory successes by NNPC, according to the GMD, include oil find in commercial quantity in the Upper Benue Trough, very high prospect of oil find in Kolmani River III Well, while seismic data collection is ongoing in the Bida Basin, \u201cand we are relaunching exploration work in the Chad Basin.\u201d\n\nThe world focuses more on gas as energy of the future, rather than petroleum, and the NNPC Boss said Nigeria was not left behind:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are investing aggressively in gas to take advantage of the energy transition and get Nigeria ready for the future in the face of the dwindling fortunes of petroleum liquids.\n\n\u201cYou may be aware of the NLNG Train 7 and other gas infrastructure projects\u2026all these are aimed at ensuring that Nigeria takes its rightful place in the emerging global energy order where natural gas is envisaged to play a pivotal role.\u201d\n\nThe Yuletide season is often characterized by severe fuel scarcity. But the GMD assured that the energy company has solid arrangements in place to sustain fuel supply across the country., \u201cand we are sure of maintaining zero fuel queues throughout the Christmas and New Year festive season into 2021.\u201d\n\nCan there be a parley between the media and NNPC at this time, and deregulation of the prices of petrol not feature? It would sure be incomplete. Hear the GMD: \u201cEven though gasoline price is as high as N464/liter in Niger and more than double our N160/litre range in most West African countries, we would continue to ensure Nigerians benefit from lowest comparative prices in West Africa and beyond.\u201d\n\nHe gave comparative prices of gasoline in some West African countries as at November 16, 2020 thus: Senegal, N549. Mali, N438, Chad, N368, Sierra Leone, N274, Liberia, N328, Ghana, N325, Cameroon, N446, and many others.\n\nThe GMD used the opportunity of the parley to debunk allegations that NNPC failed to remit funds that should accrue to the Federation, and that it illegally withdrew money from the NLNG Dividends Account.\n\n\u201cSuch is not possible under the TSA (Treasury Single Account) arrangement,\u201d he posited.\n\nTalking further on the new order of transparency in NNPC, he said President Muhammadu Buhari, who doubles as Minister of Petroleum, \u201chas never made any demand of us, has never asked for a single thing for himself, or for any individual.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnytime I see him, and we need to take a decision, he only asks; \u2018is this in the interest of the ordinary Nigerian? Is it in the interest of our country?\u2019 Once we can defend that, he gives approval. Not once has he asked for anything personal.\u201d\n\nIn this Nigeria? A President will not give orders to NNPC to cut corners, and bring out millions upon millions of dollars, to fund private projects, or simply stash such money away? This Buhari is sure a strange one, a worthy example of probity, transparency, accountability. No wonder the Hausa man calls him Mai Gaskiya (the honest one).\n\nHe was military governor. Oil Minister for over three years. Head of State for 20 months. Chairman, Petroleum Trust Fund. Now President for six years running. Yet, he owns no petrol station, not to talk of an oil bloc. Do they make them like this anymore? I doubt.\n\nI recall a testimony also given by Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola, former two-term Governor of Lagos State, when he was Minister of Power, Works and Housing. He said not once, not even half of a time, did President Buhari ever send anyone to him for patronage of any kind, nor did he show preference for anybody. And I ask again: do they make them like this anymore? I doubt.\n\nA final recall. One night, I had visited the President at home, just on a social call. It was about 8 pm, and just two of us were in his waiting room. The other man is ex-this, ex-that in the country, having held many prominent positions. He told me: \u201cLook at this sprawling place. Only two of us waiting to see the Big Boss. It didn\u2019t use to be like this. This place would be like a market till about 3 am daily, as people come to cut deals, and take a slice of the National cake. But President Buhari does no deal with anyone. That\u2019s why only two of us are here.\u201d\n\nWhat a man! What testimonies all round! Surely, they don\u2019t make them like this anymore. Or do they?\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "text": "Momentum swings in favour of Nigerian business mogul Valentine Ozigbo as the Court of Appeal Awka Division sitting in Abuja in its judgement delivered today, Friday, September 3, 2021 declared him the authentic governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the November election holding in Anambra State.\n\nOn July 5, 2021, Senator Ugochukwu Uba, who did not participate in the PDP primary, instituted a suit against the party and its candidate, Valentine Ozigbo and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), challenging Ozigbo\u2019s candidature for the November 6, 2021 governorship election.\n\nIn its ruling, the Court of Appeal recognised the gubernatorial primary conducted by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP on June 26, 2021 at the Prof. Dora Akunyili Women\u2019s Development Centre as lawful and was visibly upset with the 1st respondent and his lawyers for forum shopping.\n\nThe panel of Justices presided by Honourable Justice Dongban Mensa, also ordered the national electoral body, INEC, to immediately publish Valentine Ozigbo as the candidate of the PDP, the main opposition party on its website.\n\nThe court awarded a cost of ten million against the Senator Ugochukwu Ubah for being a meddlesome interloper.\n\nThis ruling paves the way for the PDP to launch its promised \u201crobust campaign\u201d for the governorship of the south-eastern state.\n\nMr Alex Ejesieme, SAN, the lead Counsel to Mr Valentine Ozigbo, had argued in the appeal that the judgement of the Awka High Court delivered by Justice Nwabunike was faulty because it was based on a judgement by a Federal Capital Territory High Court which the Court of Appeal had voided.\n\nRecall that barely 24 hours after Senator Uba instituted the suit, Justice O. A. Nwabunike curiously granted an ex parte injunction restraining INEC from carrying out its constitutional duty and also abridged the time within which the defendants are legally obliged to file their defence from 42 days to only 3 days in violation of Order 16 Rule 1(2) of the Anambra State High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2019.\n\nThe high court judge went on to deny the defendants time to respond to the processes served on them and proceeded with the hearing of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and delivering judgement against Ozigbo and the PDP. In a dramatic twist, Justice Nwabunike made away with the case file preventing the defendants from obtaining copies of the judgement for their appeal.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the PDP had slammed Nwabunike labelling his ruling as \u201ca black-market judgement which cannot stand in appeal\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur party cautions Justice Nwabunike not to continue to test the will of the generality of the people of Anambra, whose mandate, being expressed in our candidate, Valentine Ozigbo, is being undermined, as such may trigger serious crisis in the state,\u201d the PDP warned when it called on the National Judicial Commission and Nigerians to intervene in the matter.\n\nAlready regarded as a frontrunner in the November poll, Valentine Ozigbo, who describes himself as a child of grace, is the immediate past President and Group CEO of Transcorp Plc. His emergence as the candidate of the PDP in the keenly contested primary is regarded as one of the most inspiring stories in Nigeria\u2019s recent political history.\n\nIn July, Ozigbo named a seasoned administrator and two-time Commissioner of Local Government Affairs, Mrs Azuka Enemo as his running mate, a move that has further boosted his prospects in the race for the governorship.",

Let us assume that they are up to 3,000, what it means is that we have a policemen to every 200,000 people. How effective can that policeman be? Then, we come to arms and ammunition, what do the police have? And when it comes to modern equipment for combating criminality, how much of it do the police have?\n\n\u201cAnd the same thing goes for all other security agencies. They are in South-South battling militants, they are in the South-East battling IPOB, they are in North-East battling Boko Haram and ISWAP and insurgents and they are in the North-West battling bandits.\n\n\u201cHere, the bandits have infiltrated the communities recruiting young men with as low as N5,000 along with drugs and other intoxicants. We must stop the culture of not reporting criminals because of tribal or family affiliations.\u201d\n\nHe pledged to recruit more vigilantes to strengthen security architecture in the state.\n\nHe stated that the vigilantes would be recruited in all the 34 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe governor said the recruits would be supported financially and logistically.\n\nThe governor also said the vigilantes would be posted to strategic places to help the police and other security agencies with relevant information on security.\n\n\u201cIf they detect any crime or criminalities, they will alert the security in arresting the situation. These initiative will assist in protecting communities from bandits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IGP said they were in the process of recruiting additional 20,000 policemen from across the country.\n\n\u201cI am in Katsina on a working visit and I will also meet with other arms of security services to see how best to tackle the security situation in the states.\n\n\u201cI came in as IGP at a very difficult time. When I came in, it was in the South-East and South-South that there were series of killings including killing of security personnel and our places of work destroyed.\n\n\u201cWhile the South-South and South-East are stabilising, the situation in the North-Central and the North-West is getting worse.\n\n\u201cWe are going to work harder to see that citizens go about their lawful businesses unmolested. Very soon, we will start our recruitment process. With security policing and the fresh recruitment, we hope that the strength of the Nigerian police will be re-enforced.\n\n\u201cWe will recruit from every local government in the country. It is the directive of the President that we should recruit 10,000 for 2020 and anther 10,000 for 2021. From across all the 771 local government areas. We are going to redeploy these policemen to their local government areas to fight crime,\u201d he said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh,, Abuja and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nFederal civil servants may soon be subjected to compulsory COVID-19 vaccination as part of plan to weaken the strength of the disease in Nigeria.\n\nThis is as government assured that sufficient dose of the vaccine would be made available before the policy on compulsory vaccination for civil servants would be implemented.\n\nSecretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who disclosed this at the Nigeria Health Commissioners\u2019 Forum meeting in Abuja, said federal civil servants are representatives of the government and could be assigned to represent government at public functions, locally or internationally, hence the need to be fully vaccinated.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe vaccine mandate will soon come. The world is gravitating towards that direction. I can confirm to you that by the time western countries are done vaccinating its people, unvaccinated persons won\u2019t be allowed access into any of the western countries without the vaccine certificate. So, it\u2019s better we begin to prepare our people at home.\u201d\n\nHe, thus, registered his concern that Nigeria has been experiencing an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases lately, but assured Nigerians that the response team are working assiduously with reinvigorated approach to contain the community transmission, thus soliciting for more support from Nigerians.\n\nMinister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora, said the Federal Government was working towards increasing domestic resources for the health sector by pooling \u2018sin\u2019 taxes on tobacco and other products.\n\nHe said doing so was important because funding has been the major challenge of the health sector, adding, \u201cwe need to begin to tax commodities like alcohol, and cigarettes, among others which causes a lot of damage to the human body.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are saying if people take these things, let us find a way to put some tax on it so that we can get some money to fund the health sector in addition to existing funding structures,\u201d Mamora said.\n\n\u2022 PFN faults plan\n\nHowever, the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), the umbrella body of over more than 65 million people in pentecostal churches in the country, has described as illogical, the move by the Federal Government to punish Nigerians, who have refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIts President, Bishop Wale Oke, who is also the presiding bishop of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries, Ibadan, made the disclosure at the on-going 39th annual holy ghost convention of the ministry with the theme, \u2018Abundant Rain\u2019, holding at the campus of Precious Cornerstone University, Garden of Victory, Ibadan, Oyo State\n\nHe also cautioned government against molesting or punishing Navy Commodore Kunle Olawunmi (retd), for alleging a cover up by the government of some high profile politicians behind the raging insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\nOke urged President Muhammadu Buhari and his administration to be rational in their approach as regards punishing Nigerians who refused to take the COVID-19 vaccines, adding that the available vaccines could not even go round all the people in the country.\n\n\u201cOne doubts if Nigeria can yet boast of having 10 million vaccines available for a country with over 200million population. If the Federal Government makes available about 250 million vaccines and Nigerians, who are yet to be vaccinated refused the COVID-19 vaccines, then the government can be justified in its action. Unless this be the case, one will be forced to view the whole thing as another subtle move to deliberately punish some sections of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

He said between 2001 and 2019, the Federal Government, approved and released the total sum of N7trillion to the NDDC as income from statutory and non statutory sources.\n\nHe said the the Federal Government was particularly concerned with the colossal loss occasioned by uncompleted and unverified development projects in the Niger Delta Region, in spite of the huge resources made available to it to uplift the living standard of the citizens of the region.\n\nHe also expressed concerns with multitudes of NDDC\u2019s bank accounts amounting to 362 and lack of proper reconciliation of accounts.\n\nBuhari, represented at the presentation ceremony by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), directed that the forensic audit report be forwarded to the Federal Ministry of Justice for legal review and relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to do justice to the findings.\n\n\u201cWe have on record over 13,777 projects, the execution of which is substantially compromised. The Federal Government will in consequence apply the law to remedy the deficiencies outlined in the audit report as appropriate. This will include, but not limited to, initiation of criminal investigations, prosecution, recovery of funds not properly utilised for the public purposes for which they were meant for review of the laws to reposition and restructure the NDDC for the efficiency of better service delivery amongst others. In all these instances of actions, legal due processes will strictly be complied with.\u201d\n\nMinister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, who submitted the report, said though the exercise had a checkered history, the President and all those who supported and ensured its success should be commended.\n\nHe said the audit was not done to witch-hunt anyone, but to ensure that huge sums of funds committed to the development of the region through the NDDC yearly were judiciously used.\n\nHe said the report of the audit committee showed that their were over 13,000 abandoned projects in the Niger Delta, adding that even before the submission of the report, some contractors returned to site on their own and completed about 77 road projects.\n\nHe lamented that the region had remained backwards since 1958 in spite of successive governments efforts through the creation of various interventionist programmes and projects.\n\nLead Forensic Auditor, Alhaji Kabir Ahmed, in a brief overview of the report, said the team recommended managerial and structural changes, chief of which is the downsizing of NDDC board, with members appointed on part time basis.\n\nThe appointment of members of the board of the NDDC had been suspended until the release of the audit report. Ahmed also disclosed that oil companies in the country were still in default of their contributions to the commission.\n\nIt recommended that the government withdraw the licence of any oil company which defaults for a period of three years. It also recommended the deduction of 15 per cent ecological fund at source and paid to the commission as both the federal and state governments have failed to make payments to the commission. The team recommended as a measure of effective revenue collections, that the Federal Inland Revenue Services collects fund on behalf of NDDC from oil companies in the country.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "*Shows evidence of substantial compromise in execution of 13,777 projects\n\n*Criminal investigations, prosecution to follow\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong in Lagos and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has vowed that the federal government will take necessary measures to recover the over N6 trillion allegedly misappropriated in the running of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) between 2000 and 2019.\n\nTo this end, the president has directed that the report of the forensic audit on the NDDC be forwarded to the Federal Ministry of Justice for necessary action.\n\nThe president who spoke shortly after he received the Forensic Audit Report from the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, claimed that there had been evidence of substantial compromise in the execution of 13,777 as well as the existence of, \u201cmultitude of NDDC\u2019s bank accounts amounting to 362\u201d which lacked proper reconciliation of accounts.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, who received the report on behalf of the president, therefore assured that the report would be critically analysed for necessary action and implementation.\n\nBuhari had in October 2019, ordered a holistic forensic audit on the activities of the NDDC from when it was established till August 2019, in response to the yearnings of the people to make the commission more effective and result oriented.\n\nAccording to the president, there was nothing tangible on ground to show in the region for the huge funds committed over the years through the Commission, which many had described as a conduit pipe for politicians in siphoning trillions of naira.\n\nThe president noted that his administration was however concerned about the colossal loss occasioned by uncompleted and unverified development projects in the region, in spite of the huge resources made available to uplift the living standard of the citizens, hence the forensic audit of the Commission.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is on record that between 2001 and 2019, the federal government has approved N3, 375, 735,776,794.93 as budgetary allocation and N2,420,948,894,191 as Income from Statutory and Non Statutory Sources, which brings the total figure to the sum of approximately N6 trillion given to the NDDC.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that considerable resources have been channeled by the federal government to the development of the Niger Delta from 2001 to 2019. It is therefore important for the federal government and the public to be properly informed of what has been spent and how that has been spent.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the forensic audit is to ensure probity and accountability in the use of public funds. It is against this background that the federal government will without hesitation strategically implement all aspects of the audit exercise that will promote probity and greater prosperity for the Niger Delta Region and Nigeria as whole,\u201d he added.\n\nSpecifically, Buhari disclosed that his administration would apply the law to remedy the deficiencies outlined in the audit report as appropriate.\n\n\u201cThis will include but not limited to initiation of criminal investigations, prosecution, recovery of funds not properly utilised for the public purposes for which they were meant for review of the laws to reposition and restructure the NDDC for the efficiency of better service delivery amongst others. In all these instances of actions, legal due processes will strictly be complied with,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, while submitting the report stated that the exercise was not done to witch-hunt anyone, but to ensure that the huge sums of funds committed to the area yearly are justified.\n\nHe lamented that the region had remained backwards since 1958 in spite of successive governments\u2019 efforts through the creation of various interventionist programmes and projects.\n\nAccording to him, the report of the audit committee showed that their were over 13,000 abandoned projects in the Niger Delta, adding that even before the submission of the report some contractors have returned to site on their own and completed about 77 road projects. According to Akpabio, the name and identity of a vast number of beneficiary companies were also captured in the report.\n\n\u201cVia Field Verification, the Forensic Auditors established the exact status of all contracts for projects and programmes in all constituent states during the period under review classified into completed, ongoing, abandoned, terminated, taken-over and non-existent, \u201d he declared\n\nThe Minister disclosed that the auditors also focused on funding gaps, irregularities, mismanagement and due process violations/conflicts of interest.\n\nHe added: \u201cA Personnel Audit and Review of the governance and organisational structure of NDDC was also carried out. An operational guideline/manual and a fit-for-purpose organogram that would aid the transformation of NDDC to a globally competitive development agency has been developed as well.\n\n\u201cAvailable financial records of the commission were analysed with the aim of establishing the total amount of funds received by the Commission from all sources, both statutory and non-statutory and the total funds and other resources paid to contractors as well as the total amount outstanding as debts with regards to such projects within the period under reference.\n\n\u201cThe auditors have also provided policy recommendations, in terms of measures that should be taken to ensure the prevention of such irregularities and mismanagement, going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Lead Forensic Auditor, Alhaji Kabir Ahmed, in a brief overview of the report, said that the team recommended managerial as well as structural changes, chief of which was the downsizing of the NDDC\u2019s board.\n\nHe also said to reduce cost, the team recommended that members of the Board should henceforth be appointed on part time basis.\n\nWhile disclosing that oil companies in the country were still in default of their contributions to the Commission, Ahmed recommended that the government should withdraw the licence of any oil company that defaults for a period of three years.\n\nThe report also recommended the deduction of 50 per cent ecological fund at source, which should be paid to the Commission because both the federal and state governments had failed to make payments to the Commission.\n\nIn addition, the auditors recommended as a measure of effective revenue collections, the Federal Inland Revenue Services should collect funds on behalf of NDDC from oil companies in the country. The report further called on the government to recover from contractors and former and present staff of the NDDC, who have been indicted for short changing the NDDC.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says AfCFTA is indispensable if industrial development is to take off on the continent\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo yesterday estimated that the African cross-border informal trade is worth $93 billion.\n\nThis is just as the vice president begins a four-day official visit to Arusha, Tanzania today.\n\nOsinbajo, in a message sent to a roundtable on industrialisation in Africa with the theme: \u201cPositioning African Industries for Economic Transformation and Continental Free Trade,\u201d organised by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) to celebrate its Golden Jubilee, stressed the need to rapidly operationalise effort by Afreximbank to establish a Pan-African Payments and Settlement Platform.\n\nThis, according to him, \u201cwill go a long way in creating the desired continental payments system and also in facilitating cross-border informal trade which is estimated to be about $93 billion per annum.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, according to a statement by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, also declared that the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offers limitless opportunities for the industrialisation of Africa, urging authorities to take the right actions to actualise them.\n\nHe stated that such actions include the protection of local industries and improving value chains.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cfor certain, the AfCFTA is indispensable if industrial development is to take off in Africa because it offers wider markets and economies of scale which are essential for manufacturing to be competitive.\n\n\u201cWe must take policy actions to create an environment in which businesses can thrive. To start with, we must adopt the right type of macroeconomic and industrial policies.\n\n\u201cIt is important for African governments to provide a stable macroeconomic environment which avoids and smoothens out volatility in prices, sharp deteriorations in the current account and budget deficits and of course, rapid accumulation in debt burdens.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on actions that would boost manufacturing, Osinbajo said, \u201con the industrial side, policies like tariffs, quotas, subsidies and non-tariff barriers which protect our infant industries so that they can create jobs and enable learning are vital.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cwell negotiated rules of origin are important in the context of the free trade agreements as they are key to preventing trans-shipment and the deflection of trade. Without them, firms from non-state parties could set up simple labelling operations in one member-state with a view to shipping already finished products to another member State without really adding any value.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo observed that it is important for MAN to involve itself in an advisory capacity to government negotiators \u201cas we go further into the rules of origin negotiations (these rules negotiations have, of course, started), but I think as we go on, we should get more contributions and advise from MAN.\n\n\u201cOur manufacturers must also strive to become competitive after clearly specified time periods so that they can withstand the ever present danger of stiff competition from imports. In other words, while our manufacturing industries must be nurtured and supported, they cannot remain infants forever\u201d.\n\nStressing the need to enhance industrial competitiveness, Osinbajo noted that, \u201cone of the ways to increase the competitiveness of African industries is to develop and deepen regional value chains wherein production systems starting from conception and design right through to supply of raw materials, processing, transport, storage, marketing and sales take place within our countries and continent.\u201d\n\nCiting examples of Nigeria and South Africa, he explained, \u201cwhen we export commodities to the rest of the world, we are also exporting jobs and the positive spillover effects such as learning that come with manufacturing are lost.\n\n\u201cHappily, we are already beginning to see some green shoots emerging in this regard as Nigerian fertiliser blenders obtain phosphates from Morocco for blending with urea produced in our petrochemical plants. Similarly, South African car manufacturers already buy leather for car seats from Botswana. We however need much more of such activities.\n\nHe identified some other things that need to be put in place \u201cif we are to see the kind of manufacturing activity that we desire. First of all, we need to develop a strong infrastructural base. Extensive, cheap and affordable infrastructure is vital for the success of our economies.\n\n\u201cWe must build a network of roads, bridges and rail that will facilitate the movement of goods and people just as we build the electricity plants to power our factories and the broadband networks that lubricate modern business. It would also be essential in the interim to develop sites with dedicated infrastructural and regulatory structures like Special Economic Zones and Shared Facilities for small businesses.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo added that another major objective of policies aimed at preparing industries for AfCFTA \u201cmust be to ease payments across borders and implementation of the protocols on free movement of persons\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vice President is going on a brief official visit to Arusha in Tanzania from Thursday (today) to Monday.\n\nOsinbajo, who is expected to be received by his Tanzanian counterpart, Dr. Philip Mpango, will be visiting the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR), an African Union agency in Arusha, among other engagements before he returns to Abuja on Monday.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Let us assume that they are up to 3,000, what it means is that we have a policeman for every 200,000 people. How effective can that policeman be? Then, we come to arms and ammunition, what do the police have?\n\n\u201cAnd when it comes to modern equipment for combating criminality, how much of it do the police have? And the same thing goes for all other security agencies.\n\n\u201cThey are in South-south battling militants; they are in the Southeast battling IPOB; they are in North East battling Boko Haram and ISWAP and insurgents and they are in the North West battling bandits.\u201d\n\nHe, however, pointed out that, \u201cHere, the bandits have infiltrated the communities recruiting young men with as low as N5,000 along with drugs and other intoxicants. We must stop the culture of not reporting criminals, because of tribal or family affiliations.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Baba, who assured the governor of speedy prosecution of arrested bandits and kidnappers, said the Nigerian Police Force under his watch had commenced plans for the recruitment of additional 20,000 policemen across the 774 local government areas of the country.\n\n\u201cWe will recruit from every local government in the country. It is the directive of the President that we should recruit 10,000 for 2020 and another 10,000 for 2021 across all the 774 local government areas. We are going to redeploy these policemen to their local government areas to fight crime,\u201d said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI came in as IGP at a very difficult time. When I came in, it was in the South East and South-South that there were series of killings, including the killing of security personnel and our places of work destroyed.\n\n\u201cWhile the South-South and South East are stabilising, the situation in the North Central and the North West is getting worse. We are going to work harder to see that citizens go about their lawful businesses unmolested\u201d.\n\nHowever, in a statement by the Public Relations Officer, Zamfara Command, Superintendent Muhammad Shehu, the police said the ongoing search and rescue mission had started toyield positive result as Five (5) of the abducted female students were yesterday rescued.\n\nShehu noted that the victims were medically checked at the hospital, debriefed by the Police and had been reunited with their families.\n\nAccording to him, the Commissioner of Police, CP Ayuba N. Elkana, has assured the people that, the ongoing search and rescue effort would be sustained, so that the remaining abducted students would be rescued hale and hearty.\n\nMeanwhile, the Defence Headquarters, which disclosed that addition 900 more terrorists had surrendered to troops, said those that surrendered included Boko Haram commanders, fighters and their families.\n\nIt said 560 of them were handed over to Borno State government after \u201cthorough profiling\u201d even though 40 insurgents were killed while 20 others were arrested by troops.\n\nAlso, in a related development, troops of Operation Delta Safe have reportedly deactivated 33 illegal refining sites and 46 refining units in Imo, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and Delta States.\n\nAt a media briefing in Abuja, Director, Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko, said 900 more terrorists surrendered following intensified air interdiction and artillery bombardment of their enclaves by ground troops and the air force.\n\nHe said a total of 52 assorted arms and 1,977 rounds of 7.62mm assorted calibre ammunition including AK-47 and FN rifles with magazines, hand grenades, commando mortar guns, locally fabricated rifles, Dushka anti-aircraft guns, dane guns and Nigerian Police rifles among other items were recovered from them, while the operations held between August 12 and September 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe counter insurgency efforts of the troops through kinetic and non-kinetic operations compelled the terrorists to surrender in large numbers. Suffice to note that within the last few weeks, more than 5,890 terrorists comprising foot soldiers and their commanders have surrendered with their families to own troops in the North-east zone,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyeuko explained that a total of 565 Boko Haram terrorists comprising 12 commanders, their family members were handed over to the Borno State government in Maiduguri for further management after thorough profiling.\n\nSpeaking, also, on the Jos crisis, Onyeuko said troops of Operation Safe Haven had arrested 20 suspects allegedly involved in the attacks, which resulted in the killing of 26 travellers at Rukuba town in Jos North LGA of Plateau State.\n\nHe said the arrested persons had been handed over to the appropriate prosecuting agency for further necessary action, adding that the military had sustained its operations against armed bandits in the North-west within the period under review.\n\n\u201cTroops within the period arrested criminal informants/collaborators, whose activities have been causing setbacks for own troops\u2019 operations in the zone.\n\n\u201cA total of 15 armed bandits, two armed robbers were neutralised, 13 bandits informants arrested, 15 motorcycles were recovered, two AK 47 rifles recovered, 33 kidnap victims rescued, 66 criminal elements were arrested and some vandalised railway sleepers/tracks were recovered within the period in focus,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom the South-south, Operation Delta Safe claimed the raid on illegal refineries within the period of conducting series of anti-illegal oil operations, included such places as Opuoma and Mmahu communities in Ohaji-Egbema LGA of Imo State; Sand Community in Akwa Ibom State; Madangho Creek in Warri South West LGA, Ndoro and Beneside Communities in Burutu LGA as well as Yokri-Egbe Seashore, all in Delta State.\n\nOther operations were executed at Ibaa in Emohua LGA, Iyala, Buguma and Cawthorne Channel Creeks as well as Samkiri, Orutoru and Dema Abbey Communities, all in Rivers and Delta States.\n\n\u201cDuring the operations, troops discovered and deactivated a total of 33 illegal refining sites with 46 illegal refining units, 94 boiler ovens and nine reservoirs.\n\n\u201cAlso, a cumulative total of 139 metal storage tanks and 63 dugout pits, all laden with 440.2 barrels and 1,637,500litres of illegally refined AGO as well as 62.2 barrels and 572,000litres of stolen crude oil and shelter stations were discovered and treated accordingly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that other illegally refined products intercepted and immobilised were a wooden boat used for transportation of illegal oil products, 321 polythene bags, 16 drums and 15 jerry cans laden with illegally refined petroleum products.\n\nBrigadier-General Onyeuko said the Armed Forces of Nigeria remained steadfast in the fight against all forms of criminality in different parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe military high command appreciates the continuous sacrifices of the troops in the various theatres of operation across the country. It salutes their courage, resilience and commitment towards achieving sustainable peace in the country.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the general public and the press for their continued support and further encourage all to avail the armed forces with credible and timely information that will facilitate proactive engagements in all the theatres of operation across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday maintained that the existing price differential between the amount petrol is sold in Nigeria compared to its neighbouring countries remains a major incentive for smuggling of the commodity across the borders.\n\nA statement by the NNPC spokesman, Mr. Garba Muhammad, quoted the Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, to have said this during a presentation at an interactive session by the Joint Senate Committee on the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP).\n\nThe NNPC boss noted that concerted efforts by the corporation and some federal agencies to combat the menace of smuggling of petroleum products have been largely hampered by the current arbitrage situation.\n\nThe NNPC had always argued that the current fuel subsidy regime remains unsustainable, pointing out as of June this year, it was paying as much as between N120 billion and N140 billion every month, with about N94 under-recovery per litre at the time.\n\nWith the country unofficially supplying the needs of some of the neighbouring countries through smuggling, the volume of the product leaving the shores of the country and by extension subsidy paid by the NNPC has continued to increase.\n\nKyari said with price difference of over N100 per litre now existing between what is sold in Nigeria and in countries surrounding the nation, it was difficult to monitor the activities of petrol smugglers.\n\nThe NNPC GMD said though the corporation, working in concert with other agencies, has made noticeable progress in combating the menace, the battle was yet to be won.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is arbitrage between the price that you sell and what is obtainable elsewhere, you can be sure that it is very difficult to contain the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe emphasised that the activities of smugglers have also made it difficult for the country to determine the actual consumption figures for petrol, noting that the corporation can only know what was trucked out from loading depots across the country but cannot determine how much of that was consumed in-country.\n\nOn the MTEF assumptions, the GMD reiterated a base oil price scenario of $57 per barrel for 2022, $61 per barrel for 2023 and $62 per barrel for 2024. These were predicated on a base national production of 1.883 million barrels per day in 2022, 2.234 million barrels per day in 2023 and 2.218 million barrels per day in 2024.\n\nKyari explained that the assumptions were arrived at after consultations with the ministry of finance and other relevant stakeholders, while also undertaking a careful appraisal of the three-year historical dated Brent oil price average of $59.07 per barrel premised on Platts Spot Prices among other considerations.\n\nHe reiterated that price growth was to be moderated by the lingering concerns over COVID-19, increased energy efficiency as well as obvious switching due to increased utilisation of gas and alternatives for electricity generation.\n\nThe Senate Committee session was chaired by Senator Solomon Adeola, with members drawn from the Committees on Finance, National Planning as well as foreign and local debts.\n\nOther members of the committee were drawn from banking, insurance, and other financial institutions, petroleum resources upstream as well as downstream petroleum sector and gas.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Fintech Focus: The link between Open Banking and financial inclusion",
          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How customer loyalty is helping Nigerian fintech apps through regulatory crackdown",
          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Telecom operators will implement new SIM card registration procedures. The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA), Rwanda\u2019s telecom regulator, claims it will help reduce fraud.\n\nAccording to RURA, anyone who wants to get or swap a SIM card must do so at their telco\u2019s service centres, authorised agent shops, or kiosks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles Gahungu, General Manager, ICT Regulation Department, RURA, said the new procedure would improve SIM card security because it will include ID verification and photographing people buying or swapping SIM cards.\n\nWhat did the old procedure entail?\n\nSIM cards were only registered and activated after verifying that the National ID number presented by a potential buyer exists. Consequently, customer\u2019s SIM cards were registered using their IDs without their knowledge.\n\nWhat\u2019s changing? Before swapping or registering a SIM card under this new procedure, service providers must confirm that the National ID presented is the same as in the National Identification Agency\u2019s database. But that\u2019s not all. They now have to go a step further and match the face from the Agency\u2019s database to the person at their office, thus finally verifying ownership.\n\nBecause RURA can now track SIM card owners, this new procedure promises to help curb fraudulent acts like mobile money scams.\n\nAccording to George Kagabo, MTN\u2019s General Manager of Internal Audit and Forensics, the telecommunications company has registered seven cases of fraud this year stemming from unauthorised SIM swaps.\n\nSomalia launches Trade Information Portal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Somalia has developed a Trade Information Portal with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to reduce costs and simplify trade procedures for Somali importers and exporters.\n\nWhat does this mean? Traders now have access to over 90 laws, regulations, procedures, and other trade-related measures from most of Somalia\u2019s government agencies. Also, African businesses can find out the applicable fees for obtaining licences and permits, all of which can be done on the website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy should you care? The portal is expected to significantly improve the country\u2019s business environment and attract foreign and domestic investors.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Trade Information Portal will help the Somali business community find needed information to facilitate their import-export activities. Also, traders will have easy access to information on Somalia\u2019s import and export regulations and procedures.\n\nExpectations? Cross-border trade between Somalia and its neighbour is expected to increase following the launch of the Trade Information Portal.\n\nCellulant partners with GAINDE 2000 to improve Africa\u2019s trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan payments company, Cellulant, has entered a five-year partnership with GAINDE 2000, a Senegal-based trade facilitation systems provider, to provide end-to-end infrastructure and payments solutions for governments and multinationals.\n\nHow will it happen? GAINDE 2000 will combine its e-government solutions with Cellulant\u2019s payment solutions to provide a comprehensive regional end-to-end technology and payments solution in Africa.\n\nWhat will the partnership offer? It will provide a digital payments platform to assist governments in improving their trade environment and meeting the challenges of payments and modern customs administration by reducing time and cost in trade transactions.\n\nWhy GAINDE 2000? The Senegalese company has a wide range of functionalities and allows traders and shipping companies to submit customs declarations online. Its primary business has evolved into the design, implementation, and operation of digital platforms for governments and businesses.\n\nTingg, a single digital payments platform provided by Cellulant, will address the complex payment needs of both governments and businesses.\n\nTingg makes it easy to collect and make payments using a variety of payment methods and currencies, connecting thousands of businesses with 154 payment options in 35 countries.\n\nDaniel SARR, Regional Executive Director of GAINDE 2000, says the partnership with Cellulant is not only a milestone in their journey to facilitate trade formalities, but it also represents a dramatic shift for the future of financial trade-related transactions, security operations, and human-driven applications.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nBuilding Shopify for Africa, Nigeria\u2019s Bumpa plans to digitise thousands of African businesses\n\nExperts explain how founders can strategically avoid the pitfalls of business partnerships\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nApple will ask before it targets you with its ads in iOS 15.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian eCommerce startup, Bumpa, has raised a $200,000 pre-seed to digitise thousands of African businesses on its platform.\n\nGreencap Equity, HoaQ club, Rizq Investment Group, Microtraction, DFS Lab, Aidi Ventures, Prosper Otemuyiwa, Oo Nwoye, Perfect Makanju, Whogohost\u2019s venture arm, and a few other angel investors took part in the round.\n\nBumpa, formerly known as SalesCabal, was relaunched in February 2021 by Kelvin Umechukwu (CEO) and Adetunji Opayele (CTO). The company helps retailers manage and grow their businesses using their smartphones.\n\nFrom a side project to a full-time project\n\nUmechukwu and Opayele met in 2013 as students at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. They were part of the schools\u2019 tech community, building different products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter school, Opayele founded HostCabal, a company that helps small businesses host their businesses online. And in 2018, Umechukwu joined him as a business developer, albeit as a side gig.\n\n\u201cAfter we built it, we noticed that a lot of businesses were coming online. So rather than building websites for individual businesses, we decided to automate the process. That\u2019s how it began as a side project,\u201d Umechukwu explains to Techpoint Africa.\n\nBecause of the economic impact of COVID-19 in 2020, Opayele was confident that the product was ready for launch.\n\n\u201cBefore 2020, it was difficult to move businesses online. So the idea was to figure out how to get businesses online because they were completely offline and lacked the resources to digitise their operations. That was how we began building SalesCabal, not Bumpa,\u201d Umechukwu explains.\n\nIn May 2021, Umechukwu began working full-time at Bumpa with Opayele.\n\nBumpa helps merchants grow their businesses online\n\nThe startup, which Umechukwu calls \u201cShopify for Africa,\u201d assists merchants and businesses in moving their operations online. It allows merchants with no technical skills and experience to set up their eCommerce store using their smartphones.\n\nAdditionally, Bumpa merchants can use their smartphones to accept online and offline payments, manage inventory/products, handle bookkeeping, fulfil orders, track sales, request dispatch riders, easily engage customers, and much more.\n\nWhile Umechukwu attributes the successful round to having the right team and supportive investors who recognise value, he believes that with the financing, many small businesses will thrive as they leverage technology for business growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowth and expansion\n\nThe startup claims to have onboarded over 7,000 merchants on its platform in the past six months, with a 50% month-on-month (MoM) growth rate. Bumpa also says that merchants have listed more than 30,000 products and completed over $500,000 in recorded transactions.\n\nThe startup is looking to provide more small business owners with tools to help them grow their businesses and hopes to reach 200,000 merchants by 2022.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand its operations and onboard more merchants on its platform.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are not looking at driving into other countries operationally until 2022. We still have a lot to capture here in Nigeria,\u201d Umechukwu says.\n\nBumpa will also expand its team and introduce new features to improve merchant support as it seeks to help its customers increase their sales by at least 20% MoM.\n\n\u201cBumpa was built primarily for emerging markets. We are also looking at expanding into Latin America, South Asia, and other continents. Those places will be our next big markets,\u201d Opayele reveals.\n\nAccording to Statista, over two billion people purchased goods or services online in 2020, revealing eCommerce\u2019s importance to the global retail framework.\n\nHowever, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report titled \u201cCOVID-19 and e-commerce: a global review,\u201d Africa only accounted for less than 3% of global eCommerce activities in 2020.\n\nBut, as we discussed in this article, online shopping could become a bigger deal in Africa in the coming years. And Bumpa believes that less technologically savvy merchants shouldn\u2019t be left behind as they account for a greater proportion of Africa\u2019s small businesses.\n\nThe co-founders, therefore, believe that small businesses will grow if offered Bumpa as a solution product.\n\n\u201cWe see ourselves playing a key role in how African businesses will grow. A large part of the market isn\u2019t technologically savvy, so we are trying to create a product for non-tech savvy people,\u201d Opayele concludes.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe past few years have been interesting for SMEs in major African countries. E-commerce companies have popped up, making previously challenging service delivery easy to accomplish, even without physical meetings.\n\nPrudence*, a civil servant who runs a business on the side selling soft drinks in bulk, used to deliver packages to customers with her car. However, this delivery model was unsustainable and she needed an extra hand.\n\nFollowing a recommendation, she got a tricycle rider to handle dispatches to customers at rates less than what logistics companies would typically charge. But not long after, he went off the radar with goods for delivery. Prudence counted her losses and went in search of another dispatch rider.\n\nPrudence\u2019s story \u2014 a true one, I should add \u2014 is only a simple example of what can go wrong in a business partnership. A study shows that 70% of business partnerships fail and 90% of startups ultimately fail in the first 10 years mainly because of bad partnerships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite their role in startup failure, partnerships are crucial to the running of a business \u2014 all the more so when the business is a startup \u2014 because these relationships help companies have a robust offering and improve their service delivery.\n\nAfrican tech angel investor, Zachariah George, believes that \u201cit is actually hard for startups in Africa to scale without entering partnerships, especially with corporates.\u201d\n\nA major telemedicine startup, for instance, would have to partner with a network of doctors and pharmacies whose poor performances could negatively impact the startup.\n\nIs partnership a necessary evil?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge is the Managing Partner at early-stage venture capital firm, Launch Africa Ventures, and the Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of StartupBootcamp Africa \u2014 an accelerator. His viewpoint about creating value for portfolio startups is that connecting startups with relevant industry players is more important than raising funds for them.\n\nExplaining the important role that partnerships play in a startup\u2019s growth to Techpoint Africa, he makes it clear that entering a business relationship is more important than raising funds, and partnership decisions should be made early in a startup\u2019s lifecycle.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that anyone can raise money, and raising money doesn\u2019t make you more valuable. You need to be able to execute on your business irrespective of whether you\u2019re a B2B or B2C. Ultimately, you need to be able to generate revenue.\u201d\n\nSince raising money is easy, startups can only position themselves as valuable without the funds by showing potential for commercial traction. A startup with strategic agreements in place to address customer acquisition, for instance, has more potential when promising recurring revenue to an investor.\n\n\u201cAs a world-class accelerator, our first point of call is how we can help startups to begin generating revenue. We need to ensure that they can sign contracts, do proof of concepts, carry out pilots, commercial agreements and licence deals with insurance companies, telcos, retailer banks, and manufacturing firms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you can create value. And if you can justify that contract is in place, then you can go to investors to say \u2018I have a proof of concept with this insurer or bank, now I can raise money and I know the cost of delivering on this contract.'\u201d\n\nIn other words, partnerships are meant to add value.\n\nNigerian healthtech startup, WellaHealth, has a network of over 1,400 pharmacies. And according to Olanrewaju Akintobi, WellaHealth\u2019s Business Development Manager, \u201cpartnership is a key means to grow and also extend value to the last mile. We have seen tremendous value dissemination in terms of symbiotic partnership across board.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s easier said than done.\n\nIn considering a partnership, Omoniyi Kolade, Founder of pan-African payments startup, SeerBit, says the brand has to go through a rigorous partner selection process.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to find agreement terms that are favourable and within the business\u2019s capacity to commit/deliver, to ensure customer satisfaction, and also avoid reputational damage in the market.\u201d\n\nAvoiding subtle traps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying safe in startup-partnership waters means answering some questions.\n\nHow does one make the best choice when considering a partnership? Which partnerships are likely to be productive?\n\nWhatever answers they provide, Kolade and Akintobi agree that partnerships must be based on aligned values.\n\nA good example is a business owner whose elaborate long-term plans are far removed from a prospective partner\u2019s short-term financial goals.\n\nAccording to Kolade, SeerBit has gotten it right since launching in 2019, with no tales of woe because the business looks out for \u201creputable partners that are strategically aligned with our vision, strategic needs, and interests.\u201d\n\nThis means partners must be interested in SeerBit\u2019s mission to solve the problem of fragmented payment in Africa.\n\nHe adds that a partner must be armed with the infrastructural capability and experience to meet the terms of the agreement.\n\nAkintobi holds similar views and says, \u201cOur partners are registered businesses, our pharmacy partners are registered with PCN. While our distribution partners are registered companies who share our beliefs and values.\u201d\n\nApart from mutual interest and credibility, other partnership issues include financial agreement and quality of service.\n\nSuccessful partnerships are the result of all parties pulling their weight, and if one party makes a greater financial commitment than the other, the relationship might be heading for the rocks. Unless, of course, that is one of the terms of the partnership agreement.\n\nCases where one partner wants to be paid back for unquantifiable efforts \u2014 like sweat equity \u2014 present problems, especially in short-term agreements, since there will be no compensation if there are no profits. This does not always have to be an issue if the contract clearly articulates how to measure the sweat equity.\n\nSome contracts have an exclusivity clause restricting startups from entering other partnerships for the duration of the contract. George\u2019s take on this is that staying away from partnerships requiring exclusivity is a healthy move for startups. But he advises that where necessary, it should range between six and twelve months.\n\nAs Kolade points out, when potential partners tick all the right boxes, presenting vague agreement terms is still a huge red flag. If the agreement is not flexible and transparent \u2014 profit sharing formula also \u2014 it is a shady deal.\n\nIn the search of partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge\u2019s years of experience connecting startups to the right partners in startup-corporate partnerships have helped him develop an approach that works.\n\n\u201cIt is more like reverse engineering. Instead of startups pitching to the corporate sector, we look for problems that startups can help them solve. We consider what the corporate sector struggles with and then we find a way for a startup to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nPaying attention to the mutual benefits is key, but Kolade posits that \u201cpartnerships can also be experiments in which you learn and tweak partnership strategies. There are no hard and fast rules on what kind of partnerships businesses like ours can pursue.\u201d\n\nFor context, as a payments processing platform \u2014 with typical partners like banks, payment switches, and card schemes such as Visa and Mastercard \u2014 SeerBit looks to partner with non-financial businesses serving the same market.\n\nWellaHealth on the other hand, as a healthtech startup, can find partnerships with a mobility company or a payments company, or vice versa. Ultimately, as Akintobi states, partners must be \u201ckeen on improving healthcare outcomes in Africa and drive products to the last mile while giving value to their offerings.\u201d\n\nTo avoid sad partnership stories, parties must enter into their relationships with a great degree of trust for each other, which can only result from honesty on both sides. While businesses may never be able to predict how partners will eventually conduct themselves, bad outcomes can be mitigated with the \u2018due diligence\u2019 this piece clearly outlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",

          "text": "Some governors in Nigeria\u2019s troubled Northern region are closing markets, shuttering highways, prohibiting sale of petrol in cans, restricting movement of cattle and urging people to defend themselves to curb banditry and terrorism plaguing their states, measures indicating they are at their wit\u2019s end.\n\nThis is worsened by a Constitution that puts control of soldiers and policemen in states under the control of a president in Abuja, who often does not know what is going on in the states.\n\nAminu Masari, governor, Katsina State (North Western), has ordered the closure of Jibia-Gurbin Baure and Kankara-Sheme roads gateways to the states commercial cities to all motorists until further notice.\n\nMasari has also ordered all commercial vehicles, tricycles and motorcycles off every road in the state from 10pm to 6am in the state capital of Katsina, and 6pm to 6am in other local government areas in last ditch efforts to curb rural banditry.\n\nLast week, murderous gangs riding in hundreds of motorcycles invaded Duba, a community in Batsari Local Government Area of the state, killing a dozen people and injuring several others.\n\nAccording to Masari, in 10 out of the 34 local government areas, the word of criminals is law. In July, he told the youths in the state to defend themselves with catapults against AK-47 wielding marauders. Nigeria\u2019s president hails from Katsina.\n\nState executives in Nigeria\u2019s Northern region are running out of ideas to contain what began as an insurgency by an extremist religious sect, Boko Haram, following the execution of its leader Mohammed Yusuf, to what is now low-grade warfare against the Nigerian state by terrorists and bandits.\n\nIn this warfare, children are fair game, women are spoils and terror is the prize. It is a war where it is often difficult to tell the enemy apart, where the generals double as saboteurs, and where every conquest looks too similar to bruising defeat.\n\nIn Zamfara, Governor Bello Matawalle has opened a backchannel to start peace talks with the terrorists, a capitulation, dressed as negotiation.\n\nRead also: Agric growth lowest since 2018 as insecurity takes toll on farming\n\n\u201cWe applied the peace accord as a means of an honest solution to the problem in Zamfara State, which has yielded tremendous results never expected in the last one year,\u201d Matawalle said recently.\n\nGovernors in the North have offered cash to home-grown terrorists and bandits, shuttered major highways, ordered curfews, paid soldiers and local vigilantes to go after them, but the killings continue.\n\n\u201cRural banditry in the northwestern states of Zamfara, Kaduna and Katsina has reached alarming heights in recent years. They have actually settled in Zamfara State, setting up fortified enclaves in the hinterland and on the frontiers, from where they plot and carry out their operations,\u201d Chukwuma Al Okoli, lecturer at the Department of Political Science, Federal University Lafia, noted in a research.\n\nAccording to a tally by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based research firm, over 3,000 people were killed between April and June, and nearly 300 security officials were killed in the same period.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Northern region is fast morphing into killing fields as marauding gangs armed with military-grade weapons pillage communities, raid farms, rape women and abduct children. It is the Wild Wild West on steroids, a return to the state of nature, which English philosopher Thomas Hobbes described as \u2018solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\u2019\n\nThe pervasive insecurity has unravelled the local economy, caused massive unemployment, as investors flee the region and throngs of young people flee the region on the back of trucks to become water vendors in Lagos.\n\nPoliticians who impoverish the region have long kept the people ignorant, docile and pliable with the aid of clerics. A generation of uneducated youths that were used to steal elections and foment mayhem have grown up with little else to do than get high on glue and wield guns for any cause that comes with a meal.\n\n\u201cGovernments at all levels must present governance as a more attractive option to their youths than what armed groups and other non-state actors present as a means of recruiting from a pool of unemployed people,\u201d said Confidence McHarry, a security analyst at SBM Intelligence, a geopolitical intelligence platform, based in Lagos.\n\nThe solution, according to McHarry, is to fix the economy. According to data released by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria\u2019s GDP grew 5.01 percent when compared with the same quarter last year.\n\n\u201cBut that growth could have been much higher had the government not embarked on obnoxious policies such as the border closure, foreign exchange restrictions and import bans among several others. The inability of young people to find work is fuelling insecurity,\u201d said McHarry.\n\nZainab Ahmed, Nigeria\u2019s finance minister said the second-quarter growth of 2021 would have been much stronger than the 5.01 percent, but for agriculture, that recorded a slightly lower growth. A number of bottlenecks within the system, including insecurity, negatively affected the sector, she said.\n\nBandits have chased farmers away from their lands, set fire to harvests, rustled cattle and abducted young people to fuel their ranks. This partly accounts for food inflation at 22 percent, putting basic food items out of the reach of many Nigerians.\n\n\u201cGoing further, it also needs to improve its intelligence gathering capability \u2013 massive investments in human and signals intelligence \u2013 as a means of forestalling attacks.\n\n\u201cSo far, military operations in the North have not targeted the kingpins of the major armed groups. There\u2019s a feeling that the government does not want to rock the boat and is thus content with sporadic air raids,\u201d noted McHarry.\n\nThis timid counter-terrorism approach has produced ineffectual results. It has spread from the North East to North West and is fast morphing into an industry becoming difficult to tell apart bandits from terrorists.\n\nThis is markedly different from the counter-terrorism approach of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which focus efforts on three main areas: awareness, capabilities and engagement.\n\nThey promote shared awareness of the terrorist threat through consultations, enhanced intelligence-sharing and continuous strategic analysis and assessment, according to NATO guidelines.\n\nAdequate capabilities are built to prevent, protect against and respond to terrorist threats. Personnel and tools are provided to address asymmetric threats, including terrorism and the use of non-conventional weapons to protect troops, civilians and critical infrastructure against attacks perpetrated by terrorist\n\nThey also engage with allies to strengthen outreach and cooperation with partner countries and international actors.\n\nAnalysts say these are missing links in Nigeria\u2019s engagement with terrorists.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government says it is making provision for the controversial fuel subsidy as part of its expenditure in the 2022 budget.\n\nThis is according to the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari.\n\nThis is even as President Muhammadu Buhari has signed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), with the government planning to deregulate the downstream sector.\n\nThe federal government is projecting N900 billion for fuel subsidy for 2022.\n\nMr Kyari spoke on Thursday at MTEF/FSP hearing organised by the Senate Committee on Finance in Abuja.\n\nThis revelation comes amidst unresolved issues between the federal government and the organised labour on the implementation of the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil industry, Premium Times reported.\n\nThe government had in March 2020, announced an end to the fuel subsidy regime and the immediate deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry amid a global oil price crash. The process was later suspended earlier this year to allow for consultation with stakeholders and organised labour.\n\nThe medium had reported how the nation may be expending over N102.5 billion monthly to reduce the retail cost of petrol \u2013 a sum higher than the N70 billion budgeted for the provision of Universal Basic Education (UBEC) in the 2021 budget, as well as the N45.19 billion allocated for immunisation.\n\nIn its defence, the federal government had said there was need \u201cto be considerate to Nigerians and implement structures to help reduce the price of petrol, hence the subsidy.\u201d\n\nIt also comes despite promises made by the State Minister for Petroleum, Timipre Sylvia, that petrol subsidy will be removed after the Petroleum Industry Bill (now an Act) is signed.\n\nWhile many Nigerians have called for the removal of subsidy in order to enable the government to invest the fund in other developmental projects, others have condemned such calls, citing it as perhaps one of the few \u201cbenefits\u201d the masses enjoy from the government. And also because it is not included in the annual budget, according to Premium Times.\n\nSome groups, including the Nigeria Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress, have advised the government to fix the refineries before removing fuel subsidy.\n\nMr Kyari told lawmakers that although no provision was made for fuel subsidy in 2021, \u201cthe government had begun a conversation with relevant stakeholders to exit the subsidy regime and the process may not be concluded anytime soon, hence the need to reintroduce subsidy in the 2022 budget.\u201d\n\nWith this revelation, it is unclear how the NNPC intends to solve issues of unremitted revenue\n\nThe agency had in April, blamed its non-remittance on costs incurred from subsidy payments on petrol.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is an ongoing process that is engaging members of the organised labour, civil society organisations and many other institutions of government and other critical stakeholders to arrive at a landing on how and when we can exit the subsidy regime to be very precise.\n\n\u201cThe government is not sure that it can conclude the process of exiting the subsidy regime before the end of 2021 or early 2022, hence the provision of fuel subsidy in the 2022 Appropriation bill,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Kyari further said the NNPC pays between N100 and 120 billion monthly to keep the pump price of petrol at N162 per litre and that the agency is sustaining imports to avert scarcity.\n\nKyari had blamed the agency\u2019s non-remittance of revenue on smuggling, round-tripping and other sharp practices.\n\nThe lawmakers, however, issued stern warnings about revenue generation which they said, will curb the habit of borrowing to fund the budget.\n\nThe Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) sets parameters with which the budget is prepared, including the borrowing plan of the government.\n\nIt proposes $57 per barrel as crude price for 2022, $61 per barrel for 2023 and $62 per barrel for 2024 predicated on a base national production of 1.883 million barrels per day in 2022, 2.234 million barrels per day in 2023 and 2.218 million barrels per day in 2024, Premium Times reported.",

          "text": "Africa is likely to miss the urgent global goal of vaccinating the most vulnerable 10 per cent of each country\u2019s population against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) by the end of September, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nThe WHO Regional Office for Africa in a statement released on Thursday said that 42 of Africa\u2019s 54 nations (nearly 80 per cent) are set to miss the target with the current pace of vaccine deliveries and vaccinations.\n\nNine African countries, including South Africa, Morocco, and Tunisia, have already reached the global target set in May by the World Health Assembly, the world\u2019s highest health policy-setting body.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the current pace, three more African countries are set to meet the target, while two more could meet it if they speed up vaccinations.\n\nMatshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa said, \u201cWith less than a month to go, this looming goal must concentrate minds in Africa and globally.\n\n\u201cVaccine hoarding has held Africa back and we urgently need more vaccines.\n\n\u201cBut as more doses arrive, African countries must zero in and drive forward precise plans to rapidly vaccinate the millions of people that still face a grave threat from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAlmost 21 million COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Africa via the COVAX Facility in August, an amount equal to the previous four months combined.\n\nWith more vaccines expected from COVAX and the African Union by the end of September, Africa would have enough doses to meet the 10 per cent target, Moeti said.\n\nWhile many African countries have sped up COVID-19 vaccinations as vaccine shipments ramped up in August, 26 countries have used less than half of their COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMore than 143 million doses have been received in Africa in total, but only 39 million people \u2013 around just 3 per cent of Africa\u2019s population \u2013 are fully vaccinated.\n\nIn comparison, 52 per cent of people are fully vaccinated in the United States and 57 per cent in the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe inequity is deeply disturbing. Just 2 per cent of the more than five billion doses given globally have been administered in Africa.\n\n\u201cYet recent rises in vaccine shipments and commitments shows that a fairer, more just global distribution of vaccines looks possible,\u201d Moeti said.\n\nAccording to WHO, COVID-19 cases are declining slightly in Africa but remain stubbornly high.\n\nA rising number of new cases in Central, East and West Africa pushed case numbers up to nearly 215,000 in the week ending on Aug. 29, and 25 countries are reporting high or fast-rising case numbers, with over 5,500 deaths.\n\n\u201cAlthough Africa\u2019s third wave peaked in July, the decline in new cases is at a glacial pace \u2013 far slower than in previous waves.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is still raging in Africa and we must not let our guard down,\u201d said Moeti.\n\nThe highly transmissible Delta variant has been found in 31 African countries.\n\nThe Alpha variant has been detected in 44 countries, and the Beta variant in 39.\n\nThe C.1.2 variant has been identified in 114 cases in South Africa.\n\nSingle cases have been found in four other African countries, and very low case numbers have been reported internationally.\n\nWhile first reported to WHO in July, the prevalence of this new variant remains very low.\n\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring the spread and evolution of all reported variants of COVID-19, including C.1.2.\n\n\u201cMask wearing, physical distancing, and regular hand washing will help keep you safe from all variants,\u201d Moeti said.

          "text": "Africa is likely to miss the urgent global goal of vaccinating the most vulnerable 10 per cent of each country\u2019s population against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) by the end of September, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nThe WHO Regional Office for Africa in a statement released on Thursday said that 42 of Africa\u2019s 54 nations (nearly 80 per cent) are set to miss the target with the current pace of vaccine deliveries and vaccinations.\n\nNine African countries, including South Africa, Morocco, and Tunisia, have already reached the global target set in May by the World Health Assembly, the world\u2019s highest health policy-setting body.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the current pace, three more African countries are set to meet the target, while two more could meet it if they speed up vaccinations.\n\nMatshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa said, \u201cWith less than a month to go, this looming goal must concentrate minds in Africa and globally.\n\n\u201cVaccine hoarding has held Africa back and we urgently need more vaccines.\n\n\u201cBut as more doses arrive, African countries must zero in and drive forward precise plans to rapidly vaccinate the millions of people that still face a grave threat from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAlmost 21 million COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Africa via the COVAX Facility in August, an amount equal to the previous four months combined.\n\nWith more vaccines expected from COVAX and the African Union by the end of September, Africa would have enough doses to meet the 10 per cent target, Moeti said.\n\nWhile many African countries have sped up COVID-19 vaccinations as vaccine shipments ramped up in August, 26 countries have used less than half of their COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMore than 143 million doses have been received in Africa in total, but only 39 million people \u2013 around just 3 per cent of Africa\u2019s population \u2013 are fully vaccinated.\n\nIn comparison, 52 per cent of people are fully vaccinated in the United States and 57 per cent in the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe inequity is deeply disturbing. Just 2 per cent of the more than five billion doses given globally have been administered in Africa.\n\n\u201cYet recent rises in vaccine shipments and commitments shows that a fairer, more just global distribution of vaccines looks possible,\u201d Moeti said.\n\nAccording to WHO, COVID-19 cases are declining slightly in Africa but remain stubbornly high.\n\nA rising number of new cases in Central, East and West Africa pushed case numbers up to nearly 215,000 in the week ending on Aug. 29, and 25 countries are reporting high or fast-rising case numbers, with over 5,500 deaths.\n\n\u201cAlthough Africa\u2019s third wave peaked in July, the decline in new cases is at a glacial pace \u2013 far slower than in previous waves.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is still raging in Africa and we must not let our guard down,\u201d said Moeti.\n\nThe highly transmissible Delta variant has been found in 31 African countries.\n\nThe Alpha variant has been detected in 44 countries, and the Beta variant in 39.\n\nThe C.1.2 variant has been identified in 114 cases in South Africa.\n\nSingle cases have been found in four other African countries, and very low case numbers have been reported internationally.\n\nWhile first reported to WHO in July, the prevalence of this new variant remains very low.\n\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring the spread and evolution of all reported variants of COVID-19, including C.1.2.\n\n\u201cMask wearing, physical distancing, and regular hand washing will help keep you safe from all variants,\u201d Moeti said.

Nigerian police have to be questioned. Justice must be served. Oh Akpan. The only son to his parent. So after they have killed you, they realised that they arrested the wrong person.

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) Thursday said a total of 5,890 Boko Haram terrorists comprising foot soldiers, their commanders and family members have surrendered to troops of Operation HADIN KAI in the North-east.\n\nThe DHQ also said 565 out of the surrendered terrorists, comprising 3 commanders, four Amirs, five Nakibs and five cattle rustling specialists, and their family members were handed over to the Borno State Government after thorough profiling.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations (DMO) Brig-Gen. Benard Onyeuko stated this while briefing journalists on the update of various military operations from August 12- September 2, 2021 in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cWithin the period under review, troops of Operation HADIN KAI sustained their operations to terrorists in the North-east theatre. The counter insurgency efforts of the troops through kinetic and non-kinetic operations compelled the terrorists to surrender in large numbers.\n\n\u201cSuffice to note that, within the last few weeks, more than 5,890 terrorists comprising foot soldiers and their commanders have surrendered with their families to own troops in the North-east Zone. A total of 565 BHT\u2019s comprising 3 Commanders, 4 Amirs, 5 Nakibs and 5 cattle rustling specialists, out of the surrendered BHTs and their family members were handed over to the Borno state Government in Maiduguri for further management after thorough profiling.\u201d\n\nOnyeuko said during the period under review, troops of operation HADARIN DAJI in the North-west rescued 33 kidnap victims, while 15 armed bandits were killed and 13 bandits\u2019 informants arrested.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, a total of 15 armed bandits and 2 armed robbers were neutralized, 13 bandits informants arrested, 15 motorcycles were recovered, 2 AK 47 rifles recovered, 33 kidnap victims rescued, 66 criminal elements arrested and some vandalized railway sleepers/tracks were recovered within the period in focus.\n\n\u201cThe operations that led to the significant results were carried out at Gidan Zuma village under Kwatarkwashi District and Bakinwa in Gusau LGA, Matuzgi and Gora Namaye village in Maradun LGA of Zamfara state, and along Gurbi \u2013 Shimfida Road in Jibia LGA of Katsina state.\n\n\u201cOther locations where significant results were recorded include, Magam village in Tangaza LGA of Sokoto state, Faskari Town and Batsari/Ruma general area in Batsari LGA and Jibia town in Jibia LGA of Katsina state,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyeuko reiterated the commitment of the Armed Force (AFN) towards ending all forms of criminalities confronting the nation.\n\nHe said the AFN \u201cremains steadfast in the fight against all forms of criminality in different parts of the country.\u201d\n\nArmy neutralises ISWAP members\n\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Army said its troops successfully killed six members of the Islamic State West Africa (ISWAP) in gun battles.\n\nArmy spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu, stated this in a statement Thursday in Abuja.\n\nNwachukwu said the terrorists were killed in two different locations by two of its formations.\n\n\u201cTroops of 25 Brigade operating under the aegis of Joint Task Force, North East, Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) have neutralised 4 terrorists of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) on Wednesday 31 August 2021.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists who were on espionage along Damboa-Bulabulin- Maiduguri road ran into a fighting patrol team at Kukawa and were neutralised in the fire fight that ensued with the troops.\n\n\u201cOn further exploitation after the encounter, the gallant troops recovered from the terrorists, four AK 47 rifles and four Magazines, each loaded with 30 rounds of 7.62mm (Special) ammunition,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt also said two other terrorists were eliminated by the troops of 195 Battalion, Sector 1 OPHK in conjunction with elements of Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) at Dusman-Muna Garage.\n\nNwachukwu said: \u201cIn a separate operation, troops of 195 Battalion, Sector 1 OPHK in conjunction with elements of Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) at Dusman-Muna Garage, Borno state have eliminated two ISWAP terrorists in an ambush operation conducted along an identified ISWAP terrorists\u2019 crossing point at Musari village. The troops also captured and destroyed an ISWAP logistics vehicle conveying assorted goods and contraband items belonging to members of the terrorist group.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a separate operation, troops of 195 Battalion, Sector 1 OPHK in conjunction with elements of Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) at Dusman-Muna Garage, Borno state have eliminated two ISWAP terrorists in an ambush operation conducted along an identified ISWAP terrorists\u2019 crossing point at Musari village.\n\n\u201cThe troops also captured and destroyed an ISWAP logistics vehicle conveying assorted goods and contraband items belonging to members of the terrorist group. Items recovered by troops from the terrorists\u2019 vehicle are two bags of Hemp (Cannabis Sativa), 2 bags of Detergent,120 packets of mosquito coils, l2 mosquito nets and five textile materials. Other items recovered are two bycicles, two bags of beans, a bag of corn and some quantity of fish.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya has commended the troops for their operational exploits and urged them to\n\nmaintain the aggressive posture in order to decisively root out the terrorists from their enclaves,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFCT Police nabs 2 \u2018kidnappers\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the FCT Police Command has arrested one Musa Mukailu, 18, and one Damina Wali, 17, suspected to be kidnappers along Kwali axis of the FCT.\n\nA statement Thursday in Abuja by the acting Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for the command, ASP Daniel Ndirpaya said: \u201d The suspects who confessed to being members of a kidnapping syndicate met their waterloo while trying to kidnap two women along Kwali axis of the FCT.\n\n\u201cThey were arrested by operatives of the Commands anti-kidnapping section while on routine patrol. Effort is in place to arrest other members of the syndicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Command pledges its undeterred resolve to ensure lives and properties of residents within the FCT are protected. FCT residents are urged to report all suspicious movements, emergency or distress, through these numbers: 08032003913, 08061581938, 07057337653 and 08028940883.\n\n\u201cFor commendation or report on the conduct of police officers, call the Public Complaint Bureau (PCB) Line: 09022222352. Comments and observations can be dropped in any of the police suggestion boxes located at Berger Roundabouts, Area 1 Roundabouts and Federal Secretariat.\u201d\n\nMasari charges IGP\n\nMeanwhile, Katsina state Governor Aminu Bello Masari has tasked the Nigerian Police to take the war to the bandits and eliminate their leaders.\n\nMasari stated this Thursday while receiving the Inspector-General of police, Alhaji Usman Alkali Baba who paid him a courtesy call at the Government House Katsina.\n\nHe said the elimination of the bandits\u2019 leaders would send clear messages to their foot soldiers and boost the people\u2019s morale.\n\n\u201cThese leaders are known, their hideouts known, they even appear on social media boasting about their criminal exploit. This makes it easier for the security to reach them and eliminate them,\u201d the governor added.\n\nHe also urged security agencies to fully embrace the use of technology in fighting banditry and other criminalities, noting \u201dyou don\u2019t have the number to cover everywhere, therefore the use of technology will cover the gap.\u201d\n\nThe governor revealed that the state had initiated the third tier security initiative to involve people at the grassroots for security at the community level across the state.\n\nHe, however, lamented the havoc caused by the activities of informants who, according to him, aided the bandits and other criminals in attacking the people and kidnapping them.\n\n\u201cMost people in the community know everyone and can therefore easily identify criminals in their domain. Help the security by providing credible information on crimes\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, IGP Baba had said the Police recruited 10,000 in 2020 and would be recruiting same number in 2021 to boost the fight against criminals.\n\nHe commended the Katsina state government for its support to security personnel, especially the police operating in the state.\n\nEl-Rufai orders on livestock ban\n\nAlso, Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai has ordered a ban on transportation of livestock from the state to other states of the country, as well as transportation of livestock into the state.\n\nThe transport ban follows the ban on felling of trees for commercial purposes in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Igabi, Kajuru, Kauru and Kachia local government areas and selling of fuel in containers across five local governments of Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Igabi and Kajuru in the state.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan announced this in a statement Thursday.\n\nHe said the earlier ban on felling and transportation of trees, selling of petrol in jerry cans in the seven local government areas were still in force.\n\n\u201cAfter wide consultations and thorough security reviews, the Kaduna state government has banned the transportation of livestock from the state to other states in the country. This ban also prohibits the transportation of livestock into Kaduna state from other states. Both bans take effect immediately, from today 2nd September 2021.\n\n\u201cThe government also wishes to reiterate that the transportation of donkeys into the state is a criminal offence and anyone found engaging in this will be prosecuted accordingly. Furthermore, the Kawo weekly market which usually holds every Tuesday in Kaduna North LGA has been suspended with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cThe government of Kaduna state wishes to highlight that the previous directives suspending weekly markets, and selling of petrol in jerrycans in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Igabi and Kajuru LGAs, as well as banning the felling of trees for timber, firewood and charcoal and other commercial purposes in Birnin Gwari, Kachia, Kajuru, Giwa, Chikun, Igabi and Kauru LGAs, are still in force.\n\n\u201cCitizens are hereby informed that all these directives will be vigorously enforced by security agencies,\u201d Aruwan said.",

          "title": "It is God\u2019s wish I am governor today, so second term lies with him, Osun people \u2013 Adegboyega",
          "text": "Osun state Governor Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola recently featured on Rave 91.7 FM during which he spoke on the state, 30 years after creation, as well as other topical issues, including its debt profile as well as his relationship with his predecessor in office. Blueprint monitored the session and presents the excerpts.\n\nThe journey so far as Osun turned 30\n\nThank you very much. Congratulations to all of us. I must thank Almighty God for taking Osun to this level, after 30 years of its creation. I thank the founding fathers for the efforts they put into creation of the state. This 30th anniversary is worth celebrating, and we thank God for that.\n\nWell, I think the journey has been quite interesting, full of challenges though. I must thank every governor and administrator that had served this state since its creation 30 years ago. They\u2019ve all done very well. What we\u2019re doing now is to build on the existing structure that we have inherited from all of them. The journey has being quite challenging, I must say, because of the fact that as a state, we have a lot of challenges in specific areas of education, infrastructure, health, security and the economy. But I must commend all the governors that have served before me including the immediate past governor, for the efforts they put into developing the state.\n\nWithin the last almost three years of our administration, we\u2019ve actually done much to improve on what we inherited, in the areas of infrastructure, health, education, security and economy. Like I said earlier, the journey has been very challenging. But in any case, that\u2019s the essence of being in government. You face challenges and you provide solutions to whatever challenges that come your way.\n\nThe state of Osun finances appears messy. How did we get into this mess?\n\nWell, debt ordinarily is something that happens one way or the other because we don\u2019t have all the resources to do what we want to do. So, debt is actually not a curse. What is important is to ensure that whatever debt incurred is actually channelled towards capital projects that will impact positively on the people.\n\nYes, Osun had its own share of debts. I don\u2019t want to go into so much of those details. What is important is to move forward. We are coping with whatever debts that have been incurred over time, and we are ensuring that does not stop us from doing what we need to do as a government in the area of infrastructure, health, education and security. I think that\u2019s the way to talk about it, even America owes a lot of debt. They live on debt, actually. But I think we\u2019ve actually been able to manage the state\u2019s debt portfolio. We\u2019ve been paying back the inherited debt and we\u2019re still doing a lot that we need to do as a government.\n\nCan you just give us an idea of what the total debt of the state is at this moment?\n\nWell, I think it\u2019s actually in the public domain. The Debt Management Office (DMO) has actually brought up, at one time or the other, the debt profile of most of the states, including Osun. So I will reckon that it\u2019s in the region of about maybe N170 billion or so according to the last publication of the DMO, but since we\u2019ve been in government, we\u2019ve actually been able to reduce the portfolio reasonably, so it\u2019s still at the level of something that could be managed.\n\nIt\u2019s manageable?\n\nYeah!\n\nSince assuming office, have you added to the debt profile?\n\nNo. I\u2019ve not borrowed. But that\u2019s not to say that I might not borrow, given the fact that you must do some of the major projects that need time, that is, time bound, particularly given the cost of infrastructure that is going on now, you may have to really find a way of ensuring that you complete whatever you\u2019re doing. But what is important to me is the fact that even if I must borrow, I must do it in such a way that will not affect meeting my obligations to the people including payment of salaries and pension. However, as of today, 27 August, 2021, we\u2019ve not borrowed.\n\nYou\u2019ve not borrowed at all?\n\nThat\u2019s correct.\n\nAn economist once said on this programme that paying salary as and when due by your administration is a miracle. Others also say what you are doing now is a political gimmick to hoodwink the civil servants to get a second term. What\u2019s your reaction?\n\nOn the average, we\u2019re spending nothing less than N3billion every month on salaries and pensions. So, if we have even stored money somewhere by now, it would\u2019ve been exhausted. There\u2019s nothing like gimmicks. I\u2019m here to serve. So the question of gimmicks does not even come in. It\u2019s not a Greek gift, they deserve their pay. So I give priority to the payment of salaries and pension. I must look for money to pay salaries and pension, every other thing could come up but salary and pension must be paid. It\u2019s not a gimmick.\n\nI\u2019m committed to the welfare of workers. Even when I was the Chief of Staff, I was actually in charge of most of the things relating to issues of workers. I see it as an obligation that must be fulfilled. I\u2019ve heard people talk about possibility of second term, that\u2019s not the issue. The issue is that, the welfare of workers must be prioritised and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\n\nWith second term, you mean making workers\u2019 priority number one won\u2019t change?\n\nYes, absolutely, it won\u2019t change because it is not the matter of looking at it from the angle of trying to satisfy them. It is their legitimate right. Before coming into politics, I\u2019ve been a private sector person, I employed people. There was no time I did not pay my workers, so it is mandatory that you must pay your workers. It is part of what I need to do as a Chief Executive of the state, like I was a chief executive in when I was running my company. It is normal, there\u2019s nothing to it.\n\nWith the debt profile, how do you source fund for salaries and some other things?\u2026\n\n(Cuts in\u2026) Creativity is the word. You need to look at where you\u2019re and where you want to be and look at the gap and creatively plan things to take care of those gaps. I think, that\u2019s the only way one can explain what we\u2019re trying to do. For instance, if you talk of infrastructure, we don\u2019t have resources to actually do infrastructure but I can\u2019t be lamenting. When I went on \u2018Thank you\u2019 tour after our election, people were asking me to fix a lot of their roads and I can\u2019t do roads without paying salaries. You have to be creative enough to conceive the idea of alternative fund project approach which gives me leverage of having my infrastructure fixed even without my resources. People who have money, contractor who can have the means to do these things, they do it and we have understanding as to how they will be paid over time.\n\nThat\u2019s how you\u2019ve been doing infrastructure?\n\nYea! Perhaps that\u2019s the magic, alternative fund project approach. Rather than borrow, I collaborate with people that have the means, ability, funds to partner with government to fix the roads. For instance, the ongoing construction of Olaiya Flyover is being financed through this approach. But what is important is, you must display a high level of integrity, you must not renege on the basis of whatever agreement you have with these partners and so far, so good, we have been keeping to our agreements.\n\nWhy Olaiya overhead bridge? Why not a full asphalting of the Ring road, a project that your predecessor started?\n\nWith the way the city is growing, you must be proactive enough to have a foresight of making some specific arrangements to avoid congestion, to avoid accidents, particularly on that axis. If you\u2019ve ever used that road at the peak of the day, you will appreciate the need to have the flyover. There have been several accidents \u2013 I witnessed one or two myself. So, unless you have that and even thinking of a city that is growing, if we don\u2019t think of that now, there\u2019ll always be the need to have it.\n\nWhat of the abandoned road projects inherited from your predecessor?\n\nWe are still doing the ring road, we\u2019ve not abandoned it. But what I\u2019ve done differently is the fact that because I don\u2019t have money for two, three, four lanes at a time, I felt what was important for me is to complete a lane or two lanes, so that people can make use of it. If I wait until I have money to complete it the way it\u2019s been designed, it might take another four, five or seven years. So what I\u2019ve done is to ensure that one side of it is taken up to Stadium, for instance. So people are plying, they\u2019re using the road now as it is. When I have the resources, I will move to the other side, and complete the dual carriage way that it\u2019s been designed to be.\n\nWhat about the airport project?\n\nWell, the airport is desirable because of the fact that we\u2019re opening up our economy to private investment. Again, we have a lot of tourist attractions, we have tourist sites. If you don\u2019t have things like that, there will be no opportunity for people to move by road, by air, even if we have all the tourist attractions in the world, you won\u2019t be able to attract people.\n\nAgain, we are not doing the airport on our own any longer. We are partnering with federal government. They\u2019ve actually come to inspect, and I want to believe they are going to perhaps take it over in collaboration with us to complete the project.\n\nThe idea of the airport was conceived by the Oyinlola administration and it was meant to be funded jointly by the federal government and state. I think that time it was N4 billion-the federal government putting N2 billion down and the state putting N2 billion down. Unfortunately, the federal government didn\u2019t come up with their own N2 billion.\n\nI visited the minister of aviation and they\u2019ve actually assured that they will take it over and complete it. So I want to believe that given the partnership we have with the federal government, we will be able to complete the project. We\u2019re not borrowing because I know you\u2019re afraid that we might still want to borrow to complete that project.\n\nYou one said you have no issues with your predecessor-Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, But many are worried by the political wrangling. What\u2019s really the matter?\n\nWe are brothers. Well, like I said, there\u2019s no rift actually. Yeah, you can say disagreement on some areas and is not uncommon to have disagreement on certain areas, perhaps maybe policy, style and things like that. But that\u2019s not to say that we have issues at all. By and large, I have no issue with Ogbeni, he is my brother. We have come a long way we didn\u2019t meet in politics. I think the whole thing is being unduly exaggerated. I want to believe so.\n\nStill on politics, there are different groups within the party. The Osun Progressives (TOP), Ilerioluwa and there are others. The Osun Progressives seems not to be a big fan of yours. They have not been committal if they will support you for a second term in office. What issues do you have with them?\n\nI don\u2019t have issues, to be honest, I see everybody as part of the same political family. I don\u2019t believe in groups or factions, If you want to put it that way, you can have caucus, one way or the other it\u2019s natural. Even in normal club arrangement, you have people who align with one another on some things, so I don\u2019t have issues with anybody. I don\u2019t have issues with them.\n\nTalking about issue of second term, my attitude is to deliver on what I am currently doing. I don\u2019t want to be distracted. It is service to the people. If the people believe that they want me to continue, so be it. It is not a desperate situation.\n\nHowever, we have not gotten to that level (election). It is God that gives power. His appointment is not negotiable. It is God\u2019s wish that I am the Governor today. So, the issue of second term is left to God and the people of Osun to decide.\n\nWell, your excellency, you have series of endorsements of late, many groups coming out to say, we endorse you for second term. We want the governor to run for a second term. Are you sure you will have your predecessor\u2019s backing?\n\nWell, you\u2019ll need to ask him. I can\u2019t be in the position to read his mind.\n\nShouldn\u2019t it be taken for granted or matter of certainty?\n\nThat\u2019s why I am surprised you\u2019re asking.\n\nI asked this question because of what\u2019s been happening in time past \u2013 the TOP he seems to be the patron has not readily said it anywhere it will support your second term bid?\n\nWell, those people \u2014 I\u2019m not too sure that the people that have been saying that are saying his mind.

          "text": "A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman has challenged Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, to provide evidence of his claim that there is a sinister plot by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to turn Nigeria into a Fulani and Islamic caliphate.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cNarrow Politics and Questions of Democratic Development\u201d, issued Wednesday, the party chieftain also carpeted former Deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia and a retired military officer, Commodore Kunle Olawunmi for going on air on national television to allege that people in government, including a serving Governor are the sponsors of insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\nLukman stressed that such weighty allegations which is capable of creating ethnic hatreds and religious disharmony should rather be matters of judicial investigation and once proved, all identified culprits should be made to face the full wrath of the law, and not reduced to media debates, which rather highlights how low we have descended as a nation.\n\nRecall that in August 2021, there were reports of incidences of killings in Plateau State, bandit attacks on Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA), continued activities of bandits in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger States, Boko Haram \u2013 ISWAP clashes and many other criminal activities across the country which dominated national discourses.\n\nThese led to a revelation made by Commodore (Rtd) Kunle Olawunmi while granting an interview on Channels television where he alleged that government, including the presidency are the sponsors of Boko Haram and bandits.\n\nAlso in September 2020, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia similarly alleged on a live radio show that a serving Northern Governor is the sponsor of Boko Haram.\n\nLukman, who described these allegations as \u201cunsubstantiated and meaningless wild goose campaign\u201d which lack any specific proposal on how to resolve Nigeria\u2019s challenges, maintained that the claimants should have supported their claims with evidence and not just making baseless claims that are capable of setting the nation on fire.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough while making the allegations, he also claimed to have proof, after interrogation by the security, Dr. Mailafia was reported to backtracked, saying that he \u2018did not really mean to say that the government was part and parcel of the killings.\u2019 Since Commodore Olawumni has already began meeting with the security, hopefully the details of his evidence will come out.\n\n\u201cOn the part of Governor Ortom, he claimed that he has forwarded his evidence to President Buhari and security agencies in the country. But since he feels so strong as to go public with his allegation without waiting for both President Buhari and security agencies to handle the matter, he can as well make the evidence public since he has lost confidence on established processes of managing matters of national security.\u201d\n\nThe party chieftain debunked the allegations saying the only reason why such a campaign is attractive today is because President Buhari who is a Fulani man is in power.\n\n\u201cIf a primary school pupil talks like the way all the diehard opposition campaigners in the country campaigning against so-called \u2018fulanisation\u2019 and \u2018islamisation\u2019 agenda, one can excuse it because at that level of innocence, everything could appear possible. But for a public servant as highly placed as that of a Governor, retire public servant, retire security personnel, etc. it portends a big danger, which if overlooked can produce a cult mentality in the country with all the ethnic and religious hatred associated with it.\n\n\u201cBeing Governor, retired public servants, retired military personnel, with all the knowledge and experiences they have but decided to adopt the imaginary notion that a country as diverse as Nigeria can be taken over by any ethnic or religious group, is the highest manifestation of morbid symptom of attempt to block any possibility that a new society can be born out of the dying culture of corruption, greed and lawlessness, which was the hallmark of PDP\u2019s sixteen year tenure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PGF DG warned against conduct and utterances of political leaders in the country who are bent on setting the nation on fire for political gains.\n\nLukman noted that if Nigerian democracy is to develop and become the facilitator for national unity and political development in the country, there is urgent need for political parties in Nigeria to take steps to discourage ethnic and religious campaign of hatred by regulating the conduct of political leaders and elected representatives.\n\nHe added that to be able to discourage ethnic and religious campaign of hatred in the country, it would require that parties put in place internal code of conducts \u2013 byelaws, beyond what is provided in their constitution as parties, as they are today, are weak in regulating the conducts of political leaders and elected representatives.",

          "text": "Kebbi State Governor Atiku Bagudu on Thursday argued that mapping out grazing routes will help to identify the scale of the herder-farmer crisis.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently ordered a committee to review 368 grazing sites across 25 states in the country to determine the levels of encroachment.\n\nCritics have faulted the President\u2019s directive, noting that ranching is a more viable alternative to open grazing.\n\nREAD ALSO: Kaduna Govt Bans Transportation Of Livestock\n\nBut, speaking on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, Mr Bagudu said the President\u2019s directive does not preclude the idea of ranching.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to identify grazing routes and work with states and map them. It is not to recover grazing routes, it is to identify the scale of the problem,\u201d Mr Bagudu said.\n\n\u201cMr President is interested in an audit of grazing reserves. It is a voluntary and collaborative thing with the states.\n\n\u201cPeople say we have spoken about ranching. Yes, but what is a ranch? Ranching does not take place in the air, it takes place on a piece of land.\n\n\u201cRanches are as big as grazing reserves. In some countries like Australia, some ranches are bigger than some Nigerian states.\n\n\u201cSo how do you know what\u2019s available, what can be supported to host those roving, herding communities who need help to modernise?\u201d\n\nShared public interest\n\nWhen asked why the President appeared to have taken a special interest in helping herders modernise since it is a private business, Mr Bagudu said the issue is a \u201cshared public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have interest historically to make our farmers do better,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have all kinds of programs and extension services, so our farmers can do better. And it is a desirable public goal.\n\n\u201cSo, historically, we have invested more in the farming sector, to the disadvantage of both fishing and animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cWe want to help them (herders) modernise so Nigeria can benefit and generate more value from this important sector.\n\n\u201cIf we can support those in the banking sector with five trillion to save the banks from collapsing, I don\u2019t think we are doing any disservice to support our farmers, support millions in the animal husbandry sector and support our fishing communities as well.\u201d",

          "text": "In a satellite town of Senegal\u2019s capital Dakar, 25-kilo sacks of onions are piled up on pavements, ignored by passers-by.\n\nThe West African country is in the middle of a supply glut, with prices plummeting and heaps of the pungent vegetables left to rot by the roadside. Farmers are in despair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give some to the local women,\u201d says farmer Diongue Masseye, 71, gazing despondently at his onions.\n\nHe is standing inside a 450 square metre (5,000 square foot) warehouse in Bambilor, an onion-producing town about 30 kilometres (20 miles) northeast of the capital Dakar, where his unsold produce has started to sprout.\n\nGloomy farmers \u2014 who produce about 450,000 tonnes of onions a year \u2014 blame the problem on increased foreign competition and a lack of storage capacity.\n\nBut the government also argues that farmers have overproduced this year, flooding the market with onions and depressing prices.\n\nMasseye said prices had nearly halved. A 25-kilo sack of onions fetched the equivalent of about 13 euros ($15) a few months ago, he said, but are now worth about seven euros ($8).\n\nThe bulbous vegetable is a lifeline to many in the nation of 16 million people, where it is a key ingredient in the national fish-and-rice dish, Thieboudienne, as well as Yassa chicken.\n\nAmadou Abdoul Sy, the director of Senegal\u2019s market regulation agency, said some 200,000 farmers are employed in the onion sector.\n\n\u201cEveryone is producing at the same time,\u201d he told AFP, explaining the glut.\n\nREAD ALSO: South Africa Declines Request To Take In Afghan Refugees\n\nBad onions\n\nSenegal\u2019s onion sector has long been plagued by problems. Almost a third of the crop is lost every year, Sy said.\n\nThe UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation noted in a 2018 report that the use of low-quality seeds by Senegalese farmers contributes to the problem.\n\nOften, producers also harvest their onions too early to try to get ahead of the competition, leaving the vegetables wet. This leads to significant losses and makes onions difficult to store, the FAO said.\n\nConsumers are shying away from the damaged goods.\n\nTrader Daouda Mbaye, in a market in a village in western Senegal, demonstrated sacks of poor-quality onions and said buyers were more interested in other vegetables.\n\nBut to the dismay of local farmers, many people will buy imported onions.\n\nThe president of Senegal\u2019s onion producers association, Boubacar Sall, said the government suspended onion imports in January in a bid to help struggling locals.\n\nBut foreign-owned farms in Senegal are still producing onions, he explained. They are often larger than Senegalese farms and have better storage facilities.\n\nThe onion farmer is calling for legislation that will protect small producers who fall \u201cprey to unfair competition\u201d from larger ones.\n\nLack of storage facilities are a chronic problem in Senegal, according to farmers, where a warm climate means vegetables quickly go bad.\n\nFor Masseye, the 71-year-old farmer, the government should have provided refrigerated storerooms to ease pressure on producers.\n\nBut Amadou Abdoul Sy, the director of the market regulation agency, said that producers themselves are partly to blame.\n\nHe said government authorities had asked farmers to sell their goods at different times in order to stop a supply glut.\n\n\u201cThey were not listened to,\u201d Sy said.\n\nWhile farmers are unhappy, some consumers are pleased.\n\nAstou Ndiagne, a housewife in Bambilor, flashed a mischievous smile when asked about the lower prices. \u201cThis is allowing us to save money,\u201d she said.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "New Zealand authorities said Friday they shot and killed a violent extremist after he entered a supermarket and stabbed and injured six shoppers.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the incident as a terror attack. She said the man was a Sri Lankan national who was inspired by the Islamic State group. She said he was well known to the nation\u2019s security agencies and was being monitored around the clock.\n\nShe said that by law, the man was not allowed to be kept in prison.\n\nArdern said that three of those who had been stabbed were seriously injured.\n\n\u201cThis was a violent attack. It was senseless,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cAnd I am so sorry that it happened.\u201d\n\nThe attack unfolded at about 2:40 p.m. at a Countdown supermarket in New Zealand\u2019s largest city, Auckland.\n\nArdern said that because the man was under constant monitoring, a police surveillance team and a special tactics group were able to shoot and kill him within 60 seconds of the attack starting.\n\nPolice Commissioner Andrew Coster said they had concerns about the man\u2019s ideology and kept very close tabs on him. Coster said they followed him from his home to the supermarket on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe entered the store, as he had done before. He obtained a knife from within the store,\u201d Coster said. \u201cSurveillance teams were as close as they possibly could be to monitor his activity.\u201d\n\nCoster said that when the commotion started, two police from the special tactics group rushed over. He said the man approached police with the knife and so they shot and killed him.\n\nOne bystander video taken from inside the supermarket records the sound of 10 shots being fired in rapid succession.\n\nArdern said legal constraints prevented her from discussing everything that she wanted to about the case, but she was hoping to have those constraints lifted soon.\n\nSome shoppers in the supermarket reportedly tried to help those who had been wounded with towels and diapers.\n\n\u201cTo everyone who was there and who witnessed such a horrific event, I can\u2019t imagine how they will be feeling in the aftermath,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cBut thank you for coming to the aid of those who needed you when they needed you.\u201d\n\nAuckland is currently in a strict lockdown as it battles an outbreak of the coronavirus. Most businesses are shut and people are generally allowed to leave their homes only to buy groceries, for medical needs or to exercise.",

          "text": "Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Friday he would step down, setting the stage for a new premier after a one-year tenure here marred by an unpopular COVID-19 response and rapidly dwindling public support.\n\nSuga, who took over after Shinzo Abe resigned here last September citing ill health, has seen his support ratings sink to below 30% as the nation struggles with its worst wave of COVID-19 infections ahead of a general election this year.\n\nSuga did not capitalise on his last major achievement \u2013 hosting the Olympics, which were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic months before Suga took office as coronavirus cases surged.\n\nSuga\u2019s decision to not run in a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) election in September means the party will choose a new leader, who will become prime minister.\n\nBefore Abe \u2013 Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, with an eight-year tenure \u2013 the country had gone through six prime ministers in as many years, including Abe\u2019s own troubled first one-year tenure.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei average futures here jumped 2% immediately after media reports that Suga would not run, while the broader Topix Index extended its gains and hit its highest levels since 1991 following the news.\n\n\u201cI want to focus on coronavirus response, so I told the LDP executive meeting that I\u2019ve decided not to run in the party leadership race,\u201d Suga told reporters.\n\n\u201cI judged that I cannot juggle both and I should concentrate on either of them,\u201d Suga said. He added that he would hold a news conference as early as next week.\n\nThe address ended a rollercoaster week here in which Suga pulled out all the stops to save his job, including suggestions he would sack his long-term party ally, as well as plans to dissolve parliament here and reshuffle party executive and his cabinet.\n\nRuling LDP officials said Suga would stay on until his successor is chosen in party-wide election slated for Sept. 29.\n\nThe winner of the contest is all but assured of being premier because of the LDP\u2019s majority in the lower house. The government has been considering holding the general election on Oct. 17.\n\nRACE FOR LEADER\n\nSuga\u2019s decision opens up the party chief race here, as there is no clear favourite to replace the outgoing leader.\n\nFumio Kishida, a soft-spoken former foreign minister, is one of the only two lawmakers who have so far declared their candidacy. On Thursday, he criticised here Suga\u2019s coronavirus response and urged a stimulus package to combat the pandemic.\n\n\u201cKishida is the top runner for the time being but that doesn\u2019t mean his victory is assured,\u201d said Koichi Nakano, political science professor at Sophia University.\n\nNakano said popular Administrative Reform Minister Taro Kono could run if he gets backing of his faction leader, Finance Minister Taro Aso, while former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba could also run but looks at a disadvantage.\n\nKono has led Japan\u2019s rocky vaccination rollout but remains high on the list of lawmakers voters want to see succeed Suga.\n\nThe former foreign and defence minister, Kono is popular with younger voters after building support through Twitter, where he has 2.3 million followers \u2013 a rarity in Japanese politics dominated by men in their 60s or older.\n\nIshiba is a soft-spoken former defence minister and rare LDP critic of Abe when the latter was in office.\n\nAbe\u2019s stance will be closely watched given his influence inside two largest factions of the LDP \u2013 his own Hosoda group and the second-largest faction led by Finance Minister Taro Aso \u2013 as well as among the conservative MPs, experts say.\n\nUnlike last year, grassroots LDP members will vote along with the party\u2019s members of parliament, which makes the outcome of the party leader race harder to predict.\n\nThe LDP-led coalition is not expected to lose its majority in the powerful lower house, but forecasts suggest that the LDP could lose the majority that it holds on its own, an outcome that would weaken whoever is leading the party next.\n\n\u201cStock prices are rising based on a view that the chance of LDP\u2019s defeat in the general election has diminished because anyone other than Suga will be able to regain popularity,\u201d said senior economist at Daiwa Securities Toru Suehiro.\n\nSuga\u2019s image as a savvy political operator capable of pushing through reforms and taking on the stodgy bureaucracy propelled his support to 74 percent when he took office.\n\nInitially, populist promises such as lower mobile phone rates and insurance for fertility treatments were applauded.\n\nBut removing scholars critical of the government from an advisory panel and compromising with a junior coalition partner on policy for healthcare costs for the elderly drew criticism.\n\nHis delay in halting the \u201cGo To\u201d domestic travel programme \u2013 which experts say may have helped spread coronavirus around Japan \u2013 hit hard, while the public grew weary of states of emergency that hurt businesses.\n\nReuters",

But, with Kabul airport still closed, many were seeking to flee here over land.\n\nThousands of Afghans here, some without documents, others with pending U.S. visa applications or whose families have mixed immigration status, also wait in \u201ctransit hubs\u201d in third countries.\n\nReuters",
