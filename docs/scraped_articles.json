I didn\u2019t know how to accept it. I didn\u2019t know how to not blame myself or think it was my fault. It changed who I was completely. It changed my body, it changed thoughts.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn January 2020, she also recounted how she developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of being raped and also not able to processes that trauma.\n\nBut in the latest docuseries, Gaga revealed that she was sexually assaulted by a music producer who threatened to burn her music if she didn\u2019t take off her clothes at the time.\n\n\u201cI was 19 years old, and I was working in the business, and a producer said to me, \u2018Take your clothes off,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I said no. And I left, and they told me they were going to burn all of my music. And they didn\u2019t stop.

          "title": "Miyetti Allah leader to Fulani herders: Don\u2019t obey open grazing ban",
          "text": "National President of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Abdullahi Bello Bodejo has dismissed the ban on open grazing declared recently by the Southern Governors Forum. He has also instructed Fulani herdsmen not to obey the directive but to keep grazing their cattle wherever they find themselves in all the states of the country.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the leader of the Fulani socio-cultural organisation stressed that the governors were jokers, accusing them of plotting to take over the cattle business in Nigeria.\n\nHow will Fulani herdsmen cope with the ban on open grazing declared by the Southern governors?\n\nWe are going to follow the law and see how to approach some good leaders in the South-East, South-West and the South-South. We will also approach the Inspector General of Police and other security agencies to protect our people.\n\nIt is not about grazing; it is a plan against Fulani people. Some people want to hijack the cattle business from us. Anywhere you go now, you see Fulani grazing cows and you will think they belong to them. No! The cows belong some people in that area or community. If you go to Benue, the state that first promulgated the anti open grazing law, you can see cows grazing; their owners are Tiv people. Even the governor, Samuel Ortom, has so many cows. They want to chase us away and continue with our business.\n\nWhat these Southern governors are trying to do, some other African countries tried it, but it didn\u2019t work. So, this one will not be an exception. You can\u2019t just wake up without plan B, and say you have banned open grazing. This business has history; we didn\u2019t just wake up and start cow rearing. It is a blessing from God; it is God that blesses us with this business, it is not like farming or palm wine tapping business. This is from the beginning; the only thing is how to transform the business. These governors are confused; they are trying to deny Fulani their rights and means of livelihood. Nigeria has only one constitution, which the governors are breaching. We may approach the court to stop them from carrying out their plans. The process by which they arrived at their decision was wrong. They were supposed to have invited us because we are part of their various states. If you are a governor, you are a governor for everybody living in that state. Since we live in all the states doing our business, it behooved them to have invited us to the meeting. I don\u2019t know who is giving them this evil idea. No state can progress without Fulani being in that state; any state without Fulani is backward and poor. Fulani attract blessing. They don\u2019t have problem, but unfortunately, people attribute kidnapping, robbery and banditry to them. It is not fair. They have not seen their people killing police and other security personnel. How many police stations have Fulani burnt? How many policemen have Fulani killed? But they want to tamper with the business God has blessed us with. The governors are very wrong.\n\nYou said other African countries tried to ban open grazing and it didn\u2019t work, but these governors seem determined to execute it.\n\nI say it categorically that this ban on open grazing by the Southern governors will never work. The only thing that can stop us from grazing in any area is if there are no grasses and water in such place. Fulani don\u2019t have borders or boundaries; they don\u2019t need permission to graze their cows from one area to another area.\n\nThere is no law, no constitution prohibiting them from doing so. Fulani are educated and they believe in leadership. They follow the constitution, which permits them internationally to graze anywhere. ECOWAS permits us to graze anywhere, but any person that commits a crime, let the law of the land be visited upon such a person.\n\nDo these governors want to tell me that in their states, only Fulani herdsmen are their problems? Let them know that what they are doing is against the law. They are confused and they don\u2019t know what they are doing in their respective states. They are confused and also jokers. That law cannot be obeyed. You can\u2019t wake up and ban somebody from doing his legitimate business without providing a Plan B for him. Are they not in Nigeria? If they have a hidden agenda, they should make it open for everybody to see. They don\u2019t have a reason for what they want to do. Governors have powers and if they wake up and decide to do whatever they like with the Fulani, then we shall see. They should remember that before them were some leaders in this country and if all these leaders, Zik, Awo, Ahmadu Bello, etc had toed their line; this country would not have been here for them to be governors. God has blessed some parts of this country with oil, some parts with agriculture and others with cattle rearing. However, we don\u2019t want anybody to tamper with what God has blessed us with.\n\nYou said you are going to petition the IGP. Why?\n\nWe are going to write to the Inspector General of Police to provide enough security to our people wherever they may be in the South because they are under threat. This morning I have received 46 calls from our people there who want to leave, but they are scared of what may happen to them on the way. Since the governors are the chief security officers of their states, they should provide security for them to leave their states. Grazing or no grazing, the Fulani will survive. A Fulani man can trek from Abuja to Cameroun, from Abuja to Somali, Abuja to Central Africa. It is only Fulani that can do that. You can\u2019t dictate to them how to run their business or their lives. You didn\u2019t provide electricity, water, school, hospital to them. Now, people are taking vaccine for COVID-19, you don\u2019t remember them. They are doing their businesses inside the bush and you still want to stop them, and yet they are feeding you with the meat! If we order our people to leave the South, may be the governors will be eating dog meat. I don\u2019t know what they will be eating if we stop our people from going there.\n\nIf you were a farmer, you took a bank facility to plant maize, millet, cassava, and then cows descend on the farm and eat up the crops, what would you do?\n\nIs there any nearby police station in that area? Is there any court in that area? Such a wicked person is supposed to be arrested, prosecuted and jailed. Such person is not a good rearer. In Nasarawa, Plateau states, for example, we have a vigilante that joined hands with the communities. We will send our vigilante to arrest any person who commits this kind of atrocity. If he is a small boy, they will arrest his father and everybody in the house and take them to the police station and force them to pay for the damage done to the farmer. We are good leaders, we can\u2019t support anybody who will go and destroy somebody\u2019s farm. That is what the governors should do. They are supposed to join hand with the good Fulani to deal with those who are spoiling our names, which is better than waking up to ask our people to leave their area.\n\nWill you invite Buhari to mediate over this matter?\n\nWe will like the Federal Government to intervene between Fulani and these governors who don\u2019t like them. They should be made to know that this country is one and forget about those their boys \u2013 IPOB and Oduduwa boys. These boys are joking and we are not part of their joke. We don\u2019t have time for that. They killed Fulani fathers and children. I urge the security agencies to go after these killers.\n\nTalking about killings, last month, some people alleged to be herdsmen killed about 25 people in Ebonyi State. What do you say to that?\n\nIf other people kill some people, they pin it to herdsmen. How many herdsmen have the police in that area arrested? How many herdsmen are in police custody? Herdsmen were not responsible for the killings. They can say Fulani were the ones involved, but how many of them were arrested? I can only believe it if the Commissioner of Police says that they arrested a Fulani or some of them who did the killing. The propaganda is too much. Like a big lie that Ortom told. He said Fulani attacked him and he ran away. How did he recognise a person who wanted to kill him while he was running? Did he have any video to prove they were Fulani? Some people are now learning Fulani language. Like in a video, one boy alleged to be a Biafra person was speaking pure Fulani language and people will take him for a Fulani. If such a person goes to kill, and he speaks Fulani, people will say the killer was a Fulani man. Let the police do their investigation, and thereafter people can draw conclusions. Many people are trying to cause trouble because Buhari is a Fulani man. Everybody is angry with the Fulani.\n\nHow do you mean? The late President Yar\u2019Adua was also Fulani, and there were no such issues\u2026\n\nYes, Yar\u2019Adua was Fulani. He tried to unite the country. He gave the Niger Delta militants amnesty. Buhari is also in the process of uniting the country. Till now, the Federal Government has not looked into our problem. I get very much annoyed and curse such people who say Buhari is backing the Fulani. He has not done anything for us. We are the first people he is supposed to do something for, but he hasn\u2019t done anything for us. See how they are funding rice farmers. See what work he is doing in the South. We are calling on him to wake up and give us our grazing areas. We may consider paying a courtesy visit to Southern governors on this issue and make them see reason to reverse their position. If they can\u2019t invite the Fulani associations, they are supposed to invite the Sultan of Sokoto and other emirs, who are also Fulani for that policy. Some people were educated and went to school through the Fulani, so they are not supposed to treat us in this way. Thank God that the Nigeria\u2019s constitution gives the governors only four years and the highest is eight years. These governors who came up with this evil law, some of them in the next two years will become former governors. We also believe that those who will replace them will change the narrative. We believe in one Nigeria and we want everyone to be one. I\u2019m about going to marry an Igbo girl from Enugu. Then these people shouting Biafra will see that the leader of Miyetti Allah has become their in-law. A Rivers State man is married to my aunt and they have ten children \u2013 some of their names are Kate, Ndidi, Kingsley, etc. If I go to Rivers State, nobody can chase me out because I have cousins there. But it should be pointed out that Igbo and Yoruba cannot stop Fulani from grazing their cattle in their areas.\n\nWe have separatist agitators who want to leave Nigeria. What is your view?\n\nIf the country breaks up, we don\u2019t have any problem. Even if they break it into 32 parts, it is not a problem to us. But let them not forget that the Fulani are cooking their food under the trees in the bush. If you are looking for Fulani trouble, be ready to leave the city and join him to cook your food under the tree. Or else, allow him to be. Don\u2019t touch them. If you chase the Fulani away, you kill their mother, father, and others, do you think you will sleep with both eyes closed? They don\u2019t look for trouble, but don\u2019t look for their trouble.\n\nYou said if Nigeria splits, it doesn\u2019t concern the Fulani. How do you mean?\n\nThe Fulani don\u2019t have borders. If I want to migrate to Ghana now, nobody can stop me. If a Fulani man wants to relocate to Sudan, can you stop him? So, we don\u2019t have a problem if they tear Nigeria apart. But the only thing is that our forefathers suffered to build Nigeria and they treated everybody, Igbo, Yoruba and others equally, and that is why we are saying let Nigeria be one united country. But we are not scared of anything. For Yoruba, if you leave Ogun and Lagos, you cannot see any other Yoruba country again. It is the same thing with the Igbo. Go anywhere, you can see Fulani, even in the 36 states. The only thing is that you can\u2019t appreciate their population because they are inside the bush and don\u2019t care what is going on in the city. How then do you want to chase them out? I\u2019m directing all the herdsmen in the South not to leave or go anywhere and they should continue to graze their cattle in that region because it is Nigeria. They should not mind the governors who have violated the constitution that guarantees everybody freedom to live and do legitimate business in any part of the country. They can\u2019t expect the Fulani to respect their law, which is inferior to Nigeria\u2019s constitution. Let them think on how to provide basic amenities to their people instead of fighting the herdsmen. Fulani are not problem in this country, but some desperate politicians are trying to give them a bad name. Some of these Southern governors have seen that their tenure is ending in two years time and they are not popular among their people to the extent that any candidate they sponsor for election, even for councillorship in 2023 will fail and that may be the reason for the meeting, to cause confusion in the country.\n\nI want to tell these governors, even in their dreams, none of them will be president or vice president in this country. If they have a hidden agenda, let them make it open so that Nigerians will advise them. I don\u2019t know what they are looking for.",

          "title": "Agitators for Biafra, Yoruba Nation are illiterates -Ex Presidential Aspirant, Olawepo-Hashim",
          "text": "Oil mogul and former presidential candidate in 2019, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has dismissed those agitating for secession in the country. In an interview with ADETUTU FOLASADE-KOYI, he also speaks on how to resolve the country\u2019s political imbalance and why a referendum, ahead of the 2023 general election is unnecessary.\n\nThere are calls for secession in two regions of the country now. Is that not worrisome?\n\nThis is just nonsense, to be honest with you. It is pure nonsense. Nigeria, in the Independence Constitution that we had, there were democratically-elected leaders. They were not handpicked and they went to the Lancaster conference in 1957 and 1958.\n\nThe Eastern delegates were led by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Western delegates were led by Chief Obafemi Awolowo and the northern delegates were led by Sir Ahmadu Bello. And an Independence Constitution was negotiated. One of the critical elements of the Independence Constitution, which remains with all the constitutions that we have had, whether midwifed by the military or whatever, is the principle of indivisibility and indissolubility of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; this was agreed by all the regions.\n\nSo, this theory by some illiterates \u2013 and some of them may be professors \u2013 and they go about talking nonsense as if that is the truth. This theory that Nigeria was put together forcefully by the British is false because the people of Nigeria did negotiate the constitution, led by democratically elected leaders. And, the principle of indissolubility and indivisibility of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was agreed. In fact, it was thoroughly debated at the Lancaster Conference in London, where component regions should have the right to secede or not.\n\nThe South West wanted it, the Northern Region also did not mind it. In fact, the most compelling argument for national unity came from Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe who said that we should have a model constitution like the constitution of the United States of America where secession is an act of treason and that Nigeria should exist in unity in perpetuity!\n\nBut with the present realities, are you telling me Nigerians cannot renegotiate our unity?\n\nI am not convinced that the unity of Nigeria is the problem. What I think is the problem is the mismanagement of our diversity. That is the issue.\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nWell, in the sense that we have not allowed the elements that can guarantee efficient management of state power to operate. We had a coup in 1966 that took powers from the sub-national authorities that would have efficiently managed the situation like security you are talking about. If anything happens in a local government, the people who live in that community will know who the criminals are.\n\nIt is easier when security is managed at that level than when it is managed from the central government. There is always a problem with even trust. People will not volunteer information easily. So, some of the security problems we are having is traceable to the fact that powers that were residing at the local level have been taken away and dumped at the federal level. And, you know, interestingly, a lot of people like to blame the Fulani but, the people who carried out the 1966 coup were not Fulani.\n\nSo it is not about Hausa or Igbo or Yoruba, it is about the fact that we have distorted the most essential element of managing diversity; which is to have a level of control mobilisation and development and two key elements, security and the economy are the most important elements of activities in a society.\n\nAnd when you have taken those powers and dumped them at the centre, then you snuff out creativity and efficiency and the state can no longer function at its optimum. When we decentralise, we will regain our balance and I do not think that the issue is our unity. The issue is that we distorted the essential principles of managing that diversity and now we must restore it. That is the solution, not secession and I have not seen an African country that achieved secession that has been better off. Eritrea is not better off than they were. They fought for almost 30 years to leave Ethiopia; what have they achieved after they left? Look at South Sudan; they are now even fighting and all that.\n\nAnd, let me tell you, Nigeria is more of a blessing than a curse. When people are talking: \u2018let us secede.\u2019 Secede to where?\n\nBefore Nigeria was amalgamated, there was nothing called a Yoruba nation. What you had was Oyo Empire and the various sub-nationalities in the present South West were in 200 years war against Oyo, the Ekiti and all that. They were all fighting Oyo; to be independent of Oyo. There was so much insecurity. This was a war that was fought) for 200 years. So what do they mean by a Yoruba nation? There was no Yoruba nation before the British amalgamated Nigeria. There was Oyo Empire under Alafin and the Egbas had their own flag and they had their own generals fighting Oyo, fighting Ibadan. Ibadan was the city state that was aligned to Oyo. Even the lower flank to the North, Ilorin, that one had broken up from Oyo. It wanted its own independence. Everybody wanted independence from Oyo Empire. So what is the Yoruba nation that they are talking about?\n\nAnd the ones in the East that are talking about Biafra, they didn\u2019t even have a kingdom. They didn\u2019t have any empire. What do you mean by Biafra? Everybody was at the clan level when the British came to that place. The only thing in the South-East and South-South that was a big kingdom was Benin and everybody was either a vassal to Benin directly or indirectly in those areas. Secession is pure nonsense. Secession to where?\n\nSome agitators point at the current imbalance, saying one tribe was favoured over others in appointments. Yet you say our Constitution maintains our indivisibility and indissolubility?\n\nWell, that is the problem with the character of a government; it is not a problem with the character of the country. Yar\u2019Adua was president of Nigeria; were all his appointments from Katsina? So, must you break Nigeria because now you are having issues with appointments? If you are having issues with appointments, there are constitutional remedies to correct that. We have the Federal Character Commission; there is no state in this country that is not represented in the Federal Character Commission. Where is their report? Where are the voices of their state representatives? They all keep quiet; they don\u2019t say anything! Then, apart from the institution such as the Federal Character Commission, where is the party? We have governed this country before, in 1999, and 60 per cent of all federal boards were appointed by the committee set up by the National Regulatory Committee. We zoned every big board appointment!\n\nIn our time, if the chairman of the Nigeria Ports Authority is zoned to the South-South, that of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation cannot be retained in the South-South; it goes to another region. That was how we did it and, at the end of the day, even if (former) President (Olusegun) Obasanjo wanted to do otherwise, it was impossible for him to do. So, one of the problems that you have is not just with the government, virtually all the institutions have collapsed and they have to do with the character of the occupants of those institutions not because those institutions cannot work. Even if you go your way, it is not the guarantee that there will be development in those places. Some people will still be oppressive if you don\u2019t have good leaders. If you don\u2019t have people who are ready to speak up and take up responsibilities that they have signed for, those countries, if they become independent, will not do well.\n\nIn the Second Republic, whenever the party spoke, the state actors toe that line. After 2003, progressively, it is a different ball game for our political parties. Can we go back to that era?\n\nYes we must. Even in countries of Africa that were one party states, the party was strong. All the noise against (late President Robert) Mugagbe, he did not leave until the ZANU PF took a decision and said \u2018okay!\u2019 Mugabe knew it was all over at that point, even as the country was a one-party state. The ANC (in South Africa), when they turned against (former President) Jacob Zuma, that was the end of him. So, you need a strong party.\n\nBut political parties are not as independent as before. How do we go back to that era because moneybags, governors and political state actors have hijacked the parties?\n\nSome of the people who are shouting today, they were the ones who killed the political parties. I was expelled from the PDP in 2000 because we were insisting on the doctrine of party supremacy. Some people in government humiliated those of us who formed the PDP because they wanted unlimited control over government. Myself, (late) Harry Marshal, some of the founding fathers of PDP then, we were all expelled in one day, in a well programmed attack against the national executive committee of the party, by some people who were shouting that they want to be president today, by some people who are crying that democracy is suffering, they were the ones who killed democracy!\n\nThey did not want the party founders; who are great men. I was one of the youngest of the Group of 34 that started PDP and these were great men, those were people who had been in government and they have never stolen money. (Late) Chief Solomon Lar never had a piece of land in Abuja here. (Late) Alhaji Adamu Ciroma never had a house in Abuja here yet, he had been governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He had been Minister of Finance. He had seen money more than anybody else had seen. We were inspired by leaders who wanted the best for this country and we respected them, not because they were moneybags. We followed them. We spent our money behind them because we believed in them.\n\nThen, some miscreants came into government and they didn\u2019t want this structure that brought them into government to have any influence on their policies and we were always fighting, it was war from 1999 between the party and some people. Do you know how many times the PDP secretariat was surrounded by armoured tanks? The party itself! They brought armoured tanks to the party secretariat because they wanted to get some people out of the party forcefully. The fight that happened in PDP, between 1999 and 2001 has not happened since then and this was why we lost it. Now, regrettably, the same people who caused the problem are busy jumping about pontificating! One of the problems of Nigeria is that most Nigerians don\u2019t have a sense of history. There is a sense of collective amnesia in this country and people pretend not to even remember things that happened six months ago. So there is no way you can make progress as a country if you don\u2019t have a sense of history.\n\nSo, back to the issue, it is not just about (President Muhammadu) Buhari. It is not about secession, it is not about any Fulani, you need strong institutions to have a functioning democracy. Some of the people that are saying they want to secede, how are their governors managing their states? Some of them don\u2019t have five kilometres of functional local roads. Even with the money that is available right now. Is it Buhari that is doing that one?\n\nSo, we have a lot of issues but where we are is very simple. Let\u2019s first of all deal with issues that we can agree on and then move forward gradually from there and the rest questions will be resolved politically, democratically on the field of the election if we allow programmes to govern our choices.\n\nOnce it is election time now, nobody is focused on the candidates, where is he coming from, who is he, what is his pedigree? You, the media, also have to help to moderate the debate about choices and what issues should govern the political contest. So, we all have our various roles to play in this issue.\n\nIs a referendum necessary now before we go into 2023 elections?\n\nThat will be a distraction. Referendum for what?\n\nWell, referendum to address how to move Nigeria forward\n\nDo we need to complicate issues? Look, Boko Haram and the bandits are in Shiroro (Niger State) and few kilometres from Abuja. There are some bandits in the forest of Kaduna. Is it a referendum that you need now or you need to get those guys out of that place and move them back as much as possible? What we need now is to secure, at least, let us secure the North Central states that are around Abuja and that is what my six-point agenda is all about. We need to immediately guaranty security in the various states and local governments.\n\nAnd we can write our lawmakers now, to amend the sub-sections of the constitution and get concurrence from the states. We can actually do this within the next 60 days. In fact, we can get this done, if there is the will, within the next 30 days. We can actually do it so that the states and the local governments can legitimately raise their local police instead of this vigilante stuff. We need proper police not vigilantes. The vigilantes themselves will become terrors. There must be standard operating procedure that is modern, that even civilised people who want to provide assistance can relate to. A modern structure. I mean, what assistant and support can you get when their insignia is like 15th Century village hunters?",

          "text": "Conversations were still milling around the death of Abubakar Shekau, the dreaded Boko Haram leader who was reportedly killed on Wednesday by ISWAP, when suddenly Nigerians were hit by the news of a plane crash that claimed the life of Ibrahim Attahiru, a three-star general and the commander of the largest component of the armed forces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanding tall and always appearing combat ready, Attahiru, in the past five years had been active in the fight against Boko Haram, a group that has terrorised the north-east for more than a decade. Upon his appointment as army chief in January, he continued to visit troops at the frontline every month before his death.\n\nAttahiru was flying alongside 10 officers from Abuja to Kaduna on Friday evening when the aircraft, belonging to the Nigerian Air Force crashed near Kaduna International Airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the accident investigation board (AIB) has been asked to investigate the cause, military authorities believe the incident was caused by \u201cinclement weather\u201d.\n\nWeeks into his appointment, the general immediately stood out from other service chiefs as he appeared determined in his efforts to secure the territorial integrity of Nigeria. He was clear about his plans and was already putting things in place to ensure results.\n\nTOOK OVER THE ARMY AT A CRITICAL PERIOD\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to his appointment, many officers and soldiers seemed to be losing interest in the war against Boko Haram under Tukur Buratai, his predecessor who had spent more time in office than statutorily required. Attahiru, upon resumption of office, quickly effected a change in formations and began winning the interest of his officers and soldiers.\n\nWhile some of his men did not agree with his plans, some others believe they were good plans which will put the army on the right path.\n\n\u201cEvery chief comes with its own goals and plans, but beyond putting it on paper, Attahiru had started making the moves,\u201d said a senior officer in the army headquarters.\n\nFor years, a larger part of the army\u2019s resources had been deployed in fighting Boko Haram, but Attahiru now had to also deal with bandits in the north-west, parts of the north-central, and kidnappers across the south.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI and my colleagues took over command of our respective services at a very critical period due to daunting security challenges,\u201d he had said in March.\n\n\u201cIn line with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directives and my intent to rebuild the Nigerian army into a formidable force, I conceived the vision of having \u2018A Nigerian army that is repositioned to professionally defeat all adversaries in a joint environment.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo breathe life into this vision, he released his command philosophy which has readiness, capacity, continuous leadership development and duty to control as cardinal pillars.\n\nHe had promised to build on the dependability of the Nigerian Army to accomplish any mission in line with the norms enshrined in army\u2019s values and ethics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder his watch, he had said, the army would remain resolute in decisively dealing with threats against Nigeria.\n\n\u201dAs I speak, we will soon be receiving combat enablers that would enhance and boost our operations. Concerted effort is also being made to eliminate the threat of improvised explosives devices which has been a major impediment to troops and operations in operation Lafiya Dole,\u201d he said.\n\nOwing to the unending complaints of lack of equipement from troops at the frontline, the new army chief immediately approved the purchase of spare parts and directed all damaged and serviceable equipment in the theatre to be back-loaded for immediate repairs.\n\nHe assured his men of his determination \u201cto rebuild the fighting skills, capacity, confidence and morale of the troops\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n48 HOURS ULTIMATUM TO RECAPTURE AREAS HELD BY BOKO HARAM\n\nAs if there was a plot by Boko Haram to check the strength of the new army chief, there was a series of attacks on some communities in the north-east by the insurgents, coming barely a month after Attahiru had settled into office.\n\nBut while on an operational visit to Dikwa, Borno state in February, Attahiru charged the troops to go after the insurgents and recapture areas held by them.\n\nGiving a 48-hour ultimatum, the army chief also assured the troops of improved equipment in getting the task done.\n\n\u201cIt is now high time we get back and fight through and support our forces ahead of you,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cAreas around Marte, Chikingudo, Kirenowa, up to Kirta, Wulgo must be cleared in the next 48 hours. Be rest assured of all the support required in this very onerous task.\n\n\u201cI have just spoken to the theatre commander, and the general officer commanding 7 division, you must not let this nation down. Go back and do the needful and I will be right behind you.\n\n\u201cYou are aware of the recent attack on Dikwa and Marte, you should not allow this to happen again, go after them and clear these bastards.\u201d\n\nIndeed, after the ultimatum, the listed communities were recaptured by the army.\n\nKILLED FIVE BOKO HARAM COMMANDERS\n\nAlthough the task for Attahiru In 2017, when he was theatre commander of Operation Lafiya Dole was to capture Shekau, he was only able to kill five other commanders of the sect before his redeployment.\n\nBuratai, the immediate past army chief, had given Attahiru a 40-day ultimatum to capture Shekau.\n\nIn his valedictory speech at the operation, Attahiru, however, said his team killed five Boko Haram commanders and neutralised 70 terrorists while he was at the helm.\n\n\u201cSuffice to note that during the operations, 5 high profile BHT commanders and many foot soldiers were killed, while many other members of the group surrendered owing to the effectiveness of the operations,\u201d he had said in December 2017.\n\n\u201cNone kinetic operations were also conducted through coordinated media and information operations that led to the surrender of 72 BHT, who were immediately inducted into Operation SAFE CORRIDOR.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, operational support was also provided to troops of Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) during Operation RAWAN KADA in June 2017, which led to the killing of over 70 BHT and the capture of assorted automatic weapons.\u201d\n\nASKED FOR A PROBE OF ARMS PURCHASE DEAL\n\nIn 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the release of $1 billion for the procurement of security equipment to fight Boko Haram insurgents, but the complaints of lack of weapons by soldiers persisted.\n\nIn March, Babagana Monguno, national security adviser (NSA), revealed that funds for arms purchase were missing under the former service chiefs.\n\nSubsequently, in April, Attahiru was invited by the lawmakers over the alleged missing money.\n\nBut in the encounter which was not so friendly, Attahiru told the house of representatives ad hoc committee probing arms purchase by the military that he was new in the office and it would be better the lawmakers invite those who managed the affairs of the army before him.\n\n\u201cThe summation before you speaks to the report before you, it is an executive summary, it is self-explanatory\u2026because when you demanded for this report you stated specifically the areas from which you wanted this report,\u201d he had told the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cYou may wish to recall that the COAS took over the mantle of leadership barely two months ago. The period from which you wanted this report, having been summarised in the executive summary explains whatever details you will require. Issue of procurement that you so demand to know was done by specific individuals.\n\n\u201cI will rather you call these individuals to come and explain to you very specific issues. The general issue has been contained in the report and the summary and the other executive summary is so contained, it goes to speak about the entire report and it explains it.\u201d\n\nIn another meeting with the senate committee on the army, Attahiru said the army needed more funds to tackle insecurity.\n\nHe told the lawmakers that Nigeria is faced with a lot of security challenges that include insurgency in the north-east, banditry in the north-west and parts of north-central, as well as secessionist agitations in the south-east.\n\n\u201cTo curb and finally defeat these threats, the Nigerian army requires equipment, weapons, armour fighting vehicles, platforms, and various combat enablers,\u201d he had told them.\n\n\u201cI urge you to, as a matter of urgency, consider these critical needs as you legislate and appropriate funds.\n\n\u201cI will be counting on your support, so that we can efficiently perform our constitutional roles and defeat all our threats.\u201d\n\nUS/UK TRAINED OFFICER\n\nBorn in Doka, Kaduna North LGA on August 10, 1966, Attahiru attended the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), and commenced the cadet training in 1984.\n\nHe was commissioned as an infantry officer in the rank of a second-lieutenant with the Nigerian Army in December 1986.\n\nRising through the ranks, Attahiru commanded various military formations and operations which include 146 battalion (operation Harmony IV) in the Bakassi Peninsula, 13 Brigade (Operation Pulo Shield), 82 division Nigerian Army.\n\nHe was also theatre commander of Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\nAt different times, he served as deputy director military secretary 2 at the army headquarters, and director of army public relations.\n\nAttahiru had undertaken leadership and security policy courses at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, USA; Graduate School of Media and Communication, Agha Khan University, Kenya; Bournemouth University Disaster Management Center and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.\n\nHe had a master\u2019s degree in strategic management and policy studies from the NDA and master\u2019s in human resources management and development from Salford University in the United Kingdom.\n\nAttahiru who is the 21st chief of army staff will, in the recent time, be the shortest serving chief.\n\nLike they say in the Nigerian military parlance, \u201csoldier go, soldier come\u201d; a new chief is expected to emerge soon from the army hierarchy.",

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWhether Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information remains to be seen.\n\n*An earlier version of this report stated that the NCC asked telcos to register the IMEI numbers of their subscribers; the NCC has now clarified its position",

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",
          "summary": "Here are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch.\nWhereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan.\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app.\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps.",

          "text": "Fast-growing retail distribution platform in Africa joins the leading global entrepreneur support organization\n\nLagos, May 20 \u2014 Endeavor Nigeria has welcomed three new entrepreneurs into its global network. Onyekachi Izukanne, Michael Ukpong, and Ruke Awaritefe, the co-founders of TradeDepot, were selected as Endeavor Entrepreneurs on May 18, 2021, at the 15th Virtual International Selection Panel (v-ISP #15). TradeDepot is a B2B eCommerce platform that allows retailers to order inventory through multiple channels (Mobile, USSD, and WhatsApp) and have it delivered the next day.\n\nWith a mission to build strong entrepreneurship ecosystems in high-growth markets including Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe & North America, Endeavor selects, mentors and accelerates the best high-impact entrepreneurs behind some of the world\u2019s most exciting scale-up companies, supporting them to scale their companies as well as drive economic growth and job creation.

The Endeavor network includes some of the world\u2019s most exciting scale-up entrepreneurs and most experienced mentors and investors. TradeDepot, a Factory-to-Retail distribution platform for Consumer Goods companies, is solving an important problem by organizing and digitizing an industry that affects the lives of millions of Nigerians. We\u2019re excited to support Onyekachi, Michael and Ruke with their mission of connecting retailers to manufacturers with mentorship and guidance as they continue to grow as leaders and scale TradeDepot.\u201d, said Tosin Faniro-Dada, the Managing Director & CEO of Endeavor in Nigeria.\n\nEndeavor Entrepreneur candidates go through a rigorous selection process which culminates in an International Selection Panel (ISP) where candidates are vetted by trusted mentors, drawn from Endeavor\u2019s extensive network of over 4,000 mentors across the world. As part of the process, TradeDepot was presented at the 15th v-ISP and was successfully selected in a unanimous decision by the panelists as part of a cohort of 13 entrepreneurs from 9 markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Kachi, Michael, and Ruke to the Endeavor Entrepreneur network!

TradeDepot\u2019s mission is to consolidate this fragmented informal\n\nretail supply chain, connect the world\u2019s top consumer goods manufacturers to micro retailers on the streets of Africa\u2019s cities and support the informal retail sector with inventory financing to scale and grow.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Does the Nigerian government want safety or surveillance with its new IMEI policy?",
          "text": "From July 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) will require Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralised Equipment Identity Register.\n\nIn May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy released a Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Registration (PDF) that requires Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS), which the NCC would manage.\n\nSome of the reasons given for the Ministry\u2019s action include curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market, discouraging mobile phone theft, enhancing national security, protecting consumer interest, increasing revenue generation for the government, reducing the rate of kidnapping, mitigating the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitating the blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\nThis move follows the Nigerian government\u2019s previous initiatives for digital identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, the Nigerian government released a statement mandating all Nigerians to obtain their National Identification Number (NIN). Predictably, there was a rush as Nigerians all over the country attempted to get their NIN before the deadline at the end of 2020.\n\nThe directive caused a massive uproar among Nigerians because it was given in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a result of that, the deadline was moved to February 2021. Since then, it has been moved thrice, with the new deadline now June 30, 2021.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s IMEI policy will definitely have major implications for the entire nation if implemented.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique number used to identify a mobile phone. It is usually found inside the battery compartment of most phones but can also be gotten by dialling *#06#. With an IMEI number, a phone can be tracked, but more than that, it can also be used for identity theft and even cloning a phone.\n\nEver since the news broke, there has been an understandable outcry, with IMEI and Isa Pantami trending on Twitter.\n\nHowever, while the government requires Nigerians to share this data, they do not have to, as your IMEI is part of the data transmitted to your network operator as soon as you make a call, use data, or send a text.\n\nThis information is rarely ever used beyond providing the details that your phone needs to work. However, security operatives can use it in the case of theft or while tracking terrorist activity.\n\nA few countries, including Azerbaijan, India, Cambodia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Lebanon, already have some form of this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a phone owner possesses their IMEI number, they could provide law enforcement agencies with this information to track these phones if they are stolen.\n\nWhile the reasons given by the government for this new policy appear genuine at first glance, Nigerians are bothered about the possible ways the government can exploit this data.\n\nAn article on The Insider details how the Saudi government uses IMEI numbers to track the location of women who have run away from abusive partners. Most of the doubts expressed regarding the use of this information for surveillance.\n\nIt has not always been used negatively. The ITU reports that implementing this in Great Britain and Turkey resulted in a reduction in mobile phone theft while it increased the number of legally imported mobile devices in Ukraine by 95%, as well as increasing revenues from the import of mobile devices\n\nAccording to a data privacy expert, some of the questions that should be asked include whether there are sufficient safeguards in the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Also, is the government going to be transparent about its use of this data and what happens in the case of a violation?\n\nOne must remember that with the government mandating Nigerians to link their SIM cards to the NIN, the government already has rich insights into the activities of its citizens. Adding IMEI data to this would mean that they can also get real-time location data on anyone.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights history, Nigerians may be right to be suspicious about the motives behind this policy.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Weakest link in cybersecurity chain is people, here\u2019s what SMEs can do",
          "text": "Weakest link in cybersecurity chain is people, here\u2019s what SMEs can do\n\nAt the recent Franco Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) virtual conference on cybersecurity and process automation in today\u2019s business environment, experts reveal how small businesses can protect themselves against cybersecurity threats within and outside the business writes ISAAC ANYAOGU.\n\nWith over 3 billion users connected globally, the internet has brought the world together enabling instant communication, remote work, and business facilitation.\n\n\u201cIt is also come embedded with a multitude of vulnerabilities which poses a significant security threat to users and has led to the emergence of a cybersecurity threat,\u201d said Moses Umoru, the director-general of the FNCCI during a recent webinar held May 19.\n\nRead Also: Why cybersecurity lessons are required for Nigerian children\n\nIn Nigeria, it is estimated that the annual financial loss due to cybersecurity breaches was N250billion in 2017, N280 billion in 2018, N288billion in 2019 and 2020, it increased to over N1trillion in damages.\n\nWhat is even more disconcerting is that experts say that 95 percent of security threats are not reported. So if the figures reported are are these huge, it indicates how much threat to businesses, to profits and operations, cybersecurity presents, Umoru said.\n\nIt is getting even more dangerous, as the coronavirus pandemic has shifted many businesses online, with remote working becoming a common trend, it is bringing the threat of malicious intrusion into the networks of businesses closer to home.\n\nThis is why taking control of the human element which constitutes the weakest link in the security chain is vital, analysts at the virtual conference said.\n\nFunmilola Odumuboni, senior manager, risk advisory at Delloite and Touche, in her presentation said cybersecurity encompasses three main things, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, all factors vulnerable to human errors.\n\nConfidentiality implies that customers\u2019 records, phone numbers, account balances, and other sensitive information do not get into the wrong hands.\n\nIntegrity entails an ability to prevent someone from manipulating a customer\u2019s information. It is the correctness of the information a business is processing and relying on to make decisions.\n\nThen availability speaks to systems and processes not failing, being available so as to prevent an outrage because the business cannot render a service. These are the pain points for businesses when cybersecurity is compromised.\n\nThreat landscape\n\nWith many businesses going online, the threat landscape in Nigeria is evolving. COVID-19 has forced many businesses online faster than they normally would. Many struggling to deal with the impact of the virus are making the right investments to protect themselves online making them vulnerable to new threats.\n\n\u201cIf your business needs to grow, you need technology, now we have remote working, remote customers, so you cannot afford to do business without leveraging technology but also the risks increases,\u201d said Odumuboni.\n\nThis has led to the proliferation of bad actors in cyberspace. \u201cSome people go into cyber crimes as a business and they are looking for low hanging fruits like small businesses to attack and there has been a phenomenal increase in attacks on them. Many have shifted to remote work without the facilities to harden their systems,\u201d said Odumuboni.\n\nThe threat landscape includes hacktivists who in the name of a social cause hack into systems of public and private institutions. During the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria last year, some hacktivists hacked into the website of the Nigerian police.\n\nNation-states are investing in cybersecurity both from a defensive and offensive standpoint.\n\nMalicious insiders, according to some experts constitute over 80 percent of attacks. These are people a business has given some level of access through their network and they want to cause harm.\n\nThreats can also come from rogue suppliers and even competitors.\n\nThese bad actors are after sensitive data including corporate information, board reports, financial information, and investor confidential details.\n\nSome cybercriminals also seek to commit financial fraud such as wire transfers and payments. Some seek to disrupt a business or threaten the health and safety of a community.\n\nAccording to Odumuboni, business email compromise has become rife. It is where the attackers take over an email communication between two organisations for financial gain.\n\nOdumuboni explains that in this situation, a company is talking to another on a financial transaction, cybercriminals intercept that communication and change their account detail.\n\nThe parties, oblivious to this intrusion, continue their interaction and when one party pays, they will pay into the attacker\u2019s account instead of paying into the correct organisation\u2019s account.\n\nThis is becoming rampant now because a lot of organisations are using cloud-based systems for their emails and other processes, many on shared cloud service.\n\nTactics\n\nObukohwo Obukonise, senior systems and cybersecurity engineer at Schneider Electric, in his presentation said there are so many hacking tools available online and most do not require a special skill set.\n\nOne common method used in cyber crimes is phishing in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone, or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data.\n\nRansomeware is another method that is a type of malicious software that is designed to block access to a computer system until a ransom is paid.\n\nThere are also cloud data breaches that describe incidents that have the potential to disclose sensitive information to an unauthorized party.\n\nAnother common attack is a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack)in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.\n\nIn Zero-day attacks, a computer-software vulnerability unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation is introduced and until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers, or a network.\n\nMalware, short for malicious software, consists of code developed by cyber attackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.\n\nThere has been an exponential increase in the creation of malware. Experts estimate that in the last seven years malware has grown from 470million created in 2015 to over 1.2 trillion on the internet today.\n\nOther forms of attacks include negative social media coverage and impersonation, supply chain attacks, and stolen credentials.\n\nMany companies, even if they have smart cybersecurity systems are still susceptible to attacks due to third-party compromise.\n\nBusinesses have relationships with organisations and share information, sometimes their network is even extended to other organisations because of the kinds of businesses they do and if their partners are not implementing the same security procedures, they could become the weak link.\n\nDevelop a strategy\n\nIn many organisations, cybersecurity threats are issues considered at the board level highlighting how important it has become to the well being of a business.\n\nOdumuboni said that organisations need to have a strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have firewalls, but you need a strategy, based on what my organisation does, this is how I will protect my business.\u201d\n\nShe further recommended that business owners need to be aware of the cybersecurity threat landscape, routinely access their networks for vulnerability, maintain visibility across the system to detect threats before they fester, and develop capabilities to respond quickly to attacks.\n\nAccording to Babatunde Abagun, channel manager, West, East, and Central Africa at \u200eNutanix, said research has shown that defensive capabilities of businesses such as antimalware are being eroded by machine learning and artificial intelligence employed by cybercriminals.\n\nOne organisation in the UK that was recently scammed of over $230,000 in phishing attacks, approved payment based on voice approval from the CEO. It turns out that it was AI software that mimicked the voice of the CEO.\n\nAbagun said businesses should protect their people from themselves. \u201cIf you have a child, you will child-proof the house, similarly you need to security-proof your infrastructure not just for threats available now but for those that will come in the future,\u201d said Abagun.\n\nOne way to do this is to establish technologies that actually automate certain processes. Some concepts like list privilege which means giving every individual the minimum amount of capability they require to perform their job function was highly recommended.\n\nA few years ago, the Twitter account of former US President Donald Trump was briefly deactivated by a disgruntled Twitter staff on his last day on the job.

          "text": "The Nigerian economy, which is in dire straits at the moment, is still waiting for the federal government with its intervention in the housing sector as provided for in the economic sustainability plan (ESP) more than 12 months after that plan was inaugurated.\n\nESP is part of the government\u2019s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic aimed to provide stimulus package to businesses and critical sectors. Housing was listed among growth sectors and the strategy was to provide 300,000 housing units yearly.\n\nThe expectation was that the construction of these houses would generate activities in the economy. The strategy envisaged the creation of 1.8 million jobs, starting in 12 months and subsequently creating 1.5 million homes for families across the country.\n\n12 months after, it remains to be seen or heard where these houses, which target low-income earners, are being built. As a result, jobs are not being created, leading to more Nigerians falling into poverty.\n\nAbout 82.9 million Nigerians were in poverty before COVID-19, according to the World Bank. On October 7, 2020, the Bank said that Nigeria, with a poverty rate of 39.1 percent, has the largest poor population (79 million extreme poor) in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 20 percent of the total poor in the region.\n\nRead Also: How Sanwo-Olu is bridging housing deficit in Lagos\n\nThe bank says 10 million Nigerians were forced into poverty as a result of COVID-19, adding that the country\u2019s poor population is set to rise from 82.9 million in 2019 to 90.0 million in 2022 due to natural population growth.\n\nBut with the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis, the national poverty rate is instead forecast to jump from 40.1 percent in 2019 to 45.2 percent in 2022, implying that 100.9 million Nigerians will be living in poverty by 2022.\n\nThis is an unfortunate and worrisome situation which, in part, would have been solved by the ESP strategy on housing and other growth sectors if it had been followed through as planned.\n\nThe strategy which got a N200 billion lifeline from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is an ambitious one which was why it was hailed by housing sector stakeholders even though the 300,000 housing units, according to them, was like a drop of water in an ocean given a 20-million housing deficit.\n\n\u201cFederal government\u2019s decision to build 300,000 houses across the country and also to spend N2 trillion on rural roads construction is a welcome development that will positively impact the economy in various ways,\u201d Femi Akintunde, GMD, Alpha Mead Group, noted.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is a form of reflationary measure that will stimulate economic output through increased spending in housing and infrastructure development. Such investment will create large-scale employment, increase the stock of housing and the provision of additional road infrastructure will help to improve connectivity and ease our logistics challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nAmong other things, the ESP strategy aims at easing bottlenecks in the delivery of social housing and delivering affordable homes through direct government interventions in housing construction.\n\nIt involves working with state governments to identify land for housing construction in all Local Government Areas and targets 100 percent local input for the construction of 400 homes in each Local Government Area.\n\nThe project elements include standardising the design of homes for cost management and industrialisation of the construction process, identifying and selecting delivery partners formed by groups of professionals and artisanal builders as primary delivery channels as well as creating a \u2018homes warehouse\u2019 to buy completed homes from delivery partners, in the absence of ready off-takers.\n\nSimilarly, there were also plans for encouraging private sector involvement and facilitating maturity of the mortgage market that will cater to the needs of middle-class Nigerians while government addresses the needs of low-income earners and the poor.\n\nAll these underpin the concerns raised so far by housing industry stakeholders on the government\u2019s delay and/or slow take-off of the intervention scheme.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s views on possible causes of this delay are varied. While an economist who did not want to be named explained to BusinessDay that government did not have the needed money to build the projected houses, Akintunde blames structural dislocations in the housing sector financing structure.\n\nVictor Onukwugha, President, Association of Housing Corporations of Nigeria (AHCN), was quoted recently as commending the inclusion of the housing sector in the ESP but faulted the actual execution strategies of the project elements which, he noted, were vague without a clear cut plan and roles for executions.\n\n\u201cIt is a year now that the plan was rolled out and from what we can all see, not much has been achieved in easing bottlenecks in the delivery of social housing aside from the purported release of N200 billion by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the project. The second track, which proposes to deliver affordable homes through direct government intervention is still hanging,\u201d he said.",

That fear in itself, was affecting people negatively.\u201d\n\nThe University Don while admonishing journalists on the need to take responsibility for their health, also emphasized adequate and quality rest as well as frequently drinking of clean portable water.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t emphasize drinking of water in this country.\n\nWhen you go abroad, during summer , they emphasize regular drinking of water .\n\nAs you are entering the train , you hear announcement, reminding you not to forget your bottle of water; and their summer is like the AC in my office.\n\n\u201cBut we that live in a sweltry environment don\u2019t drink enough water. Infact, everyone should learn the habit of going about with a bottle of water sipping it frequently because of our weather.\u201d\n\nDr. Uzo while taking particpants through various relaxation techniques which included tension scanning, diaphragmatic or breathing exercise, regular physical exercises (tailored to suit individuals), restful sleep, meditation, number counting during tension or insomnia, managing emotions as well as good nutrition, concluded by saying,\n\n\u201d Research has shown that relaxation exercises are as effective as using tranquilizers in stress management.\u201d\n\nOther facilitators during the webinar included, Mr.Gillo Cutrupi of IFEX, who lectured journalists on the need safeguard their devices and data, as well as avoiding dangerous websites that could negatively impact on their data and devices; and Mr. Fisayo Soyombo writer , investigative journalist and editor, Foundation for Investigative Journalists, who spoke on the theme\u201d Safety /Best Practice In The Investigation, Coverage of Dangerous Assignments\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, the Executive Director of the International Press Centre (IPC), Lanre Arogundade, while welcoming participants to the webinar, said it was a part of a two-part event comprising two webinars on \u201cSafety, Security & Management Of Trauma In Covering Of Dangerous Assignments\u201d organised for journalists in the northern and southern parts of the country and stakeholders forum on the state of press freedom in the country.\n\nSpeaking further, IPC Executive Director, said the activity was one component of a project on enhanced safety awareness for Nigeria journalists being implemented by the IPC with IFEX, a global network of organizations that promotes and defends the right to freedom of expression and information.\n\nArogundade said,\n\n\u201cThis workshop is expected to enhance capacity to manage difficult safety challenges while carrying out our work. Participating journalists are expected to be able to practice with increased confidence and manage dangerous situations .\n\n\u201cwhen the media is constantly attacked and intimidated, the society suffers information scarcity. Government, civil society, businesses, and individuals all loose when the media cannot do it\u2019s job of bringing reliable information to the public.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, the training became imperative because the\n\nimportance of journalists\u2019 safety cannot be over emphasized, especially since journalists have to face the challenge of publicising information in a new and challenging but repressive environment, despite being poorly equipped and in some cases having limited knowledge and skills.\n\nParticipant were drawn from the print, broadcast, online journalists,and bloggers among whom were journalists assaulted or harassed in different ways in the course of covering the current Covid -19 pandemic in the southern States of Nigeria\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nLeader of apex Yoruba sociopolitical organisation, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has expressed concern over what he called undemocratic and reckless shoot-on-sight order against agitators in the Southeast zone of the country by the Acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali, noting that it\u2019s an indication that people of the zone are no longer safe.\n\nThe Acting IGP had on Tuesday last week, declared war on pro Biafra agitators and gunmen attacking and destroying police infrastructure in the Southeast and South-South regions and ordered their complete extermination.\n\nThe police boss who spoke on the sideline while addressing the Police Mobile Force and Special Tactical Squad of the Force in Enugu shortly after he launched Operation Restore Peace, directed policemen in the region not to adhere to the rules of engagement while dealing with Biafra secessionist groups, adding that his job was to protect them.\n\nHe went ahead to threaten police officers who fail to carry out his orders and gets killed in the process.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the media shout; do the job I command you. If anyone accuses you of human rights violation, the report will come to my table and you know what I will do. So, take the battle to them wherever they are and kill them all. Don\u2019t wait for an order,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat another order are you waiting for when Mr. President had ordered you to shoot anybody carrying AK-47 rifle? Quote me, even a dead policeman can be tried and dismissed from the force and his family will not get his benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t seat and wait for them to come; take attack to them and don\u2019t lose your arms to criminals.\u201d\n\nHowever, condemning the order, Adebanjo pointed out that the move is a further escalation of President Muhammadu Buhari government\u2019s hostility towards the Southeast since he took power in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe rising hostility against the South-East Zone since the beginning of the Buhari administration has now become a matter of great concern to Afenifere, as this reality should also become a major concern to other stakeholders in the Nigerian project,\u201d Adebanjo said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe Afenifere leader, who decried the situation where two sets of laws exist in the country; a set of laws where the Fulani go scot free and another, that the lives of others, especially that of the Igbo, do not matter.\n\n\u201cTaking a look at the Security Council, no Igbo man is a member of Buhari\u2019s security architecture. Is that how to run a multi-ethnic multi-religious country like Nigeria?\u201d he queried.\n\n\u201cOne will assume that Nigeria is now a theatre of bloodshed as the streets are now lined with the blood of innocent Nigerians. With this draconian order, no opposition member is safe.\n\nHe said that if the President had no hidden agenda, there were more civilised and democratic ways to beef up security in the South East.\n\nHe urged other leaders in the zones to condemn the shoot-on-sight order to prevent another looming massacre in the South-East zone, saying: \u201cTo prevent yet another looming massacre in the South-East Zone, leaders in other zones should condemn the shoot-on-sight order. The President must be told that if he is sincere about peace and unity of this country, the order should be revoked forthwith. Certainly, if the President has no hidden agenda, there are more civilised and democratic ways to beef up security in the South-East.\u201d",

Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru was a committed soldier whose passion for defending Nigeria was very clear throughout his military career even before his appointment as the Chief of Army Staff.\n\n\u201cSince his appointment, we have engaged him as Northern Governors Forum and individually as Governors, towards enhancing the security and safety of our states, region and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cWithin the few months he held sway, we have seen improvements and high resolve to bringing an end to insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and other criminal activities.\n\n\u201cWe had been working on consolidating this before this tragic incident that took his life and that of others working with him. We are highly shocked and pained\u201d.\n\nThe governor while condoling with President Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian Army, families of the deceased, as well as the entire Nigerian Armed Forces said the incident was deeply regrettable.\n\nHe said the situation should not deter the Armed Forces from giving their best in the service of the nation, just as the deceased COAS, officers and men did before their tragic death.\n\nHe prayed God to grant the deceased eternal rest and comfort their families.\n\nThe Speaker of Kaduna State House of Assembly/Chairman Northern Speakers Forum, Rt.

Honourable Zailani said that besides being the Chief of Army Staff, he was a proud citizen of Kaduna State where he was born and grew up, making the loss even more painful to the government and people of the state.\n\nThe Speaker condoled President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Nasir el-Rufai, the Chief of Defence Staff, the Nigerian Army and his family.\n\nHe charged them to take solace in the fact that he died while serving Nigeria patriotically.\n\n\u201cI pray for the repose of his soul and those that died with him.

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nThe National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, on Friday disclosed that 52 Nigerians have experienced moderate to severe reactions after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nExecutive Director and Chief Executive Officer, NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib disclosed this at a news conference in Abuja.\n\nHe also said 8,439 Nigerians experienced mild Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) after taking the vaccine.\n\nShuaib stated that the 52 Nigerians that experienced moderate to severe reactions to the vaccine were brought down with fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, since the vaccination program was officially rolled out on 15th of April 2021, a total of 8,439 mild Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) have been reported. These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its development partners, have a platform of Senior Supervisors that engage in daily evening review meetings to determine the status of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation in all States & the FCT.\u201d",

Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and other military officers,\u201d a statement signed by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said.\n\nPresident Buhari described the military officers as \u201cheroes who paid the ultimate price for peace and security in the land.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the crash \u201cis one mortal blow to our underbelly, at a time our armed forces are poised to end the security challenges facing the country.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari, according to the statement, pledged that the departed would not die in vain.\n\n\u2018A dedicated officer\u2019\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said the death of the Army Chief was unfortunate coming at a time that the Nigerian military was finding solutions to the security challenges in the country.\n\nIn a statement signed by his spokesperson, Lanre Lasisi, Gbajabiamila said having taken over from the immediate past Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, a couple of months ago, Attahiru has shown a lot of commitment in tackling the security situation in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila, who said he had a few meetings with Attahiru in search of solutions to the challenges, noted that the late Army Chief came across as a core professional officer.\n\nHe said the Nigerian military, especially the Nigeria Army, has lost a dedicated and committed senior officer whose services to fatherland will be sorely missed.\n\n\u2018Highly Pained\u2019\n\nThe Northern Governors Forum, in a statement signed by the office of its Chairman and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, said it was distressed over the sad incident.\n\nLalong said this is another sad day in the history of the nation as it has lost patriotic Nigerians who gave their lives to the defence of the territorial integrity of the country, and also ensuring that its citizens live in peace and security.\n\n\u201cLt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru was a committed soldier whose passion for defending Nigeria was very clear throughout his military career even before his appointment as the Chief of Army Staff,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSince his appointment, we have engaged him as Northern Governors Forum and individually as Governors towards enhancing the security and safety of our States, region and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cWithin the few months he held sway, we have seen improvements and high resolve to bringing an end to insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and other criminal activities.\n\n\u201cWe had been working on consolidating this before this tragic incident that took his life and that of others working with him. We are highly shocked and pained.\u201d\n\nLalong while condoling with the the President and Commander in Chief Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian Army, families of the deceased officers and men, as well as the entire Nigerian Armed Forces said the sad event is deeply regrettable but should not deter the Armed Forces from giving their best in the service of the nation just as the deceased COAS, officers and men did before their tragic death.\n\nHe prayed God to grant the deceased eternal rest and comfort their families.\n\nDevastating to Nigeria\n\nNiger State Governor and Chairman of the North Central States Governors\u2019 Forum, Abubakar Bello, said the death was devastating to the nation at its trying moment of insecurity.\n\nGovernor Sani Bello disclosed this in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Mary Noel-Berje.\n\nHe said the death of COAS and others was coming at a time when the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff along with other Service Chiefs have developed renewed efforts in tackling insecurity in the country.\n\nThe Governor said the late Chief of Army Staff has, within his short time in the office, demonstrated and showed remarkable commitment and professionalism in the course of discharging his duty.\n\nHe called on the family, the Nigerian Army, friends and associates to accept the death as the will of Allah and bear the irreparable loss.\n\nThe Governor enjoined all to pray for the repose of his soul and other officers, and for Allah to give their families the strength to accept their divine call as all souls shall taste death.\n\nA national tragedy\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN described the crash and deaths as a national tragedy.\n\nMalami received the news of the crash of the military aircraft in Kano while attending to guests in preparation for the wedding ceremony of his second son, Abiru Rahman Malami billed for tomorrow, according to a statement from his media office.\n\nHe described the Late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru and members of his team as dedicated patriotic Nigerians whose efforts to improve the security situation of the country was manifest.\n\nMalami prayed Allah to grant eternal salvation for all that lost their lives in the air mishap.\n\nHe also prayed that the family members have the fortitude to bear the loss\n\nThe Minister said the late Army Officer who died in active service to the nation will always be remembered as a selfless and patriotic Nigerian who is passionate in duty.\n\nA shining star\n\nIn his reaction to the disaster, Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, said Lt.Gen. Attahiru was a shining star whose sudden death has robbed Nigeria of an officer striving to bring new drive to secure the country against terrorists and other threats to national security, according to a statement signed by the state\u2019s Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan.\n\n\u201cThe Governor said the news of General Attahiru\u2019s death has left him deeply shaken, with a sense of great personal loss, coming so soon after his appointment had brought immense pride and a sense of hope to the people of Kaduna State,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-Rufai on behalf of the Government and People of Kaduna State, has extended his condolences to President Muhammadu Buhari, all branches of the military, especially the Nigerian Army, and the family of General Attahiru, as well as the families of all the officers who have lost their lives in this national tragedy.\n\n\u201cHe prayed to Allah to forgive their shortcomings and grant them eternal rest, and comfort their families as the nation, grapples with this colossal and very painful loss.\u201d",

          "text": "Israel and Hamas both claimed victory on Friday after their forces ended 11 days of fighting, but humanitarian officials warned that the damage to Gaza would take years to rebuild.\n\nAfter working behind the scenes for days to reach a truce, the White House said Washington had received assurances from the relevant parties that they were committed to the ceasefire.\n\nAs Palestinians and Israelis began to assess the scale of the damage, one Gazan said his neighbourhood looked as if it had been hit by a tsunami. \u201cHow can the world call itself civilised?\u201d Abu Ali asked, standing next to the rubble of a 14-storey tower block.\n\nPalestinian officials put the reconstruction costs at tens of millions of dollars, while economists said the fighting could curb Israel\u2019s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFive more bodies were pulled from Gaza\u2019s rubble, taking the death toll to 248, including 66 children, with more than 1,900 wounded.\n\nThe Israeli military said an Israeli soldier had been killed as well as 12 civilians, including two children. Hundreds were treated for injuries after rocket salvoes caused panic and sent people as far away as Tel Aviv rushing into shelters.\n\nWorld Health Organization spokeswoman Margaret Harris said Gaza\u2019s health facilities were in danger of being overwhelmed by the thousands of injuries.\n\nShe called for immediate access into the Gaza Strip for health supplies and personnel. \u201cThe real challenges are the closures,\u201d she told a virtual UN briefing.\n\nGaza has for years been subjected to an Israeli blockade that restricts the passage of people and goods, as well as restrictions by Egypt.\n\nBoth countries cite concerns about weapons reaching Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza and led the rocket barrage. Palestinians say the restrictions amount to collective punishment of Gaza\u2019s 2 million population.\n\nFabrizio Carboni, regional director of the International Committee of the Red Cross, echoed WHO\u2019s call for urgent medical supplies, adding: \u201cIt will take years to rebuild \u2013 and even more to rebuild the fractured lives.\u201d\n\nUS President Joe Biden said on Thursday that aid would be sent quickly to Gaza, but coordinated with the Palestinian Authority \u2013 Hamas\u2019s Western-backed rival in the occupied West Bank \u2013 \u201cin a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal\u201d.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a televised address to Israelis, saying the operation had damaged Hamas\u2019s ability to launch missiles at Israel.\n\nHe said Israel had destroyed Hamas\u2019s extensive tunnel network, its rocket factories, weapons laboratories and storage facilities, and killed more than 200 militants, including 25 senior figures.\n\n\u201cHamas can\u2019t hide anymore. That\u2019s a great achievement for Israel,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe eliminated an important part of Hamas\u2019s and Islamic Jihad\u2019s command echelon. And whoever was not killed knows today that our long arm can reach him anywhere, above ground or underground.\u201d\n\nIsrael said Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups fired around 4,350 rockets from Gaza during the conflict, of which around 640 fell short into the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military said that 90% of those that crossed the border had been intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defence system.\n\nIran, which does not recognise Israel but supports Hamas and says it has transformed the Palestinian fighters\u2019 arsenal, said they had won a \u201chistoric victory\u201d over Israel. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards warned Israel to expect \u201cdeadly blows\u201d.\n\nHamas chief Ismail Haniyeh cast the fighting as successful resistance to a militarily and economically stronger foe.\n\n\u201cWe will rebuild what the occupation (Israel) destroyed and restore our capabilities,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will not abandon our obligations and duties to the families of martyrs, the wounded and those whose homes were destroyed.\u201d\n\nHaniyeh expressed gratitude to Egyptian, Qatari and U.N. mediators, and to Iran, \u201cwhich has not given up on providing the resistance with money, weapons and technology\u201d.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Muslim states in a statement to \u201csupport the Palestinian people, through military \u2026 or financial support \u2026 or in rebuilding Gaza\u2019s infrastructure\u201d.\n\nEzzat el-Reshiq, a senior member of the Hamas political bureau, told Reuters in Doha the movement\u2019s demands included protection for the Al-Aqsa mosque, and for Palestinians threatened with eviction from their homes in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas hostilities were set off on May 10 in part by Israeli police raids on the Al-Aqsa compound and clashes with Palestinians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThousands gathered there again for this Friday\u2019s prayers, with many demonstrating in support of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli police fired stun grenades towards demonstrators, who threw rocks and petrol bombs at officers, and Palestinian medics said some 20 Palestinians were wounded.\n\nThe confrontations died down within about an hour, with Israeli police pulling back to the compound\u2019s gates.\n\nCivilians on both sides of the Gaza border were sceptical about the chances for peace.\n\n\u201cWhat is truce? What does it mean?\u201d said Samira Abdallah Naseer, a mother of 11 children sitting near the wreckage of a building near Beit Hanoun in the north of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cWe returned to our houses, and we found no place to sit, no water, no electricity, no mattresses, nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a cafe in the Israeli port city of Ashdod, north of Gaza, student Dan Kiri, 25, said Israel should continue attacking Hamas until it collapsed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time until the next operation in Gaza,\u201d he said.\n\nThe truce, mediated by Egypt, appeared to be part of a two-stage deal, with Cairo sending security delegations to Tel Aviv and the Palestinian territories to agree on measures to maintain stability.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jen Psaki said that \u201cour engagement with the leader of Egypt was a key part of that discussion and a key part of bringing an end to the conflict, given their important relationship with Hamas\u201d. Biden on Thursday made his first call to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as president.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to securing a deal was concern from Israel and Hamas about the public reactions from their own side, and their opponents, if they accepted a ceasefire, two Egyptian security sources said.\n\n\u201cIn our negotiations with the two parties, we depended on the need for each of them to see the scale of the damage done to civilians, and we charged each party with its criminal and international liabilities towards civilians,\u201d one of the sources said.",

          "text": "The first convoys of humanitarian aid have arrived in Gaza, hours after a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants came into effect.\n\nThousands of Palestinians returned home to scenes of devastation with officials saying reconstruction might take years.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) called for the creation of corridors for injured people to be evacuated.\n\nMore than 250 people were killed in the 11-day conflict, most of them in Gaza. Both Israel and Hamas claimed victory.\n\nTrucks from various aid agencies, including those affiliated with the United Nations, started bringing much-needed medicine, food and fuel into Gaza, after Israel reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing.\n\nMore than 100,000 people had to flee their homes in the territory, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas, and nearly 800,000 people did not have access to piped water, the UN children\u2019s agency Unicef said.\n\nPalestinian officials say tens of millions of dollars will be needed to rebuild the already impoverished enclave that is also suffering with Covid-19.\n\nMargaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the WHO, called for immediate access for health supplies and personnel, saying the territory\u2019s health facilities risked being overwhelmed by thousands of injuries.\n\nFor years, Gaza has been subjected to Israeli and Egyptian restrictions on the passage of people and goods, with both countries citing concerns about weapons reaching Hamas.\n\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unwra) said its priority was to identify and help tens of thousands of displaced people, and that it was urgently seeking $38m (\u00a326m) in aid.\n\nOn Thursday, Gaza\u2019s housing ministry said 1,800 housing units were unfit for living and 1,000 had been destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe damage inflicted in less than two weeks will take years, if not decades, to rebuild,\u201d said Fabrizio Carboni, the Middle East director for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\n\nSamira Abdallah Nasser, said her two-storey house near Beit Hanoun was hit by a blast during the fighting, reducing it to ruins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re back to our homes and we don\u2019t have a place to sit, we don\u2019t have water, we don\u2019t have electricity, we don\u2019t have beds, we don\u2019t have anything,\u201d she told Reuters news agency. \u201cWe\u2019re back to our fully destroyed homes.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Azhar Nsair, told the Associated Press news agency: \u201cWe see such huge destruction here, it\u2019s the first time in history we\u2019ve seen this.\u201d\n\nThe fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza began on 10 May after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension that culminated in clashes at al-Aqsa, a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews, in occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nHamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\n\nAt least 248 people, including more than 100 women and children, were killed in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Israel has said it killed at least 225 militants during the fighting. Hamas has not given casualty figures for fighters.\n\nIn Israel 13 people, including two children and an Israeli soldier, were killed, its medical service says.\n\nMany Jewish families emerged from bomb shelters. Emergency restrictions have been lifted while all schools are due to reopen on Sunday.\n\nThe Israeli army said militants fired more than 4,300 rockets during the conflict, of which 90% were intercepted by its air defences. But rockets still got through, slamming into homes, synagogues and other buildings.\n\nMany of those rockets were fired at cities in southern Israel, such as Ashkelon, where Tammy Zamir told Reuters she was happy the conflict was over but was \u201ccertain there will be another escalation\u201d.\n\nIn the nearby city of Ashdod, 25-year-old Dan Kiri said Israel should continue attacking Hamas until it collapsed, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time until the next operation in Gaza\u201d.\n\nThe ceasefire was tested by clashes at the al-Aqsa compound after Friday prayers. Israeli police fired stun grenades at Palestinian demonstrators, who threw rocks and petrol bombs at officers. At least 20 Palestinians were injured, medics said.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden said a two-state solution was the only way to resolve the conflict, adding that there could be no peace unless the region unequivocally recognised the right of Israel to exist. He also said the US would organise international help to rebuild the damage in Gaza.\n\nGaza\u2019s streets are bursting back into life with the truce only hours old. It\u2019s the first time in nearly a fortnight people have been able to go outside in relative safety. Entire families step over rubble and children tiptoe through smashed glass.\n\nThey look up at wrecked buildings but seem to take it in their stride. Perhaps seeing the aftermath is easy compared with the terrifying experience of living through the airstrikes themselves.\n\nOn one street in the heart of Gaza City is the remnants of al-Sharouq building. Its name means sunrise. It lies in charred ruins. The block was the third high-rise bombed by Israel which said militants used it.\n\nA car drives past and a child in a keffiyeh \u2013 a Palestinian headscarf \u2013 stands out of the sunroof with his fingers in a victory sign.\n\nHamas is hailing its \u201cdefence of Jerusalem\u201d. Israel says its airstrikes have set the group back strategically. People here are welcoming calm, but know it probably just means a countdown to the next inevitable conflict.",

We achieved our goals, we did it with passion and we did it together,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I want to thank the supporters, who have all played such an important part in helping us reach new heights for Wolves, and the people of the city, who embraced us and made us feel at home.\n\n\u201cI, of course, want to thank all of the staff at Wolves, for their support and total commitment, every single day.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, I want to thank each-and-every player that we\u2019ve worked with since the day we started, for their loyalty, their dedication, hard work and talent. They are the ones who have made this amazing journey possible for us.\n\n\u201cSunday will be a very emotional day, but I am so happy that the fans will be back in Molineux and we can share one last special moment together, as one pack.\u201d\n\nNuno signed a three-year deal on his arrival in the Midlands in May 2017, days after he was sacked by Porto at the end of a trophy-less season.\n\nIn his first season at Molineux, he won the Championship title with two games to spare leading the club back to the Premier League after a six-year absence, which earned him a contract extension until June 2021.\n\nHe established Wolves as Premier League regulars in the following seasons, securing back-to-back seventh-placed finishes which earned the club a spot in the Europa League, their first European qualification in 39 years.\n\nAfter three qualifying rounds which included victory over Serie A side Torino, Wolves came second in a group including Braga, Besiktas and Slovan Bratislava.\n\nTheir European path was interrupted by a late 1-0 defeat to eventual winners Sevilla at the quarter-final stage.\n\nWolves executive chairman Jeff Shi praised Nuno\u2019s influence at the club and says the return of fans at Molineux on Sunday will provide the manager a fitting farewell as he seeks a new challenge.\n\n\u201cNuno has brought us some incredibly special moments at Wolves that will never be forgotten, but every chapter comes to an end,\u201d Shi said.\n\n\u201cHis loyalty and dedication over the last four years has been immeasurable, and we cannot thank him enough for the progress he has made for Wolves.\n\n\u201cSunday was already going to be a very special day, welcoming our supporters back for the first time in more than a year; but it will also now be a fitting goodbye for someone who will forever remain an important part of Wolves history.\u201d\n\nTottenham have distanced themselves from the Portuguese boss for their own managerial vacancy, with the Molineux departure believed to not be linked to any role another club.",
