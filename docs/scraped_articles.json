          "text": "Tinubu Campaign Organisation has warned against the imposition of a consensus candidate by the All Progressives Congress.\n\nThe organisation was reacting to the announcement of Senate President Ahmed Lawan as consensus candidate of the party on Monday.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Legal Director, Babatunde Ogala, SAN, the support group listed three conditions for picking a consensus candidate as stipulated in the Electoral Act.\n\nTne statement read, \u201cThe media is inundated with reports that the Chairman of the All progressives Congress (APC) has unilaterally announced the purported adoption of a certain aspirant the consensus presidential candidate of the APC for the forth coming presidential election in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhile the National Chairman is yet to deny or offer any clarification on the alleged declaration, it is necessary to state that such a declaration is a legal impossibility.\n\n\u201cThis is because under the regime of the Electoral Act 2022, consensus, though provided for as one of the means by which a political party may produce its candidate, must specifically occur in a precise form.\n\n\u201cSection 84(9) (10) and (11) of the Electoral Act 2022 are the relevant provisions and they state as follows:\n\n\u201c(9) A political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirant for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate\u201d.\n\n\u201c(10) Where a political party is unable to secure a written consent of all cleared aspirants for the purpose of a consensus candidate, it shall revert\n\nto the choice of direct or indirect primaries for the nomination of candidates for the aforesaid elective position.\n\n\u201c(11) A special convention or nomination congress shall be held to ratify the choice of consensus candidates at designated centers at the National,\n\nState, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies, as the case may be\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstructively, none of the above conditions have occurred in respect of producing the presidential candidate of the APC. Therefore, any declaration of a consensus candidate would be premature and a violation of extant provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that as a law-abiding entity, the APC will not be part of such. We are further persuaded to urge our supporters to disregard this report\n\nconsidering that the overwhelming majority of the APC Northern Governors who, after meeting with the President, re-affirmed their preference for a\n\npresident from the Southern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis patriotic decision is widely accepted by all Nigerians as a demonstration of deep understanding of the nuanced fault lines of our nation.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstance, a unilateral declaration by the National Chairman of aconsensus presidential candidate for the party will not only violate the law, but set the party on collision course with its Governors who are critical stakeholders in the party.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A peace ambassador, Kingsley Muturu has won the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election for Bomadi state constituency in Delta State.\n\nAmbassador Muturu, who hails from Bomadi Community in Bomadi LGA, Delta State, polled 32 votes to defeat his closest challenger Ojoto Okubo, who scored 12 votes in what has been described as a transparent, peaceful and keenly-contested primary election. The primary election is preparatory to 2023 general election into the state House of Assembly.\n\nMuturu, who has been described by his supporters as a passionate philanthropist attributed his victory to God and the will of the people of Bomadi. He promised to engage in a massive door-to-door campaign because according to him, the work ahead is daunting.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this victory to God and to the common people of Bomadi who did not forget where we are coming from. The work ahead is huge. Now the real work starts. We shall not relent. We are going to leverage on the enthusiasm of the common people to see someone close to them represent them at the state house of assembly; someone they know has their interest at heart.\n\n\u201cWe can see victory ahead. God has willed it and the people will perfect it during the 2023 general election,\u201d Ambassador Muturu said.\n\nSpeaking after the victory, a supporter of Ambassador Muturu, Comrade Accra Andrew lamented the poor representation and lack of any dividends of democracy. The people of Bomadi have suffered since the return to democracy in 1999.\n\nAccording to him, despite having some political big wigs from Bomadi in government, there is nothing the people can boast of in terms of infrastructure. \u201cThe senator representing our senatorial district is from Bomadi. We have a member of House of Reps from here, there is also a member of the state house of assembly. We have two commissioners and some special advisers, but Bomadi cannot boast of electricity, no cottage hospital, no borehole for potable water. In fact there is nothing on ground to suggest that these people come from here.\n\n\u201cThis explains the wild jubilation you witnessed when Ambassador Muturu emerged as the candidate of APC for House of Assembly because as a private citizen with just his foundation, he has been able to touch lives. He has given scholarships to those that wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to school, he has paid hospital bills for widows and the aged, he has intervened in many ways than one to provide the most basic of things to the Downtrodden here.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there are some aged people that he gives stipends at the end of the month. So you could now know the reason for the jubilation and optimism by the poorest of the poor in Bomadi. This shows the huge support he enjoys amongst the voters and the hope he inspires even amongst the youths. I can assure you that Ambassador, being on the ballot for this election is the best thing that has happened to Bomadi people in a long while and the people have vowed that all his good works in this community shall not go unrewarded,\u201d Comrade Andrew enthused.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Cynthia Alo & Joseph Oso\n\nThe youth initiatives for Advocacy, Growth and advancement (YIAGA) Africa has stated that Nigeria is in a stage where the 2023 elections will be decided by the young people.\n\nYiaga Africa hosted a Roundtable meeting with young groups and civil society organizations for the purpose of mobilizing and engaging youths for CRV and PVC collection in Lagos.\n\nAddressing journalists after the meeting, Executive Director, Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo said \u2018\u2019The 2023 elections is about the young people because demographically they actually have the population. They will be here for the next 20 to 30 years. So the choices that they make today will determine their future,\n\nSo it is going to be an election about the young people and they have to make their numbers count and the only way they are going to make their numbers count is if they collect their PVC and they vote for leaders of their choice\u2019\u2019.\n\nExpressing his disappointment on the number of youths who came out to vote in the last elections in 2019,he said that the nation is in a stage where young people are not showing interest in the electoral process of the country, not to talk of voting during elections.\n\n\u2018\u2019In 2019, only 28% of young people who are registered voted at the presidential elections and 29% of them at the governorship election.\n\nSo you can see that less than 30% of young registered voters are actually turning out to vote and that is very bad and that\u2019s why we are concerned and worried. But we are doing something about it, which is getting more young people to get registered and prepare them to vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we are also making another point that if 60% of young people show up, and they are 60% of uninformed young people, then Nigeria is not going to change. So we have to get a lot of informed young people out to vote at the election. By doing so, they are voting for candidates from presidential, to state house of assembly, to the national assembly, down to governorship. They are voting candidates that have the capacity, competence, and character to hold public offices and not voting based on sentiment.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that Yiaga Africa in partnership with INEC will be organising a concert tagged \u2018\u2019Youth Vote Count 2.0\u2019\u2019 on the 11th of June, 2023 at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) in Lagos with the aim of getting 100,000 young voters registered.\n\n\u2018\u2019This time we are raising it and our goal is to get about a 100,000 young voters registered using the youth vote count which holds on the 11th of June at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) and what is interesting about this youth vote count 2.0 is that INEC is going to be registering voters at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) from the 6th to the 11th because the entry permit into the concert venue is your PVC or the voter registration slip. So registration will be taking place by INEC and INEC will set about 30 registration points at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), so we are inviting unregistered voters to come there and get registered. The goal is to reach a hundred thousand in each state that the concert will hold directly and get them on the voters register that will be 600,000.\n\nThe youth votes count concert that on 11th June in Lagos, we are flagging off from Lagos and then we will go to Abuja. The plan is to go to 6 cities and in the 6 geo political zones like we did in 2019 where we went round 6 universities when INEC was registering voters while the event was taking place and in 2019 through the youth vote count INEC registered 25,000 students. So the goal is to reach 100,000 in each state directly and get them on the voters register. With this alone we have a chance of getting 600,000 young voters\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr. Samson commended INEC towards the introduction of online registration which is the first of its kind in Nigeria electoral process but still urged the body to plan ahead so as to increase the use of technology for electoral process.\n\n\u2018\u2019I think for the 2027 elections we\u2019ve got to prepare to increase our use of technology for the electoral process and whatever that translates at least we have a law now that allows INEC to experiment with electronic voting.\n\nSo maybe after the 2023 elections we should incrementally introduce electronic voting machines in this whole value chain of electoral technology that the country seems to have adopted in the last 10years,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "By Cynthia Alo & Joseph OsoThe youth initiatives for Advocacy, Growth and advancement (YIAGA) Africa has stated that Nigeria is in a stage where the 2023 elections will be decided by the young people.\nAddressing journalists after the meeting, Executive Director, Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo said \u2018\u2019The 2023 elections is about the young people because demographically they actually have the population.\n\u2018\u2019In 2019, only 28% of young people who are registered voted at the presidential elections and 29% of them at the governorship election.\nSo you can see that less than 30% of young registered voters are actually turning out to vote and that is very bad and that\u2019s why we are concerned and worried.\nWith this alone we have a chance of getting 600,000 young voters\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor; Jide Orintunsin, Bolaji Ogundele, Tony Akowe, Nicholas Kalu, Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja and Emmanuel Badejo\n\nNWC rejects chairman\u2019sposition\n\nNorth\u2019s governors insist on power shift to South\n\nRuling All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday erupted in confusion over a purported \u2018choice consensus candidate\u2019 of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nTwenty-four hours to the convention, National Chairman Abdullahi Adamu sparked a row when he announced Senate President Ahmad Lawan as the President\u2019s anointed.\n\nHe told the National Working Committee (NWC) of Lawan\u2019s choice during a meeting, but the members rejected the proposal.\n\nDisowning Adamu, they aligned with APC northern governors\u2019 position that power should return to the South.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari met with the governors, who restated their power shift resolution.\n\nHe told the governors that his push for a consensus candidate did not mean he had an anointed contender.\n\nHe said no one would be allowed to impose a candidate on the party and that delegates would decide the fate of the aspirants.\n\nThe governors were led to the meeting by the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong.\n\nPresident Buhari, according to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, told the states\u2019 helmsmen that he had \u201cno preferred candidate\u201d and had \u201canointed no one\u201d.\n\nHe said he was determined to ensure that \u201cthere shall be no imposition of any candidate on the party\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari said the party members must be respected and made to feel they are important.\n\nHe said he had a clear mind about what he was doing and asked the APC governors to feel the same way because \u201cyou were elected as I was\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cHave a clear mind as I have. God gave us the chance; we have no reason to complain. We must be ready to take pain as we take joy.\n\n\u201cAllow the delegates to decide. The party must participate, nobody will appoint anybody.\u201d\n\nLalong and Progressive Governors Forum Chairman and Kebbi State Governor Abubakar Bagudu said they had come to reaffirm the Northern governors\u2019 position on power shift.\n\nLalong told reporters: \u201cThis meeting is also in line with part of the consultations that Mr. President had.\n\n\u201cOf course, Mr. President had a meeting with us governors, but at the APC Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, we sat down.\n\n\u201cWe reviewed a lot of things and we discussed at length the unity of this country, the need for progress and the need for inclusiveness, and also the need for accommodation.\n\n\u201cWe sat down in the last few days and 13 out of 14 governors agreed. We decided to go and advise Mr. President.\n\n\u201cI think part of the discussions that we had leaked to the press.\n\n\u201cWe still went ahead and we told Mr. President. Being a democrat, he said he must listen to us; he would listen to us. And so, Mr. President granted the opportunity.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to reaffirm our position in that statement. We also apologised to him that that statement was made by all of us and we reaffirmed the position, but we apologised that the statement leaked before even our consultations with him.\n\n\u201cI am sure this may be the last of consultations. So, we are directed that after this, the Chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum has also summoned a meeting (yesterday), after which we\u2019ll make further suggestions to Mr. President.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of unity and peace, we recommended that the next President should come from the South.\u201d\n\nOn why Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, was absent, his Kaduna counterpart, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, explained that the presidential aspirant did not agree with his colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe governor of Kogi State chose to excuse himself from meeting with Mr. President because he believes that he does not agree with our position.\n\n\u201cThere are 14 APC governors out of the 19 Northern states.\n\n\u201cThirteen of us are on one page on this subject and we all came to see the President, but the governor of Kogi State excused himself and it is within his democratic rights to excuse himself.\n\n\u201cBut 12 out of 14 is a supermajority. Thirteen out of 14 is an even bigger supermajority and the 13 of us met with the President.\n\n\u201cWhat our leader has communicated to you is a summary of the discussions with Mr. President,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\nAlso at the meeting were Governors Abubakar Baduru (Jigawa), Babagana Zulum (Borno), Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), Bello Matawale (Zamfara), Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Yahaya Inuwa (Gombe), Abubakar Bello (Niger), Abdulrahman Abdulrazak (Kwarra) and Mai Mala Buni (Yobe).\n\nNWC divided\n\nThe NWC was divided over the choice of Lawan as the choice candidate.\n\nNational Organising Secretary, Suleiman Mohammed Argungu, told reporters after the NWC meeting that members stood with the Northern governors on the power shift.\n\nAccompanied by 11 NWC members, including four National Vice Chairmen, he said Adamu was only expressing his opinion.\n\nArgungu said: \u201cWe were briefed by our National Chairman, who informed us that the Senate President is the consensus candidate for the APC National Convention.\n\n\u201cThat is just the information he gave us and not an issue that was discussed on the floor of the NWC.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, a few days ago, the Northern governors met and decided that the leadership of this country should shift to the South. The southern governors also affirmed that.\n\n\u201cWe the members of the NWC are also with the governors on what they have said.\n\n\u201cJust a few minutes ago, the governors of the party from the North went to the presidency to inform the President that they stood on what they said regarding the presidency of this country.\n\n\u201cWhat the National Chairman told us was just information and all of us are entitled to our opinions because we are all democrats and we can exercise our opinion.\n\n\u201cThis was never deliberated by the NWC. It is information given to us at the NWC and so, we don\u2019t have a divided house.\u201d\n\nA source at the meeting said: \u201cThe National Chairman informed the NWC this morning (yesterday) that the Senate President was chosen as the consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cWe listened to him and the issue was rested. We did not discuss the information talk less of ratifying it. Take it to the bank; NWC did not discuss it or take any decision on a consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that majority of NWC members are for elective primary and not consensus.\u201d\n\nAnother member added: \u201cThe consensus candidate announced by the chairman was a personal expression and not the decision of the NWC.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu: Adamu on his own\n\nOndo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu chided Adamu over his unilateral announcement of Senator Lawan as the consensus candidate.\n\nHe said in a statement that the pronouncement was contrary to the position of Northern governors on zoning to the South.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cMy attention has just been drawn to the expensive joke purportedly enacted by the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\n\u201cThe speculation is rife that the Chairman took a flight of fancy and decided to make a pronouncement beyond his competence.\n\n\u201cHe has, allegedly, made public his preferred choice as the candidate of the APC for the Office of the President in the next general elections.\n\n\u201cThis alleged pronouncement runs contrary to the position of the majority of Northern Governors in APC and their counterparts in the South. Our agreement is unanimous on this issue.\n\n\u201cThe office of the President should be contested for by qualified persons from the Southern part of the country if the move to get a consensus candidate fails. There has been no shift from this settled issue.\n\n\u201cLet it be known that the Chairman or anyone who holds a contrary opinion does so at a personal level. He is at best embarking on a frolic that reasonable people will consider dangerous.\n\n\u201cWe are grieving but have not forgotten that power must shift to the south. On this, we stand.\u201d\n\nAbdulRazaq backs power shift\n\nKwara State Governor Abdulrahman AbdulRazaq affirmed that he was part of the Northern leaders\u2019 resolution for the North-South power shift.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Political Communications, Bashir Adigun, the governor said: \u201cWe have been inundated with enquiries on whether our Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq supports the resolution of Northern leaders on power shift to Southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe like to state emphatically that the governor was ab initio fully part of the meeting and resolution of the Northern leaders that the next President should come from the Southern part of the country.\u201d\n\n\u2018Adamu must resign\u2019\n\nAn APC chieftain in Delta State, Sunny Mene, urged Adamu to resign.\n\nHe said the National Chairman displayed bias by unilaterally suggesting Lawan.\n\n\u201cMembers of APC all over Nigeria are shocked by the conduct of the National Chairman, who wrongly claimed that President Buhari had chosen an APC presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cBy his pronouncement, he exhibited bias and compromised his position as National Chairman.\n\n\u201cHe should therefore resign immediately. We are indeed happy that the President has a refuted his claim.\u201d\n\nSome delegates also demanded Adamu\u2019s resignation.\n\nA delegate from Niger State said: \u201cI no longer have confidence in Adamu to continue as APC National Chairman.\u201d",

          "text": "Some officials of Nigeria Air are in Europe shopping for aircraft, the management of the national carriers said yesterday.\n\nThe management blamed the delay in the airline\u2019s takeoff on the stringent requirements that must be met before the commencement of commercial operation by airlines.\n\nAccording to its interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Captain Dapo Olumide, the impact of COVID-19 on the industry and the constant flight delays and cancellations in Europe hampered the process for the acquisition of aircraft.\n\nHe spoke in Abuja while receiving the Air Transport License (ATL) from the Director-General of Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Captain Musa Nuhu.\n\nThe CEO allayed fears that Nigeria Air might go under like the previous national carrier \u2013 Nigerian Airways.\n\nPresenting the licence, Nuhu said: \u201cThe ATL process is a step and one of the certificates required towards schedule passenger operations and it is a big step forward in the processing of the Air Operating Certificate (AOC) which is presently ongoing.\n\n\u201cThis ATL has gone through all the processes. Congratulations and we look forward to you fulfiling the remaining requirements for the AOC so that we can hand over the AOC certificate to you.\n\n\u201cWelcome on board and we hope you guys will start flying soon like other operators in Nigeria, we hope you actively participate in the Single Africa Air Transport Market (SATM) for the benefit of the national economic growth and greater contribution from the aviation industry to the GDP.\u201d\n\nCaptain Olumide explained while the carrier had not taken off.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe first aircraft will be here shortly. The reason why one of the persons in the team is not here is because he is in Europe at the moment sourcing for the aircraft.\n\nRead Also: Enforcement of okada ban begins in Lagos\n\n\u201cThe aircraft are available but there are all sorts of issues because this is summer peak period and as you know\u2026 post-COVID. All the aircraft were parked in the desert.\n\n\u201cThe airlines are bringing them out slowly, it takes time to bring an aircraft out of storage and there is a further complication; a lot of flights in Europe are being cancelled or delayed because everybody was laid off during the COVID and they don\u2019t have enough staff in the airports to turn around flights.\n\n\u201cSo, there is a lot of cancellation going on. It is very difficult to get the aircraft but we have discussions going on with providers of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and we are just waiting for the right terms of the agreement.\n\n\u201cWe already have aircraft identified because that is one of the requirements for the NCAA but we are just trying to perfect titles and so on.\u201d\n\nOn the likely date the airline would begin operation, the chief executive said: \u201cThere is a process to issuing an Air Operating Certificate (AOC). When you have an AOC and ATL, you can commence commercial schedule operation for hire and reward. The date is largely based on the process that one is following to get the AOC.\n\n\u201cIt is not something that can be issued because they like my face, there are five steps and you have to go through all the steps and we are working around the clock. That explains why the other team members are not here. They are working round the clock to set up this airline and to meet those stringent requirements.\n\n\u201cThe stringent nature of the requirement is why the ATL we have today has taken long to be issued because there are processes to go through, no magic wand. We are doing the same thing for the AOC, when we have that certificate, we will commence operation.\u201d\n\nOn what the national carrier hopes to achieve, Olumide said: \u201cWe want to bring Nigeria closer to the world, we want more people to have access to Nigeria and more people from Nigeria to go out of this country.\n\n\u201cThere are over 80 BASAs and you will agree with me that with our existing infrastructure, we are not utilising these BASAs.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a national airline, you can deploy capacity to those major routes. It is not about revenue drive but exposure and we have airlines serving these markets. The more Nigeria is involved in this, the greater the addition to the economy of the country.\u201d\n\nOn the fear that Nigeria Air may fail like Nigerian Airways, he said: \u201cNigeria Airways was government-owned and government-run. But this one is a Nigerian airline that has been midwifed to hand over to Nigerian institutional investors who will own 51percent at the minimum of the airline and that is very different from what we had in the past.\n\n\u201cThis airline will have a minimum stake of 51percent investors, the government will have 5 percent and the rest will be to strategic equity partner. This is something we need in Nigeria to give us international credibility and access to the market.\u201d",

          "title": "Tinubu tipped to win APC presidential race",
          "text": "By Joseph Jibueze, Deputy News Editor\n\nFrontline presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is projected to be ahead in the party\u2019s presidential primaries slated for today and tomorrow in Abuja.\n\nA number of factors make Tinubu the candidate to beat. The factors are: nationwide recognition, reach, structure, support, endorsements, mass appeal, track records as governor of Lagos State, rich experience in both the private and public sectors.\n\nTinubu, along with President Buhari, is a co-founder of the APC.\n\nHe has mentored politicians across the country, many of who became governors, senators, House of Representatives members, or were elected or appointed through his support.\n\nTinubu, as APC National Leader, has profound influence on the key structures of the party in many states.\n\nHe also has the backing of more governors than his rivals.\n\nWith governors having tremendous influence on the delegates \u2013 three per local government \u2013 Tinubu can feel confident about emerging his party\u2019s torch-bearer and a potential face-off with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) President candidate Atiku Abubakar in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe APC northern governors, in a communiqu\u00e9 at the end of their Abuja meeting on Saturday, advised President Muhammadu Buhari to restrict his search within the party for a successor to the southern states.\n\nThey said power shift to the South would be in the interest of building a stronger, more united and more progressive country.\n\nBased on the decision, Jigawa State Governor Mohammed Badaru withdrew from the race.\n\nIn the South, the Southwest is the bastion of the APC.\n\nTinubu is the clear favourite in the geo-political zone. He is also being backed strongly by most of the states in the North.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo may get his votes from Ogun which is his home state and Nasarawa where he is believed to be backed by the state governor.\n\nFormer Minister of Transportation Mr. Chibuike Rotmi Amaechi may get his votes from his home state, Rivers, and Plateau where he is being backed by the state governor.\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi may get his votes from Ekiti, Jigawa where the governor is his friend. He may also get some votes from Kebbi because of his closeness to the state governor.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan is being backed by his state, Yobe and states in the Southeast.\n\nOf all the contenders, Tinubu best fits President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s description of the candidate of his choice.\n\nThe President recommended a party man who must be formidable, who appeals to the electorate across the board.\n\nProjection as at today:\n\nTinubu is projected to win Kano, Lagos, Oyo, Borno, Sokoto, Bauchi, Osun, Benue, Ondo, Edo, Katsina, Gombe, Niger, Kaduna, Zamfara and Adamawa states.\n\nOsinbajo: Ogun and Nasarawa.\n\nYahaya Bello: Kogi\n\nAmaechi: Rivers and Plateau\n\nLawan: Yobe, Kebbi (strong), Abia, Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra and Enugu.\n\nFayemi: Ekiti, Jigawa and Kebbi (partially)\n\nAkpabio: Akwa Ibom\n\nAyade: Cross River\n\nUndecided states: Delta and Bayelsa.\n\nLast-minute\u2019s horse trading intensified last night in Abuja. Chances are that some of the aspirants may step down after a realistic assessment of their chances.\n\nIf Yahaha Bello, who has disagreed with fellow APC governor\u2019s from the North, withdraws from the race, he may ask his supporters to vote for the Senate President.\n\nIt is also likely that Akpabio and Ayade may withdraw from the race. It was, however not clear who they will endorse and then ask their supporters to vote for.\n\nFor Osinbajo and Fayemi, some of their delegates may abandon them at the venue of the primary if they are now fully convinced that they both stand no chance of winning and then vote for Tinubu with the brightest prospect of clinching the ticket. Supporters of other aspirants may be similarly inclined.\n\nA lot will depend on what happened between press time and the time for voting.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Four rising sectors in Africa's technology ecosystem",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem had its best year ever in 2021 when it raised $5.2 billion (per Partech data), and it was predicted by investment tracking platform, Africa: The Big Deal, that the continent is on its way to raising $7 billion in 2022. It is not a surprise that fintech dominated last year\u2019s total funding, accounting for 63% or $3 billion of the funding that went to African startups. This year, so far, African startups have raised $2.1 billion, according to data from TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker, with fintech still leading the way with $660 million.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t look like fintech\u2019s dominance will wane anytime soon in Africa, there are other sectors on the continent getting significant funding, and you should be paying attention to them.\n\n1. AI\n\nBefore this year, African startups struggled to be involved in the AI conversation. In 2020, when AI companies globally attracted $36 billion, AI companies on the continent could only raise $11.63 million. There were concerns that Africa would be left behind in the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to this slow pace in catching up with AI development, which threatens the future of Africans in an increasingly digital world. But one startup was all it took to bring Africa\u2019s AI industry to prominence. InstaDeep.\n\nCompany to watch: InstaDeep\n\nFounded in 2014 in the Tunisian city of Tataouine, InstaDeep\u2019s decision-making AI design allows it to boost productivity across a wide range of companies and industries. In the global AI race, dominated by the US and China, InstaDeep is the only African startup involved in shaping the evolution of the technology.\n\nIn January, it raised $100 million\u2014the only record funding into the African AI industry this year\u2014solidifying hopes that Africa can play on the global AI scene. It is being primed to take on massive projects such as creating an early-warning system for COVID-19 and a predictive railway timing system.\n\n2. Edtech\n\nAfter the pandemic disrupted education, the world turned to edtech solutions to continue learning in an efficient and effective way. While many edtech companies around the world benefited from this, as the industry attracted an influx of funding, African edtech companies struggled to tap into this opportunity. In 2021, when edtech globally raised $20 billion, African edtech companies raised less than $40 million. But Africa has an education crisis, which sees over 100 million children out of school across different educational levels on the continent. While there isn\u2019t a funding boom yet in edtech in Africa, there is a huge market here. There have been impressive efforts by African companies to solve the continent\u2019s educational problems.\n\nCompany to watch: Ulesson and FoondaMate\n\nUlesson\n\nNigerian startup, Ulesson was Africa\u2019s most funded edtech platform last year, raising $22.5 million across 2 funding rounds. Ulesson\u2019s work can be seen as pioneering for the edtech space; it brought Tencent and Owl Ventures, some of the world\u2019s biggest edtech investors, to the continent through its funding rounds.\n\nFoondaMate\n\nSouth African startup, FoondaMate teaches high school students using a WhatsApp bot that looks like 2 friends chit-chatting. Last month, FoondaMate raised $2 million to expand its unorthodox solution to more high school students in the country. WhatsApp is the most popular social media app in Africa, with 192 million users, as of 2018. In Foondamate\u2019s country of primary operation, South Africa, 95% of South Africans say they use their WhatsApp every month. FoondaMate told TechCabal that it has helped over 400,000 students cutting across more than 10 languages from over 30 countries, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia, targets 50 million users in the next few years and is willing to expand to achieve that.\n\n3. Cleantech\n\nSeventy-five percent of the world\u2019s population without access to electricity and renewable energy sources reside in Africa. Increased funding in clean energy by investors will help Africa fill this deficit. This has also made cleantech the closest industry to upsetting fintech this year, if the current momentum is maintained. The biggest funding ticket on the continent so far went to a cleantech company, making it the second most funded industry so far, this year.\n\nCompany to watch: Sun King\n\nSolar company, Sun King, raised $260 million in a Series D round to expand access to off-grid power to customers in Africa and Asia. It reported that it reached 18 million people in a decade of operations in Kenya, and is tripling its customers in Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania. Sun King said it will use $100 million to expand its pay-as-you-go solution and allow users to power bigger home appliances in the markets it operates in.\n\n4. Agritech\n\nAfrica is facing its worst food crisis in 10 years, with 27 million people experiencing extreme hunger in Nigeria, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya; and there are fears that 11 million more could become hungry in 3 months if nothing is done. This food crisis is exacerbated by the high cost of food, recurring droughts, conflicts on the continent, and the Ukraine-Russia war. More than ever Africa needs to be food-sufficient because, for the most part, it has had to rely on humanitarian efforts to feed its citizens. So far, this year, African agritech companies have raised $115 million per TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker.\n\nCompany to watch: ThriveAgric\n\nFounded in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers through financing received from crowdfunders. Then it joined Y Combinator and other notable accelerators, and it looked like it was going to be a happily-ever-after story. But things got bad in 2020 when it couldn\u2019t pay back its crowdfunders; apparently, the pandemic had affected its business model. It survived the turbulence through resilience, a characteristic that is admirable in solving hard problems, especially in Africa, and bounced back when it raised $56.4 million in debt financing to expand to Zambia, Kenya, and Ghana. Since ThriveAgric didn\u2019t go away in 2020, it seems it never will\u2014at least not without putting up a fight.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

Some of them paid for the forms themselves in some cases while various interest groups purchased the nomination tickets for their preferred aspirants.\n\nFormer President Jonathan and the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwumi Adesina, were among those whose forms were bought for them, but the duo have since condemned the move and rejected these forms.\n\nBesides both men, the APC also dropped the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; and Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, from aspirants to be screened by its panel.\n\nThereafter, 23 aspirants appeared before the APC Presidential Screening Committee. In no particular order, they include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, APC chieftain Bola Tinubu, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti; former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole; and oil magnate, Tein Jack Rich.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; popular Pastor Tunde Bakare, former governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yerima; and former governor of Rivers State, Rotimi Amaechi, also appeared before the panel.\n\nAlso screened were former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former presidential candidate, Nicholas Felix; a female aspirant, Uju Ken-Ohanenye; Ondo North Senator, Ajayi Boroffice; and a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani.\n\nOthers include Governor David Umahi Ebonyi; former Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi, and former Minister of Information under the late General Sani Abacha regime, Ikeobasi Mokelu.\n\nAt the end of the primary, the party is expected to produce its candidate who will contest for the office of the President alongside the flagbearers of other political parties in the 2023 general elections.",

It is a continuous process and i believe even at the dying minute we can succeed in doing that. They are all credible aspirants and they are people of honour and we will continue to discuss with them until we succeed.\n\n\u201cZoning is a gentleman\u2019s agreement, and we believe our APC leaders are gentlemen and gentlewomen. That is how we came up with this recommendation, which we conveyed to Mr President, and I am pleased that he has agreed to it\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Governor stated that convincing party members to have power zoned to the South has not been easy but given the facts on the ground, as well as personal experiences, he believes zoning should be respected, and that it should be the turn of the Southern aspirant.\n\nGanduje further added \u201cWe worked extremely hard to save the northern politicians\u2019 niche, particularly those in the APC, as well as to maintain peace and stability. This is a hard fact, But this is not the first time, such thing happened. When the NPN decided to zone the presidency to the Northern part of the country in 1979, a mini convention was held in Kaduna, and I, as a young graduate and politician, took part in the selection of six presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cWe chose six people, including our great president, Shehu Shagari of blessed memory, Maitam Sule of blessed memory, Adamu Ciroma of blessed memory, Takar from Benue, Sola Saraki of blessed memory, and the former vice chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, and presented them to the National Convention in Lagos, where Shagari was elected. You can see that zoning is not a new concept; zoning is a gentleman\u2019s agreement, so there is nothing new to persuade our colleagues to support this resolution. We are pleased that Mr. President has accepted it\u201d.\n\nhttps://www.tvcnews.tv/2022/06/buhari-will-adopt-nobody-but-tinubu-shettima/",

          "text": "When completed, the construction of the 1,028-kilometre Abidjan-Lagos highway would benefit at least 40 million West Africans, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola (SAN), said at the weekend.\n\nThe highway estimated to cost $15.6 billion which is expected to have significant impact on the economies of five regional countries, namely: C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria, he said, remained firmly on course.\n\nSpeaking at the 16th inter-ministerial meeting of the group in Abuja, Fashola who doubles as the Chairman of the five regional ministerial steering committee, noted that the resources were being mobilised to ensure the Nigerian axis of the project was completed soon.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria section is the famous Lagos-Badagry corridor. As the designs are going on, integration is going on and our government led by President Muhammadu Buhari through his tax-credit scheme, has mobilised the resources that will ensure that the Lagos-badagry section of this highway can be fully paid for.\n\n\u201cMoney is now in place and work is now going on and those who are familiar with the corridor must have realised that between December last year and the first quarter of this year, there has been more rapid deployment of men, machines and materials along that corridor,\u201d he assured.\n\nFashola further revealed that the link bridge between Nigeria and Cameroon, which was largely funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB) would be commissioned this month.\n\n\u201cWe have completed a new link bridge that links Nigeria to Cameroon, and it was funded largely by the AfDB and we are hoping that the ECOWAS commission will give us the necessary support to ensure the formal opening of that bridge sometime in the month of June,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the minister, the commitment to the piece of infrastructure is to upgrade the road network into a first class six lane highway, stressing that although there was need for speed, quality must not be sacrificed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to deliver a better life for five countries and over 40 million people who use that corridor, almost on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cThe future is bright, this is an important investment for the people of Africa to achieve the objective of the Africa Union (AU) to create a trans-African highway,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso speaking, the Chief Transport Economist, AfDB and Task Manager for the project, Lydie Ehouman, said the bank had been able to secure an agreement for an additional \u20ac3.5 million for the road project.\n\nEhouman added that with the addition, it brings the total amount available for the initial financing of the strategic study on the project to $ 41 million.\n\n\u201cThe agreement for the on-lending of this additional grant by the bank to ECOWAS is currently being finalised. Thus, in addition to its substantial contribution of $25 million, the bank will have mobilised \u20ac12.63 million in the form of a grant from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThis brings the total amount available for the financing of this highly strategic study to the equivalent of about US$ 41 million,\u201d the AfDB top employee stated.\n\nHowever, she noted that the claim of delay by consultants in member countries were not tenable, since the agreement was that work should continue while any variation could be discussed and resolved.\n\nIn his remarks, Ghana\u2019s Minister of Roads and Highways, Kwasi Amoako-Attah urged the government of the five countries to do everything possible to help remove whatever impediment that may be slowing down the project.\n\nHe called on member states to speed up the negotiation with the consultants to reach amicable settlement, explaining that West Africa cannot afford to lose any more time.\n\n\u201cI would also want to call on my colleague ministers again to humbly consider a fair compensation, so as to enable the consultants to undertake that assignment within our revised timelines,\u201d he added.\n\nThe ECOWAS Commissioner for Infrastructure, Mr. Pathe Gueye, in his remarks, said technical studies had been extended from June 2021 to December 2022, as a result of the setback occasioned by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAppropriate measures relating to this resumption should also be taken, in particular, the extension of the deadlines of the contracts that have expired,\u201d he noted.",
