          "title": "Domestic flights delay, cancellation will continue, operators tell Senate",
          "text": "The operators of airlines in Nigeria have justified the delay and cancellations of domestic flights in the country.\n\nThe operators hinged the reason on non-availability and rising cost of aviation fuel, also known as JetA1 and inadequate parking spaces at airports.\n\nThe operators, led by the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, stated this on Tuesday when they appeared before the Senate Committee on Aviation chaired by Senator Smart Adeyemi.\n\nHe also demanded the prosecution of unruly passengers at the Airports.\n\nOnyema claimed that on several occasions, JetA1 has been very scarce nationwide and has been affecting airline operations around the country.\n\nHe added that at times the operators go the extra mile to fulfil their obligation to customers by looking for fuel at the black market.\n\nHe said, \u201cApart from the fact that the shortage of Jet A-1 is crippling our operations, the marketers have been increasing the price of the product consistently in the recent past to an unbearable point.\n\n\u201cAs of April this year, Jet A-1 fuel was being sold for about N230 a litre.\n\n\u201cAbout a month ago in May, the price jumped to between N250- N255.\n\n\u201cAs of today, the price has skyrocketed to an average of N280- N300 a litre depending on if you are buying in Lagos or Abuja. This has greatly increased our operational cost.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of Peace Airline also hinged the cancellation and delay of flights on inadequate parking spaces for aircraft.\n\nHe explained that during the rush hour between 6.39am \u2013 8.30, there are usually between 14-15 aircraft departures out of the local airport in Lagos.\n\nUnfortunately, he said, the Apron at Muritala Muhammed Airport, Ikeja, Lagos could only accommodate a maximum of six aircraft at a time while the newly built apron can accommodate another three or four aircraft. This means jostle for parking space which also causes delay.\n\nOther reasons cited by Onyema were non-availability of forex for spare parts and maintenance, sudden change of weather, delay due to VIP movement, inefficient passenger access and facilitation, delay clearance of spare parts from Customs and inadequate screening and exit points at departure.\n\nOn the unruly behaviour of some passengers, Onyema called for the prosecution of some passengers who behave unruly at the airport.\n\nHe lamented that some passengers usually assault airline staff for no just reason while some of their computers have been destroyed by these passengers.\n\nBut, the members of the Committee kicked against the reasons presented by the Airline Operators of Nigeria.\n\nThey said something must be done by the operators to address the causes of delays and cancellations in domestic Airline Operations.\n\nSpecifically, Senator Abba Moro said that the excuses by the operators were not the tradition in other countries across the world.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee Smart Adeyemi said that the purpose of the meeting was to address the issue of causes of delay and cancellations of domestic flights.\n\nHe also said the panel was concerned about the state of the airport across the country and safety measures put in place.",

          "text": "By Joseph Erunke\n\nYOUTHS in the Niger Delta region have rejected the provision of three per cent equity shareholding in the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB to host communities.\n\nOperating under the aegis of Niger Delta Youth Council, NDYC, they insisted that the ceding of only three per cent equity shareholding to the oil and gas producing communities was unacceptable.\n\nTo this end, they urged all stakeholders in the region to rise up and insist that the 10 per cent demand be implemented.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Nigerian Senate recently passed the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, after the House of Representatives did the same. In the Bill, three per cent profit from oil companies is ceded to host communities\n\nBut the NDYC in a statement jointly signed by its national coordinator, Engr Jator Abido, and the director for international affairs, Comr Collins Ufuoma Achakpekri explained that while the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill was a welcome development, the allocation of only three per cent profit from oil companies to host communities was grossly inadequate and needed to be reviewed upwardly.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta Youth Council rejects the three per cent to host communities and 30 per cent 30 percent of the profit generated by the proposed Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited to the exploration of oil in \u2018frontier basins\u2019 as stipulated in the PIB. We demand for 10 per cent as host communities and five for impact community.\n\n\u201cThe three per cent allocated to host communities is grossly inadequate. Prior to the passage, many stakeholders appealed to the National Assembly to allocate five per cent profit to the host communities.\n\n\u201cThe earlier five per cent canvassed for was rejected to be poor. Cutting it down to three per cent is unimaginable and unacceptable. Communities, who own these resources and suffer the devastation of oil exploration and exploitation, deserve a better deal than three per cent.\n\n\u201cIt is our firm belief that the members of the National Assembly got it wrong at a point but would revisit the issue and make necessary adjustments. Should the National Assembly fails to do the needful, we call on President Muhammadu Buhari who has proven to be passionate about the Niger Delta issues to insist that the three per cent is reviewed to 10 percent before signing the Bill into law,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nIt further averred that the three per cent as proposed is unfair to the region considering the fact that host committees are suffering from environmental degradation, air pollution, and other epidemic being caused by the oil exploration from the communities.\n\nThe statement also urged the Federal Government round off the forensic audit being carried out in NDDC so as to inaugurate the already screened board.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

I just defended his right to freedom of expression and association.\n\n\u201cHowever, a former Presidential candidate on Tuesday sent me a tape of Nnamdi Kanu dissolving the UK branch of IPOB and tongue lashing the members.\n\n\u201cI was shocked and refused to believe what I heard until I was directed to an IPOB channel where this same audio was broadcast.\n\n\u201cAfter I published the video on my page the most shocking thing happened. Various persons who claimed to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra descended on my page and insulted me, attacked me and accused me of collecting money from Buhari.\n\n\u201cThey even said Nnamdi Kanu can insult anyone he liked and I should leave him alone and so I went into deep thought.\n\n\u201cIf Kanu eventually gets Biafra and I am a minority in that Biafra, what would be my fate?\n\n\u201cI am not Yoruba, but because of me, these IPOB members insulted the Yoruba clan. Somebody even threatened to kill me if I ever stepped into Onitsha.\n\n\u201cMy experience with Mr. Kanu\u2019s supporters made me have a rethink.\n\n\u201cLooking back to those broadcasts, it has become obvious to me that Kanu himself made IPOB (not the Igbos as Buhari claims) a dot in a circle.\n\n\u201cWho would want to be a minority in a country ruled by Kanu?

          "title": "BREAKING: Court asked to set aside nomination of Soludo as Anambra APGA candidate",
          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe controversy trailing the nomination of a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof Charles Soludo, as the flag bearer of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, has resulted into a lawsuit filed before the Abuja division of the Federal High Court.\n\nIn the originating summons, a chieftain of the party, Okoye Nwabuogo, is seeking an order of court setting aside the election and nomination of Soludo as the party\u2019s candidate for the November election.\n\nThe suit dated July 6, 2021, and filed the same day by counsel to the plaintiff, Okoro Nkemakolam, is further seeking an order restraining Soludu from parading himself as the validly or duly elected candidate of the party for the said election.\n\nIt is the case of the plaintiff, who is a card-carrying member of the party and a registered voter, that the statutory 21 days notice was not given to INEC by the party, prior to the holding of the special ward congress, held on June 15, 2021, for the election of ad hoc delegates for the nomination of the party\u2019s governorship candidate for the Anambra State gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021.\n\nListed as defendants in the pre-election suit are All Progressive Grand Alliance, Prof Charles Soludo and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nWhile urging the court to invalidate and set aside the entire primary election of the party held on June 23, the plaintiff is equally seeking an order of injunction restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC, listed as 3rd defendant), from accepting the name of or recognising Prof Soludo (the 2nd Defendant), as the candidate of APGA (the 1st defendant), for the Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6, 2021.\n\nShe is also seeking an order of the court restraining the party from holding out or in any manner howsoever and/or according to Soludo the rights or privileges as its validly or duly elected candidate for the November 6, 2021 governorship election in the state.\n\nIn addition, she is further seeking a declaration that the party, is mandatorily required, given the provision of Section 85(1) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) to give to the 3rd defendant (INEC), the compulsory 21days statutory notice prior to the holding of the special ward congress, held on June 15, 2021, for the election of ad hoc delegates for the nomination of its governorship candidate for the Anambra State gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on November 6.\n\nA declaration that the election of 812 delegates as against the 978 delegates, as provided for in Article 11(5)(vii) of the APGA Constitution 2019, to be ad hoc delegates, to elect the governorship candidate of the party, is illegal, unlawful, invalid, null and void.\n\nShe formulated the following questions for determination by the court:\n\n\u2018Whether given the clear and unambiguous provisions of Section 85(1) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended), the 3rd Defendant can, in the light of its two separate letters dated 18th June 2021 with REF: INEC/DEPM/UPMM/1/145 and REF: INEC/DEPM/CWO/040/11/304 which disclosed that APGA (1st Defendant), failed to give it, the mandatory 21days statutory notice, prior to the holding of the special ward congress, on 15th day of June 2021, for the election of ad hoc delegates for the nomination of the 1st Defendant\u2019s governorship candidate for the Anambra State gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021, lawfully recognise, deal with and give effect to the nomination of the 2nd Defendant through the primary election of the 1st defendant held on 23rd June 2021 as the 1st Defendant\u2019s candidate for the said governorship election. Whether given the clear provisions of Article 11(5)(vii) of the APGA Constitution 2019, which provides for the election of three delegates per ward, to be ad hoc delegates, to elect the governorship candidate of the party, the party can lawfully proceed to elect only two delegates in violation of it constitution. Whether the primary election of the 1st Defendant held on 23rd June 2021 for the purpose of electing the 1st Defendant\u2019s candidate for Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021 is not invalidated by reason of the 1st Defendant\u2019s non-compliance with the mandatory provision of Section 85(1) of the Electoral Act, 2010(as amended), and Article (5)(vii) of the APGA Constitution, 2019.\u2019\n\nIn a 31-paragraphs affidavit in support of the originating summons, the plaintiff averred:\n\n\u2018That in the said letters the 3rd Defendant expressly stated that the 1st defendant failed to give the mandatory/compulsory 21days statutory notice prior to the holding of the special ward congress held on 15th day of June 2021, for the election of ad hoc delegates for the nomination of the 1st Defendant\u2019s governorship candidate for the Anambra State gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021 and as such the 3rd Defendant did not monitor the said ward congresses and cannot attest if the purported ad hoc Delegates are products of a democratic process. \u2018That she knows as a matter of fact that notwithstanding the failure to communicate to the 3rd Defendant within the mandatory 21 days, the date for the conduct of the special ward congress, the 1st Defendant held its primary election on 23rd June 2021 utilising an ad hoc Delegate list of the purported special Ward Congress wherein the 2nd Defendant purportedly emerged as the flagbearer and forwarded the name of the 2nd Defendant who was enthroned in the said congresses to the 3rd Defendant. \u2018That the 3rd Defendant as an umpire rather than intervene to stop the 1st Defendant from further perpetuating illegality in the light of the two separate letters dated 18th June 2021 with REF: INEC/DEPM/UPMM/1/145 and REF: INEC/DEPM/CWO/040/11/304, proceeded to issue a certificate of return to the 2nd Defendant, thereby lawfully accepting, dealing with and recognising the 2nd defendant as the validly nominated candidate of the 1st defendant for the Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021. \u2018That she knows as a matter of fact that the primary election of the 1st Defendant, was not conducted in accordance with the law, and will likely prejudice the chances of her party winning the gubernatorial election, except this Honourable Court intervenes as a matter of urgency. \u2018The plaintiff stated that the 1st Defendant failed to comply with the provisions of its constitution in the conduct of the special congress held on the 15th day of June 2021 to elect ad hoc delegates for the purposes of electing the candidate/flagbearer of the 1st defendant in the Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6, 2021. \u2018That there are 326 wards in Anambra State and that as a matter of fact, there ought to be three delegates from each ward, bringing the total number of delegates 978, which is not inclusive of statutory delegates. \u2018That she knows as a matter of fact that the list submitted by the 1st Defendant to the 3rd Defendant has only 812 names as against the 978 delegates. \u2018That she knows as a matter of fact, that by the constitution of the APGA, three persons were to be elected in the said special congress and not two persons as was done by the 1st Defendant in the said special congress, held on the 15th day of June 2021. \u2018That the 3rd Defendant will continue to recognise, deal with and give effect to the nomination of the 2nd Defendant through the primary election of the 1st defendant held on 23rd June 2021 as the 1st Defendant\u2019s candidate for the said governorship election unless restrained by the Court. \u2018That the 2nd Defendant will continue to hold himself with rights or privileges as the validly or duly elected candidate of the 1st defendant for the Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6, 2021, having been recognised by the 3rd Defendant unless restrained by the court. \u2018That her interest as a member of the 1st Defendant will be highly prejudiced except by the urgent intervention of this Honourable Court. \u2018That she had invested her resources and goodwill in the 1st Defendant, and knows as a matter of fact, that except by the urgent intervention of this Honourable Court, the goodwill of the party will be totally destroyed and her goodwill and resources lost.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the suit is yet to be assigned to a judge for adjudication.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Prior to being president, he was a banana farmer.\n\nThe former president had dealt with unrest in his country following conflict involving the end of his presidency. According to the BBC, Haiti\u2019s oppositional party said Moise\u2019s five-year presidency should have ended on Feb. 7, 2021, but he argued he had one more year to serve since he did not take the office until Feb. 7, 2017.\n\nMoise faced numerous accusations of corruption since he had been ruling by decree after his administration did not hold elections in October 2019. Tensions rose so high that the president arrested 23 people, including a top judge and a police officer, for an alleged coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\nBefore his assassination, Moise said he was going to arrange for local, municipal, legislative, and presidential elections to be held in 2021.\n\nBBC\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Lawmakers from south back govs\n\n*ACF: We can\u2019t dictate to parties\n\n*Northern elders rebuff zoning\n\nAdedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja, John Shiklam in Kaduna, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nThe quest for southern presidency in 2023 gathered momentum yesterday as Benue State Governor, Mr. Samuel Ortom, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF); and the members of the House of Representatives from the 17 Southern states backed the demand by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum for the next president to come from the region.\n\nThe lawmakers also backed the governors\u2019 rejection of certain provisions of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) passed by the National Assembly.\n\nHowever, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has urged advocates of power rotation to exercise their discretion on which zone produces the next president, in line with the 1999 Constitution that reserves the right to sponsor candidates to contest elections for political parties only.\n\nSpeaking yesterday to THISDAY in Jos, Plateau State capital, President of the Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said: \u201cWe agree with them (Southern governors) fully that the president should come from the South. Given the kind of situation we find ourselves in this country, it is only good to allow fairness and equity in this nation.\n\n\u201cBy 2023, the North would have finished serving for eight years. So, it should go to the South. It is not for us to tell the South which side it should go in the South; they can decide to give it to the South-east, South-south, or South-west. But it should go to the South. We know that they are also rational in their consideration; so they should be able to determine among themselves, which side it should go in the South.\u201d\n\nPogu added that going by the exigencies of time, it would only be right to zone the presidency to the South, adding that the moment calls for seriousness in terms of equity.\n\nOrtom commended his colleagues for their position on power rotation, saying only equity, fairness and justice could strengthen the unity of Nigeria, give all citizens a sense of belonging and reduce tensions in the country.\n\nHis Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, quoted him as describing the decision of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum to enact laws to ban open grazing of livestock in the region as a bold and patriotic move that will end the lingering crisis caused by armed herdsmen.\n\nOrtom lauded his colleagues for backing their May 11, 2011 Asaba Declaration against open grazing with the resolve to legally prohibit nomadic cattle rearing\n\nHe said the resolution conformed to the global best practice of animal husbandry.\n\nOrtom re-echoed his call on the federal government to respect the 1999 Constitution as altered on fundamental human rights, the rule of law and federal character.\n\nHe restated his commitment to speak out against injustice, quoting Reverend Martin Luther King Jnr., who stated: \u201cOur lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\u201d\n\nSpokesman of ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, told THISDAY that the 1999 Constitution gives only the political parties the right to sponsor candidates to contest elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ACF is a socio-cultural group and not a political party, therefore, it will be against the spirit and letter of the constitution if we start dictating to the parties which part of the country a presidential candidate should come from.\n\n\u201cHowever, when the parties hold their primaries and candidates emerge, we would interact with them and find out their idea about the North. In that way, we can help the Northern voters to make their choices,\u201d Yawe stated.\n\nAlso, the members of the House of Representatives from the 17 Southern states endorsed the resolution of their governors on power rotation.\n\nThey also described the attempt to tamper with the 2010 Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 by removing the clause on electronic transmission of results as a malicious and unpatriotic act to emasculate the electoral system, undermine democracy and destabilise the country.\n\nThe Chairman of the House of Representatives Southern Caucus, Hon. Victor Nwokolo, in a statement yesterday, said the alleged attempt to remove electronic transmission of results clause from the bill could not be condoned or justified under any guise whatsoever.\n\nThe lawmakers said the resolution by their governors reinforced their stance that the nation must and should exist on the pillars of justice, equity, fairness, peaceful co-existence and mutual respect, particularly in the political, economic and structural management of its national diversity.\n\nAccording to them, the demand that the next president should come from the South represents the opinion of the majority of Nigerians across the board, and is in tandem with the already established rotation of presidency position between the South and the North.\n\nThey stated: \u201cFurthermore, against the backdrop of our commitment towards free, fair, credible and transparent elections, the members of the House of Representatives from the South also backs our governors in rejecting the moves to outlaw the electronic transmission of election result in the Electoral Act, as well as the confirmation of exclusive jurisdiction in pre-election matters on the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cThe attempt to tamper with the Electoral Act to remove electronic transmission of result is, therefore, a malicious and unpatriotic act aimed to emasculate our electoral system, undermine our democracy and destabilise our dear country, and such cannot be condoned or justified under any guise whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers described the electronic transmission of results directly from the polling unit as a firm step towards the elimination of result-collation-related malpractices, including alteration of figures, mutilation of documents, snatching and diversion of ballot materials on transit to collation centres, among others.\n\nOn the PIB, the lawmakers affirmed the governors\u2019 rejection of the proposed 30 per cent share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins.\n\nThey also rejected the moves to vest the ownership structure of Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) in the Ministry of Finance and backed the governors in their resolve that such should be held in trust by Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) since all tiers of government have stakes in that agency.\n\nThey added: \u201cAs lawmakers, we insist that the 30 per cent share of profit as well as vesting ownership structure of the proposed NNPC on the ministry of finance instead of the NSIA do not reflect the desired essentials of justice, equity and fairness.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers, however, supported the five per cent share of the oil revenue to the host community as recommended by the House, while assuring their constituents that every effort would be made to sustain their position at the harmonisation level.\n\nOn security, they reiterated their support for the establishment of state police and ban on open grazing by Southern states, adding that governors, as chief security officers in the states, must be duly informed before the execution of any security operation in their states.\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has rejected the position of the Southern governors that the 2023 presidency should be zoned to the Southern part of the country.\n\nThe forum\u2019s position was made in a statement issued yesterday by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.\n\nNEF said as far as the North was concerned, the idea that it would be threatened, intimidated or blackmailed into yielding an office which ought to be settled democratically is not acceptable.\n\n\u201cWe are running a democratic government and decisions over where the next president comes from are basically decisions that will be made by voters exercising their rights to choose which candidate best serves their interest,\u201d it said.\n\nThe forum explained that the southern governors come from the two dominant parties: APC and PDP, saying that they must have some influence in those parties.\n\nNEF urged the southern governors to influence their parties to zone the presidency to southern states and then work to convince Nigerian voters from all parts of the country to vote for that candidate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon; former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo; former Head of Interim National Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan; and former President Goodluck Jonathan have condoled with the Aig-Imoukhuede family over the death of their matriarch, Pastor Emily Aig-Imoukhuede.\n\nEmily Imoukhude, former Secretary of State (Minister) for States and Local Government Affairs died on June 8, 2021.\n\nA condolence letter jointly signed by General Yakubu Gowon and his wife, Victoria, urged the family to stay strong and be comforted knowing that she had played well her part and the family also played the roles expected of them to ensure everyday of her life was very well spent.\n\nGowon\u2019s letter read: \u201cAt a time like this, it\u2019s difficult to find the right words to express the depth of the loss of such a fine-spirited woman leader who made sincere and wholesome contribution to nation-building as a former National President of the National Council for Women Societies, NCWS (1988-1993). Her voice on behalf of Nigerian women was strident and hard to ignore. Her appointment as honorable Secretary of State (junior Minister) for States and Local Government Affairs in the Federal Executive Council in 1993 affirmed that women are no pushovers.\n\n\u201cAs a mother, she raised phenominally successful children, Erekpitan, Aigboje, Kemi and Aigbovbioise who have also made indelible marks in their personal and professional callings.\u201d\n\nThe former head of state and his wife also said, \u201cAs an ordained pastor, she worked tirelessly to win souls for God\u2019s Kingdom,\u201d adding, \u201cwe are confident that her good works will remain an everlasting legacy of her time here on earth.\u201d\n\nFormer President Obasanjo, in his condolence letter addressed to her son, Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, described the late Emily Imoukhuede as an \u201dillustrious daughter of Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we mourn the passing of this illustrious daughter of Africa, we must resolve that her great labour of love shall not be in vain,\u201d the former president said.\n\nNoting that the late Emily Aig-Imoukhuede served the nation loyally and with distinction, the former President said her enormous contributions to the nation in particular earned her an eminent position in the nation\u2019s gallery of unforgettable public servants.\n\nObasanjo\u2019s condolence letter read: \u201cIt is with a deep sense of loss that I wish, on behlf of my family and on my behalf, to commiserate with you and the entire members of the Aig-Imoukhuede family on the passing of your dear matriarch, Pastor Emily Okheren Aig-Imiukhuede, on June 8, 2021\n\n\u201cOn occasions like this , it is indeed difficult to find the appropriate words to soothe the anguish of the irreparable loss. She was arguably a great lady who was to her children a mother in a million and one who served variously as a public servant, women\u2019s champion, teacher, confidant, counselor and pillar of strength to you all through her lifetime. Her enormous contributions to the nation in particular earned her an eminent position in the nation\u2019s gallery of unforgettable public servants.\n\n\u201cShe served her country committedly, loyally and with distinction, notably as the Honourable Secretary of State (minister) for States and Local Government in 1993, among others. Indeed she left her mark indelibly in whatever she was called upon to do. Indeed, she was a dutiful and hardworking fellow and gave her very best to the end in the service of her fatherland. In all the assignment she was called upon to do. She was a dutiful and hardworking fellow and gave her very best to the end in the service of her fatherland.\n\n\u201cIn all the assignments she was given, quality and integrity were her imprint and legacy, while she left an indelible mark in her national assignments at the federal level and various facets of the private sector. Her life was, indeed, a clear testimony of divine favour as well as the power of a devoted, loving upbringing on the fortunes of her children. There is no doubt that her memory will remain evergreen well beyond the family. But we must encourage you to accept the inevitable with faith in God\u2019s unfailing love according to His will and purpose.\u201d\n\nChief Ernest Shonekan, in whose government she served as secretary of state for States and Local Government Affairs, described her as \u201can elegant, very kind and good woman.\u201d\n\nHis letter read: \u201cIt is with a very deep sense of loss, yet, with gratitude to God for a life well spent, and also an immense honour for me to be afforded the opportunity on behalf of my wife and children, to pen a tribute to a recently departed, most treasured friend, wife, mother and grandmother.\n\n\u201cEmily and my wife, Margaret began their lifelong friendship as contemporaries at the University College lbadan, in 1951. They both distinguished themselves in their subsequent careers, with Emily as the Curator of the National Museum, and Margaret at the West African Examinations Council. Through them, our children became and have remained friends. Subsequently, they both were appointed as Trustees of the Chrisland University, Abeokuta.\n\n\u201cI remember with fondness and gratitude a beaded walking stick she gave me on my fiftieth birthday, when she also divulged to me that I share the same birthday as one of her sons. lt was such a beautiful work of art, which I have kept to this day. ln 1993, I was privileged to work with her directly when she served in the lnterim government which I led, as the Secretary of State for States and Local Governments.\n\n\u201cEmily always had a smile for everyone. She would have built just as distinguished a career as a diplomat. She was a friend to amazingly diverse people, a devoted family woman, and a most decent human being. Almost all who had the privilege of meeting her in life will acknowledge her extreme kindness, generosity and a very large heart. I have met very few people in my own life, who have matched her capacity to go out of her way to be of assistance wherever she could, even to complete strangers. lt would have come as no surprise to those who knew her well, of her later calling in life to evangelism and expansion of the kingdom of God.\u201d\n\nAlso condoling with the Imoukhuede family, former President Jonathan in his condolence letter addressed to Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, described her as \u201can accomplished public servant and philanthropist.\u201d\n\nJonathan said her legacies and contributions to national development, especially in the health, education and energy sectors, would continue to endure.\n\nFormer President Jonathan\u2019s letter read: \u201cI learned with deep compassion, the news of the passing on of your dear mother, Mrs. Emily Oheren Aig-Imoukhuede, to eternal glory.\n\n\u201cYour mother was very special to you and your family for which her death would have left a deep void in your heart and in the hearts of all those she dearly loved.\n\n\u201cPlease be comforted by the fact that Mrs. Aig-Imoukhuede was an accomplished public servant and philanthropist whose legacies and contributions to national development, especially in the health, education and energy sectors, will continue to endure.\n\n\u201cShe will also be remembered as an exemplary matriarch and epitome of motherhood, having nurtured and brought up distinguished Nigerians and successful netrepreneurs like you and your siblings.\u201d\n\nThe former President prayed God to grant her soul eternal repose and the family the fortitude to bear her absence.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "From iPhone shortages to price surges: The global chip scarcity is affecting Africa",
          "text": "Car manufacturers in Egypt have had to cut down on production due to a recent lack of electronic control units (ECUs), which are major components in vehicle electrical systems. In South Africa, more than 20,000 people that signed up for Supersonic\u2019s Unlimited Air Fibre service are still waiting to be connected since February, as the company continues to face difficulties getting crucial router components.\n\nThe aforementioned companies operate in two distinct industries (automobile and ICT) and \u2013 apart from the consumers they sell to \u2013 do not really have much in common. But like many others in several industries across the world, they have seen their businesses disrupted by the same problem.\n\nTechnology companies globally have recently been grappling with the shortage of one of the smallest components used in producing millions of tech products yearly \u2013 semiconductor chips.\n\nMonths into the shortage, effects from the ongoing global chip scarcity have spread far and wide, across industries and the globe. Automotive and consumer hardware companies are being hit the worst and those in Africa have not been spared.\n\nDistributors of Acer products in South Africa \u2013 Mustek, Rectron, and Homemation \u2013 told ITWeb that the severe shortage has caused a ripple effect across all industry verticals, leading to a shortage of laptops, tablets, printing and scanning equipment, and peripherals.\n\nThe automobile industry is one of the hardest hit by the semiconductor shortage with carmakers across the world forced to slash production.\n\nPrice jumps as over 100 industries suffer\n\nAn analysis by U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs, estimates that the semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way. This is due to the fact that chips are more widely used today. They used to be present in only personal computers and mobile phones a little over a decade ago. Now, in the wake of rapid digital advancements, semiconductors are in everything from vehicles to washing machines.\n\nManufacturers have struggled to keep up with the huge demand in recent months, a problem blamed partly on supply chain disruptions caused by national Covid-19 lockdowns, uncertainties stemming from the U.S.-China trade war, as well as a drought in Taiwan, home to the largest semiconductor maker in the world.\n\nIn fact, Taiwan is one of the four countries in Asia behind nearly three-quarters of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Of these countries, only two produce the most cutting-edge chips.\n\nThe Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone provides 92% of cutting-edge chips globally \u2013 with Samsung accounting for the rest \u2013 and 60% of chips used by automobile companies. This leaves companies with few options to get chips when the producers run out of capacity and also raises concerns about the concentration of chip manufacturing in relatively few countries.\n\nThe global semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nU.S. tech giant Apple has been significantly affected as it is one of TSMC\u2019s biggest clients. In South Africa, many stores run by the company\u2019s authorised reseller, iStore, have reportedly experienced shortages in iPhone stock. Meanwhile, TechCabal was unable to reach the Nigerian unit of iStore for comments as of the time this article was published.\n\nGoing by the law of demand and supply in economics, there is bound to be an increase in the price of a product when there\u2019s a scarcity, as long as all things remain equal. So the global chip shortage has naturally led to price increases and there\u2019s not so much local players can do about it.\n\n\u201cThese are not components domestic car makers can produce,\u201d head of the Egyptian Association of Automobile Manufacturers, Khaled Saad, reportedly told local press. \u201cThe problem is already putting pressure on car prices domestically and it is expected to raise prices further.\u201d\n\nReports show many local stores in South Africa are now selling well above the retail prices suggested by manufacturers.\n\nAccording to David Kan, CEO of Mustek, the ongoing shortage is the worst in more than three decades. \u201cIn my 34 years of working within the IT industry, I have never experienced or seen such shortages. Pricing has gone through the roof!\u201d\n\nAny end in sight?\n\nThe multifaceted global chip shortage problem is showing no signs of abating.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, there were hopes that the supply chain issues would have been sorted by the summer. However, it is unlikely that will be the case, even though the summer does not end until September.\n\nIndustry analysts also can\u2019t seem to agree on when the shortage will end, with predictions ranging from the second half of 2021 to the beginning of 2022. Some experts say the effects of the crisis could last well into 2023. However, the general consensus seems to be that things will get even worse before it gets better as there is no immediate solution.\n\nSome global chipmakers \u2013 such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel \u2013 are already investing to expand their capacity and ramp up production. The U.S. is also working towards investing billions in its semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIn Africa, Kenya\u2019s Dedan Kimathi University of Technology partnered with American firm 4Wave Inc on the launch of the country\u2019s first semiconductor factory earlier this year.\n\nA future partnership between local car agents and brand owners to set up local facilities for manufacturing high-tech components like semiconductors is also being mooted among automobile stakeholders in Egypt.\n\nBut these moves can do little to ease off the crisis immediately as it will take months, if not several years, for the investments to mature.\n\nFor now, tech products are bound to keep fighting for limited chips, manufacturers grappling with delayed production, and consumers suffering from shortages and price increases.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "What telcos and banks look for in fintech partnerships",
          "text": "Fintech is growing in Africa thanks to strategic partnerships between startups, banks and diverse categories of global companies. According to McKinsey & Company, at least five models of partnerships are currently favoured.\n\nOne model is a vendor relationship: a bank that needs to quickly go to market with an innovation opts to ride on a fintech\u2019s technology, avoiding the hassle of building from scratch.\n\nIn a distribution model, a digital-only bank (say Kuda) partners with traditional banks to offer in-branch deposits, ATM withdrawals and card issuance. Chaka, the recently licensed stock trading app, has been able to provide investment options to users by working with brokerage partners.\n\nOther partnership models from McKinsey\u2019s research include strategic Investments (like Visa\u2019s 20% stake in Interswitch); joint ventures (where two entities create a common product together); and outright acquisitions \u2013 the popular example over the past year being Paystack\u2019s acquisition by Stripe.\n\nWhatever the partnership type, the aim is to win. For a startup, a long term win might be a successful exit or Initial Public Offering (IPO). Otherwise, the immediate goal is to accelerate growth at a rate they wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve if they worked alone.\n\nBut partnerships don\u2019t automatically work just because two parties have good intentions or similar ambitions.\n\nNot a piece of cake\n\n\u201cSuccess should not be taken for granted and both parties need to be well prepared,\u201d says Mayowa Kuyoro, partner at McKinsey and head of its West Africa financial services practice.\n\nAlignment on resources, culture and regulatory compliance, among other factors, is key.\n\nIt\u2019s a consideration that is always on Abubakar Suleiman\u2019s mind. As CEO of Sterling Bank, Suleiman receives partnership offers regularly and believes himself open to having many conversations.\n\nBut he has identified a problem: \u201cMore often than not, we are not clear about the problem we are trying to solve,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cWe are trying to jump into partnerships because we think there is profit to be shared.\u201d\n\nPartnership conversations have worked better for Suleiman when the initial focus was on problems and the capacity to solve them. And so he wishes to encourage an approach that frames partnerships in terms of capabilities, not institutions.\n\nFor example, a startup that needs a partner for regulatory issues should go for the most capable and experienced firm on the subject. It should not matter whether this firm is a big bank or whatever else.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the table?\n\nThat said, the size of rewards at stake for both parties matters.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make sure the economics work out for everybody,\u201d says Tayo Oviosu, co-founder and CEO of Paga.\n\nHe cites the example of Paga\u2019s partnership with Interswitch in the 2010s which, though initially successful in terms of returns to both parties, tapered off for a while. It raised a need for a review after which Paga decided it was in its best interest to plug directly into every other billing services provider in Nigeria.\n\nRia, the money transfer service provider, operates in 43 African countries. According to Robert Kotei, operations director for Africa, startups and companies present beyond one country can be more appealing to multinational companies looking for partnerships.\n\nHowever, sometimes a startup may need to patiently prove itself before landing big partnerships.\n\nWhile getting Bankly off the ground in 2019, Tomilola Majekodunmi faced the dilemma of deciding what partners she needed for the startup\u2019s ambition to digitalise contributory savings networks known as ajo. To achieve this, Bankly planned to work with telcos.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out, partly because the potential partners were already looking to directly offer services similar to what Bankly proposed. They did not see a unique advantage to entice them towards a partnership.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a fair or just partnership either because we were too young or too small for these big players,\u201d Majekodunmi said. So Bankly spent two years building an agent network which now numbers 15,000 agents across Nigeria.\n\nMinimum viable partnerships\n\nElsa Muzzolini, a general manager for MTN\u2019s mobile financial services, acknowledges the difficulty in partnering with relatively small startups. Three factors, she said, are often at play.\n\nParties may have different expectations for how long deals take to complete. They may diverge on the initially agreed scope, and finding the precise contact person who can activate decisions can be hard.\n\nWhere these factors come together, partnerships can work. But Muzzolini would like startups to seek avenues for collaboration that bypass the formal phases that a typical partnership entails.\n\n\u201cCan we do a lighter form of partnership? Get my API, run with it. Maybe at a later stage as your numbers grow, we can discuss co-branding and other things.\u201d\n\nFollow all TechCabal Live conversations on our YouTube channel.

          "title": "Tolu Michaels on how digital entrepreneurs create and sell intangible products online",
          "text": "In 2021, when you think of how best to serve people beyond physical borders, the internet comes to mind.\n\nBuilding a business on the internet could play out in two different ways. Your business can either deal with offering physical products for sale online or providing a service online. The former would be tangible while the latter would have no physical form whatsoever.\n\nTolu Michael chose to provide a service \u2013 a digital product \u2013 where she guides people on how to establish personal reputation using the internet. She\u2019s helping them gain visibility online. I had an interesting chat with her on what it\u2019s like creating services and selling to tens of thousands of people online from the comfort of her home in Lagos, Nigeria. But before we dive in, let\u2019s take a stroll through her career journey.\n\nA digital entrepreneur with an engineering background\n\nAfter studying mechanical engineering in Nigeria- something she did because of her love for cars \u2013 she took a detour into the world of investment banking. This happened after she interned at a Toyota after-sales franchise for a while and realised she didn\u2019t want to deal with the smell of petrol and engine oil every day.\n\nSomewhere in her career journey, marriage happened and she had to move cities but during that process, she lost her job so she had to rethink her career path. As a woman, changing jobs alongside starting a new family came with startling challenges.\n\nMichaels\u2019 initial obstacle being a newly wedded woman is not exactly a peculiar one. In a lot of family situations, prioritizing family over work is the number one barrier to a woman\u2019s career. This study by Harvard Business School says more than half of Gen X and Baby Boomer men expected that their careers would take priority over their partners. In the study, \u201c73 percent of men and 85 percent of women agreed that prioritizing family over work is the most difficult career decision women face.\n\nFor Michaels, being newly married came with lots of \u201cspecific rejections,\u201d where employers assume she might get carried away with building a family and leave her job to suffer. At this point, searching for new job opportunities proved abortive so she figured she could try out something on her own and that just happened to be digital entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cInitially, I started to ask myself, what do I have to offer people, especially beyond borders, because I couldn\u2019t do something physical. I didn\u2019t have the capital to sell physical products so I needed something I could provide people in whatever location I am,\u201d she tells me on our Google Meet call.\n\nLeveraging knowledge commerce\n\nDigital products are basically online products that can\u2019t be held, touched, or tasted. They could be music, videos, ebooks, online courses or even this article you are reading. They are only created and delivered electronically.\n\nTo generate revenue, a digital entrepreneur builds their platform through personal branding, this is particularly pertinent to gain visibility and influence more sales\n\nPersonal branding is all about positioning, Michaels tells me. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have a very large audience, all you need is to position yourself as a valuable expert and leader. This will allow the right people and the right opportunities to be attracted to you.\u201d\n\nIn the initial stage of her digital career, Michaels picked up new skills including a degree on Disruptive Strategy from Harvard Business school. She had also helped a few friends build their personal brands so it was about time to enlarge her area of reach.\n\nFirst, she buffed up her social media presence, which she says is a major part of \u201cpositioning.\u201d Social media is free to use but to gain followers or reach a larger audience, one needs to put in the work. She got her \u201cfirst-ever client from outside her circle of friends\u201d from Instagram. One would think LinkedIn could have been at the forefront of this process but, she says, in selling digital products, entrepreneurs should have their profiles on all social media platforms and utilise each platform fully.\n\nFrom getting her first international client to building a personal platform that has trained over 20,000 people in over 12 countries of the world, what Michaels really does is teach modern entrepreneurs how \u201cto build purposeful and profitable personal brands, so that they can stand out of the crowd and sell impactful products.\u201d\n\nShe does this through branding, online courses, consultations, podcasting and through her book, Show Up. For her, work revolves around helping people get the clarity and confidence to show up online, communicate their values, and create a bigger impact with their work. How she sells is mostly by referrals from people she\u2019s worked with in the past.\n\nFor some digital entrepreneurs, online sales only provide supplementary income in addition to their main jobs but for people like her, it is a full-time job that is earning her a living.\n\nWhen Michaels made her first 1000 dollars just from putting her thoughts together and selling to her audience, she became an ardent digital product creator. What is even more important to her is positioning herself not as someone whose products are for an African audience alone but for an untapped global market.\n\nAs one who speaks candidly about juggling motherhood, selling digital products is not just helping her create impact and make money while at it, it is also enabling her to work mostly from the comfort of her home, close to her daughter.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Product partnership managers are obsessed with a product\u2019s life cycle",
          "text": "Product and partnership managers are a nascent breed of individuals who act as a bridge between external partners and their companies. While product managers are responsible for hand holding a product from conception to maturity, product and partnership managers go a step further by exposing the product to valuable collaborations.\n\nI am bringing Tide Ayeni to Centre Stage because he understands the fundamentals of building partnerships into existing products. In his role as product and partnership manager at Indicina, he is responsible for driving growth through setting up successful partnerships and working with them to launch consumer credit products.\n\nWhat is your favourite part of a product life cycle?\n\nFor people who don\u2019t know, the life cycle of a product is broken into four parts: introduction (birth), growth, maturity, and decline (or death). My favourite part has to be the growth of a product. I\u2019m obsessed with numbers \u2014 as should every product and partnership manager.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, the maturity part is great because you can kind of kick back and watch your product make money. But the growth stage keeps you on your toes.\n\nSay more, please\n\nOur tech ecosystem is designed to promote collaboration and partnership. Can you grow your product successfully without partnering with a bigger company, yes. Is that method sustainable? No. Why? Because you will end up putting you and your product into a box. If you want your product to go farther than its birthplace, you need to get creative with your partnerships. Some partners can help you figure out marketing strategies and campaigns; other collaborators can help you aggressively penetrate a new market.\n\nIn your years of experience working as a product partnership manager, have you ever experienced the death of a product?\n\nOh my goodness, yes! During my time at Interswitch, we had a product that was designed to work for a specific market. I mean we put everything we had into that product but over time, we realized that it wasn\u2019t a good fit for that market. When the product was in its ideation stage, it was built for prospective retail clients. But when we went back to the drawing board, we discovered that it would work better for government agencies and hospitals. Imagine that?\n\nHow did you handle the product\u2019s demise?\n\nMy team made an executive decision to bring the product to end of life and move into maintenance mode; which means we didn\u2019t make any code improvements or fix existing bugs. We also sent out an email to all the users letting them know our decision.\n\nCan you tell us why partnerships matter in product development?\n\nBecause you can\u2019t do everything yourself. If I want to build multiple features into one product, I have two options: I can either pressure my developers to figure out how to hack the infrastructure; or I can find a partner that has already done the work and just connect my product to their rails. Collaboration is a shorter route to making things happen for your product.\n\nHow can you tell when a product is on its way to becoming powerful?\n\nFirstly, you have to consider timing. A powerful product will enter the market at the right time. If the timing isn\u2019t right, your product will not scale and adoption rates will be low.\n\nSecondly, a powerful product is backed by a powerful team. I cannot stress enough that a good team plays an important role in a product\u2019s life cycle\u2013 particularly where growth and maturity are concerned.\n\nLastly, when your market accepts and adopts your product, it is well on its way to becoming powerful.\n\nHow do you develop yourself in your role? What are you reading, watching, or listening to?\n\nI do a lot of courses. I try my best to use that to fill whatever gaps I feel like I might have in my day to day. I\u2019m a big fan of product management and business analytics courses because they directly influence the work I do at Indicina. Prodpad is a great resource for aspiring product partnership managers \u2014 they have a great blog and also offer online courses.\n\nWhat kind of skills are required for your role?\n\nPatience. Product partnership managers have to be extremely patient people. You are dealing with different personalities, clients, departments, and stakeholders. You are constantly coordinating moving parts so you cannot afford to lose your head.\n\nThen you need to know how to articulate your thoughts and translate technical requirements into plain language. You need to be able to make your future partners understand the problem you are trying to solve with your product. Eloquence sells products.\n\nFinally you need an ownership mentality. When you successfully own a product you motivate people to step out of their comfort zones. And you know what\u2019s true? Real magic happens outside your comfort zone.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges product partnership managers face on the job?\n\nThe pricing is never right; that is something that you need to understand. Your prospective partners will negotiate pricing and terms and you have to be prepared to handle that conversation.\n\nYou might also run into challenges where value is concerned. You must ensure that you and your partner are aligned in your definition of value. This way you are forging a mutually beneficial relationship that could last for a long time.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about leadership. How do you motivate your team?\n\nI listen to understand and I lead a place from understanding. That means understanding our goals, KPIs, mission, and strategies. We are working together to achieve a common goal so if we are all on the same page, we can really make magic happen.\n\nI also try my best to communicate effectively with my team and direct line managers. I leave room to receive feedback from my peers and team members. You can\u2019t just talk at people or dump information on them \u2013 you have to be open to hearing their opinions.\n\nTransparency is absolutely essential as well. When I have all the information I need then I am motivated to work hard and punch above my weight.\n\nWhat do you think about the future of technology? What are you excited about?\n\nI\u2019m really excited to see more African founders playing around with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning models. AI and machine learning will help African countries digitize their databases and information centres. When you have access to verified consumer information and data, you can offer crucial financial services like credit, debt financing, mortgages, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this edition of Centre Stage, please consider sharing it in your Whatsapp, Telegram, and LinkedIn groups.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

As founders build and successfully exit startups, they often want to invest in other founders. If they choose to go alone, they are limited either by their location or network. However, by providing a vehicle for founders to invest together, MAGIC Fund exposes these founders to opportunities they may have missed.\n\nA school of thought believes that the best venture capitalists are founders turned investors. These investors have the unique position of having been in the founders\u2019 shoes and are best placed to offer support. This has led to a rise in founders becoming investors.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for the startups? First, it\u2019s important to point out that MAGIC Fund is an early-stage investor. Consequently, they typically invest at the pre-seed or seed stages of a company\u2019s funding round. Startups would gain a network of people who have gone through similar challenges as them. Think of it as an elder brother providing dating tips for his younger brother.\n\nThis is echoed in the words of Adegoke Olubusi, Managing Partner and Co-founder of Helium Health. \u201cThere is so much money in the market now and early-stage decision making should be left in the hands of founders. Because think about it really, it makes sense to have those who have spent years battling through it in the trenches make those decisions.\u201d\n\nBy the way, twice a month, we feature an angel investor or venture capital firm investing in African startups. Here\u2019s a link to read the previous episodes.\n\nStartup funding for African startups exceed $1 billion in H1 2021\n\nAfrican startups have raised over $1.14 billion so far in 2021, more than double the amount raised at the same point in 2020. This is as reported by Maxime Bayen, company builder at GreenTec Capital. This figure only includes deals over $1m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs usual, with 48%, fintech startups account for the majority of the funding while the \u2018Big Four\u2019 \u2014 Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt \u2014 took home 80%.\n\nThere\u2019s some improvement on the gender-parity scene, with female-led companies receiving 14% of the funding, up from 2% in H1 2020.\n\nBayen\u2019s report is in line with predictions for startup funding in Africa for 2021. In 2020, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, investments in African startups fell below the numbers from 2019 with African startups receiving an estimated $1.5 billion from investors.\n\nWith the pandemic expected to ease up, AfricArena predicted that VC investments on the continent would range between $2.25 billion and $2.8 billion in 2021.\n\nAt this rate, African startups are on track to meet and possibly surpass these predictions.\n\nInterest in African startups and founders has been rising in recent years. However, these numbers are low when compared to startups in other regions. For example, Southeast Asian startups raised $6 billion in the first quarter of 2021, which is almost three times the projected investment in Africa for the entire year.\n\nFor more on startup funding in Africa, come back later in the day as I look at the numbers making up these investments.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nThe pandemic did not affect mental health the way you think.

The firm\u2019s focus will be on fintech, healthcare, Software as a Service (SaaS) and enterprise, women\u2019s health and developer tools.\n\nHowever, MAGIC Fund\u2019s support for these startups will go beyond money. The venture firm also aims to provide them with partners that have experience and expertise.\n\nAccording to a Medium post by the firm, it says \u201cWe provide guidance in the rigorous discovery of product-market fit, facilitate introductions, and support with expansion into new regions, strategy, marketing, fundraising, and hiring.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince MAGIC Fund\u2019s launch in 2017, it claims to have invested in 70 startups, including Nigerian API fintech, Mono; investment fintech, Bamboo; and home management company, Eden Life.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the firm\u2019s $1.5 million Fund I performed well with a 5x return over three years. Some of these founders joined MAGIC Fund as partners for this raise when their companies exited.\n\nA third of the fund was contributed by the firm\u2019s founder general partners (GPs), with the rest contributed by its limited partners (LPs).\n\nFor Fund II, new partners include Stitchroom\u2019s Thomas Chen, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky & Troy Osinoff, who will collectively manage North American investments.\n\nIts Africa-focused investments will be overseen by Kauffman Fellow Temi Marcella Awogboro, while Helium Health\u2019s Dimeji Sofowora and Alison Cheung handle European assets. Southeast Asia investments will be led by Payfazz\u2019s Hendra Kwik and Oxy2\u2019s Elvis Zhang.\n\nAlso, MAGIC Fund has created a cohort specifically to invest in companies founded by women, led by Alison Cheung and Tito Ovia.\n\nAccording to Adegoke Olubusi, Managing Partner of the fund, \u201cThe vision for MAGIC is going back to how early-stage venture capital began, which is, founders investing in other founders and supporting them through the journey. We\u2019re going to keep scaling this up as much as we can, across different geographies and industries, and we\u2019re very happy for the headstart we already have.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the firm is accepting pitches from founders through its website. While speaking to TechCrunch, Olubusi gave two indicators as to what MAGIC Fund looks for: founders with grit to stick through tough times and willing and open to learning while using that knowledge to succeed.",

There\u2019s also a projection that it will be worth over $28.5 billion by 2022.\n\nRecently, a lot of funding has gone into eCommerce in Egypt and the MENA region. In the last six months, we have reported various funding news about Egyptian startups in the sector, including Flextock, Bosta, and others.\n\nWe are also witnessing a changing narrative in the investments that have gone into African startups over the years. The trend suggests a potentially robust future of the ecosystem in the MENA region and Africa at large.\n\nTo know more about this raise, read this article:\n\nEgyptian eCommerce startup, MaxAB, raises $40m Series A to accelerate expansion\n\nLiquid Intelligence Technologies partners with Facebook to build a fibre network in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nOn Monday, July 4, 2021, Pan-African digital infrastructure provider, Liquid Intelligence Technologies, announced a partnership with Facebook to build an extensive long haul and metro fibre network in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nWhy the partnership? Given the long wait for sustainable Internet infrastructure in Africa, this partnership aims to improve Internet access. Together they plan to meet the growing demand for connectivity across Central Africa by providing Internet infrastructure that cuts across the East and West African coasts and Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA daunting task? Nic Rudnick, Liquid Intelligence Technologies Group CEO, claims it is the most difficult fibre build ever undertaken, but their mission to speed up the rate of Internet access in Africa is a good blend with Facebook\u2019s people connectivity ethos.\n\nFirst of its kind? This is not Facebook\u2019s first partnership with an African company to boost Internet connectivity. Apart from a few other partnerships, in May 2021, they partnered with four telecom giants and Alcatel Submarine in the region to build a 37,000 km undersea Internet cable to serve 23 African countries.\n\nDespite questions about their intentions, the resultant effects of these partnerships might speed up the improvement of Internet infrastructure in Africa.\n\nThis article provides detailed information about the partnership:\n\nFacebook partners with Pan-African tech group to build metro fibre network in Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n#TwitterBan: supposed economic effects an exaggeration?\n\nExactly 32 days ago, the Nigerian government declared a ban on microblogging site, Twitter. So far, there\u2019ve been criticisms, meetings about a likely reversal, and a court restriction preventing further acts by the government. No\n\nNetblocks.org, an online tool that calculates the financial loss attached to partial or full Internet shutdown in a country, aggregates that Nigeria loses $6,014,390 (\u20a62,177,089,051) every day because of the Twitter ban.\n\nCould this be an exaggeration? A report by Statista revealed that compared to Facebook\u2019s 86.2% of the roughly 28 million social media users in Nigeria, Twitter had a user share of 61.4%, which is less than 4 million.\n\nThis might be somewhat puzzling as many reports state that Nigeria has 40 million Twitter users. In a country with roughly between 25 and 40 million smartphone users as of 2020, this case is worthy of thorough analysis.\n\nEven though research published in 2019 revealed that government-led Internet shutdowns cost the global economy $8 billion as it disrupted the flow of online-based businesses, access to information, and stifled global tourism revenue.\n\nWhether or not the economic loss from #TwitterBan is as staggering as it seems is a valid case point.\n\nBe on the lookout for Emmanuel Paul\u2019s analysis.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nPaystack becomes WooCommerce\u2019s preferred payment partner in Africa.

Wike\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPORT HARCOURT \u2013 The governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike says he never promised to solve all the socio-economic and infrastructural problems of the State during his tenure.\n\nHence, he said, it is preposterous for the opposition to continue to live in denial of his sterling performance as governor, just because he has not addressed all the needs of the State.\n\nGovernor Wike made this assertion during the inauguration of the ultramodern National Union of Rivers State Students, (NURSS) national secretariat built by his administration at the Rivers state University on Monday night.\n\nThe governor maintained that irrespective of the country\u2019s current economic challenges, the State government has made tremendous progress in tackling some of the infrastructural deficit it inherited.\n\nTo this end, he said it is preposterous for the opposition not to acknowledge that he never promised to fix all the problems of the State during his tenure.\n\n\u201d I never said I will finish the whole work in Rivers State. Did I say so? Even if you keep me here for 40 years, I cannot finish the work in Rivers State. What we have said is, go to any local government, you\u2019ll see our impact. I said in Omuma, we did so-so number kilometers of road. What you should bother yourself with is to go and check.\u201d\n\nHe further added: \u201cOn Saturday, we were in Opobo. The issue is, is there road to Opobo?\u201d\n\nThe governor urged the leadership of NURSS to resist being used by disgruntled politicians to cause friction between them and State government. According to him, it is unethical for them to allow politicians to instigate them against the State.\n\n\u201cSometimes, most of you leave what you\u2019re supposed to do and concern yourself with irrelevant things, and allow politicians to use you to come and block Government House.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explained that by the time he assumed office in 2015, there was virtually no State government presence in the University. According to him, the previous administration which wasted the State\u2019s resources, completely neglected the institution.\n\nHe attributed the current ranking of the State University as one of the best in the country, to the huge investment his administration has made in the past six years to improve infrastructure, capacity building and welfare of the workers.\n\nPerforming the inauguration, Senator Bennett Birabi said since 1999, no governor of the State has worked conscientiously to improve infrastructure and enhance the wellbeing of the people, particularly during their second term, like Governor Wike.\n\nHe urged students to make judicious use for the edifice and shun social vices like cultism.\n\nEarlier, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Special Projects, George-Kelly D.Alabo, said the NURSS secretariat has offices, conference hall ,cafeteria , ICT centre and a 400 capacity auditorium.\n\nAlabo, who described the secretariat as the biggest in West Africa, said NURSS is expected to generate at least N50 million as revenue from the complex annually.\n\nThe Commissioner of Education, Professor Kaniye Ebeku, thanked the governor for erecting a befitting edifice for NURSS.\n\nVice Chancellor of the Rivers State University, Professor Nlerum Okogbule commended the governor for his unwavering commitment to improve academic environment in the University and enhance academic excellence.\n\nPro-Chancellor of the University, Justice Iche Ndu (rtd) said when the history of the State will be written, Governor Wike\u2019s name will be written in gold for his commitment to good governance.\n\nNURSS national president, Levi Z.George, said the inauguration of the secretariat marks a major milestone in the history of the union.\n\nHe explained that the gesture to build the secretariat is a further demonstration of the importance Governor Wike attaches to education.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPORT-HARCOURT \u2013 The governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike says only compromised academics who are willing to submit names of politically exposed lecturers as returning officers to rig elections for the ruling party, are being appointed as Vice Chancellors of federal universities.\n\nGovernor Wike, who warned Vice Chancellors and lecturers to be wary of attempts by some unscrupulous politicians to use them to manipulate elections, declared that those contemplating to rig elections in Rivers State will be treated as a coup plotters.\n\nHe stated this during the foundation laying ceremony for the construction of 9200 capacity ultramodern convocation arena of the University of Port Harcourt by the Rivers State government on Tuesday.\n\nGovernor Wike said it is worrisome that Nigeria has degenerated to the point where politicians now influence who becomes a Vice Chancellor of a federal government for the purposes of rigging elections.\n\n\u201cLet me warn, not one person will dare to rig election in Rivers State. Not one person will dare it. I have told people, allow university community to produce those who will be leaders of this country. Don\u2019t turn university community to be where you will have politicians who manipulate and change the mandate of the people. Anybody who does that, you know it is a coup and you know the punishment for coup plotters.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed that the reason why there is so much tussle these days on who becomes Vice Chancellor of federal universities, is because of political interference by extraneous forces.\n\nHe described as heartrending a situation whereby lecturers who are supposed to revered in society, wilfully compromise their integrity, just to become Vice Chancellor, who will afterwards be used to manipulate elections.\n\n\u201cThese days , you see a lecturer, a PhD holder, a professor ready to soil his name, to allow himself to be kidnapped and taken somewhere to sign result and to declare somebody who did not win election winner.\u201d\n\nThe governor enjoined desperate politicians in the ruling party not to dent the integrity of the university system because of their inordinate ambition.\n\nGovernor Wike warned that any Vice Chancellor that allows himself to be used to rig election in Rivers State, should be prepared for the consequences of such hideous act.\n\n\u201cIf you want to play politics with us, I will rub you mud. If you want to join us (politicians), openly come and join us. But if you want to hide under the university.\u201d\n\nThe governor declared that 2023 general election will be completely different from the 2019 election which was manipulated by the ruling party. He insisted that attempts to prevent transmission to election results electronically will be resisted.\n\n\u201cINEC knows that they have to be prepared in 2023. And that is why we will resist any attempt for anybody to manipulate the amendment of the Electoral Act, to say that election results will not be transmitted electronically. That will not happen. If you want the vote of the people to count, the result must be transmitted electronically.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike stated that as an alumni of the University of Port Harcourt, his business is not to play politics in the University, but to see how he can contribute to the development of the institution.\n\nHe promised to complete a primary school building in the university that was abandoned by the previous administration for inexplicable reason.\n\nThe Acting Vice Chancellor of University of Port Harcourt, Professor Stephen Okodudu commended Governor Wike for consistently identifying with the ideals and aspiration of the university.\n\n\u201cYou have continued to support the successive administrations of the University through donation of funds and provision of social infrastructure to give meaning to the lives of staff and students. I recall with nostalgia, that Your Excellency attracted then construction of the Faculties of Law and Social Sciences buildings while serving as the Hon. Minister of State for Education.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Governing Council of the University, Senator Andrew Uchendu applauded Governor Wike for laying the foundation for what will be the best, iconic convocation arena in West Africa.\n\nPerforming the inauguration of the new convocation arena, immediate past Vice Chancellor of the University, Professor Ndowa E. Lale said Governor Wike decision to construct the new convocation arena is a further demonstration that he has a heart to add value to the institution.\n\nHe declared that history will be kind to Governor Wike because he has deliberately worked conscientiously for public good.\n\nEarlier, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Special Projects, George Kelly D. Alabo said 9200 capacity convocation arena is going to have convertible compartments, offices, assembly hall, 750kva transformer and will be completed in 14 months.\n\nHe further added: \u201cThis structure will not only be aesthetically pleasing, it will also be structurally sound.\n\n...",

And that the new borrowing of N2.3 trillion will part-finance the deficit in the 2021 budget.\n\nIn his presentation, Mr Ordia said the request is not new as it was approved in the borrowing plan when the national assembly passed the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cWhat we are about to pass is not a new borrowing, it has been approved in the 2021 budget,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the approval, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the National Assembly must make sure that there are no frivolous expenditures by the executive.\n\n\u201cLet me thank the committee, this is not a new loan. This is a borrowing plan we have approved. What we have done is to provide the necessary resolutions for the implementation of it.\n\n\u201cEvery cent counts. Our committees must be alive to oversee it. No frivolous expenditures should be entertained.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s 2021 budget already has a deficit of N5.6 trillion.\n\nThe president had said the loan will be used to fund \u201cprojects from priority sectors of the economy namely: Power, Transportation, Agriculture and Rural Development, Education, Health, provision of Counterpart Funding for Multilateral and Bilateral Projects, Defence and Water Resources.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: \u20ac995m\n\nThe approval of the president\u2019s loan request comes amid Nigeria\u2019s growing deficit and debt crisis.\n\nMr Buhari had, in October, acknowledged the fact that the deficit in the proposed budget was more than the three per cent threshold as established by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007.\n\nHe said the measure was necessary due to the \u201cexistential challenge of Coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath; I believe that this provides a justification to exceed the threshold as provided for by this law.\u201d\n\nIn April, the National Assembly approved loan requests of $1.5billion and \u20ac995million for the Buhari administration.",

He would have probably made more money, if this is sited along Akoka, UNILAG student area, he would have made more money but he chose to come here to also establish his own presence back home.\n\n\u201cIf all of us who are successful outside Ekiti, put back into the community, because the government can not do it alone, we would have totally transformed our state even beyond the level it is now.\n\n\u201cThat is what this sort of institution does for the development of the community. That is why every Ekiti community wants an establishment of government because they know the multiplier effect of such establishment.\n\n\u201cWhich is why having a state of the art hostel to be patronized by students in an affordable environment like this, Manhattan hall, is something we must celebrate,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Bishop Ajakaye, who was also the Chairman of the occasion, encouraged youths to think positively and be optimistic in every situation. He said, like God they should be a builder who sees opportunity in every challenge rather than seeing challenges in every opportunity.\n\nAlso in his welcome address , the proprietor of the Victoria Mahatma Hall, Mr Goke Egunjobi who called for more presence of private sector in the State, said his intention of building the edifice in Ekiti was bore out of his desire to support government\u2019s effort in providing educational infrastructure for students.\n\nHe explained that the hostel would provide the same comfort that students should enjoy back home, adding that such comfort would boost the academic performance of the students.\n\nMr Egunjobi challenged private sector and entrepreneurs to complement Government efforts in creating small and medium scale industry in the State.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has rejected the southern governors\u2019 position that the south should produce the next president come 2023.\n\nThe NEF said the North would not be gagged and compelled into yielding a democratically elected office that is the right of all to any interest through intimidation.\n\nAt the end of its meeting in Lagos Monday, the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum (SOGF) among other things \u201creiterates its commitment to the politics of equity, fairness and unanimously agrees that the presidency of Nigeria be rotated between Southern and Northern Nigeria and resolved that the next president of Nigeria should emerge from the Southern Region.\u201d\n\nBesides, the forum also \u201cfrowns at selective criminal administration of Justice and resolved that arrests should be made within the ambit of the law and fundamental human rights; set a timeline of Wednesday, 1st September, 2021 for the promulgation of the anti open grazing law in all member states; and resolved that funds deducted from the Federation Account for the Nigeria Police Security Trust Fund should be distributed among the States and Federal Government to combat security challenges.\u201d\n\nNEF kicks\n\nRejecting the southern governors\u2019 position Tuesday in a statement, NEF\u2019s Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said as far as the North was concerned, the idea that it would be indirectly threatened or intimidated or blackmailed into yielding an office which ought to be settled democratically is not acceptable.\n\nThe NEF \u201csees the decision of the southern governors as an expression of sentiment that could be best discussed within a political process.\n\n\u201cWe are running a democratic government and decisions over where the next president comes from are basically decisions that will be made by voters exercising their rights to choose which candidate best serves their interest.\u201d\n\nBaba-Ahmed further said the southern governors come from the two dominant parties namely; the APC and PDP, and should use their influence to in those parties to make things work in their favour.\n\nHe said \u201cthe way it should be done was that the southern governors should influence their parties to zone the presidency to southern states and then work to convince Nigerian voters from all parts of the country to vote for that candidate.\u201d\n\nThe NEF said the democratic rights of Nigerian citizens to vote for a candidate of their choice \u201ccannot be snatched by threats or intimidation,\u201d stressing that politicians were becoming very lazy to think they will be given leadership in a manner that suggests an ultimatum.\n\nIt\u2019s gang up-Yabagi\n\nAlso, national Chairman of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Sani Yabagi, has likened the southern governors to leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) and Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho.\n\nFeaturing on Channels Television early morning show-Sunrise Daily monitored by one of our correspondents, Yabagi said the resolutions were divisive and belittles the offices of the leaders.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think the coming together of the governors of the southern extraction, to me, believe you me, it is a very wrong way to go about the issue of politics that affects the whole nation. Because the message here unfortunately is like ganging up against the rest of Nigeria particularly the north by the state actors, who should be the ones that will protect the unity of this country and ensure that all the parts of this country will be comfortable with whoever that will emerge as the president of this country.\u201d\n\nYabagi said the content of the forum\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 was targeted at the North and its people.\n\n\u201cAll the things listed in that communiqu\u00e9 or in their meeting, seem to be the kind of ganging up against the north. When you look at the grazing, insecurity, when you look at the issue of politics and 2023, how can we have elected officers, governors for that matter coming out in this manner to emphasis things that divide us and not talking about the things that unite the country.\n\n\u201cIt beats my imagination. It is unfortunate that we don\u2019t have governors today coming together for issues of principles\u2026These governors are not anything better than Igboho or Kanu\u2026\u201d, the ADP chief further said.\n\n\u2026CNG too\n\nSimilarly, the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) described the southern governors\u2019 move as a gang up said they observed the gang up against the North in particular, to force a regional shift of the presidency in 2023 by whatever means and tactics are clearly undemocratic.\n\nCNG spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, stated the position in a statement Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHe said the North-central has not had any representation in top executive positions of President/Vice President since return of the nation to democracy in 1999, and therefore has legitimate basis to aspire for the presidency in 2023.\n\nHe said \u201cthe North is represented by 250 ethnic groups whose right to aspire to the presidency would be circumvented by a delusional rotators principles and these include people of Yoruba ancestry who belong to the geopolitical North.\u201d\n\nThe group warned the southern governors and those it described as their northern collaborators that \u201cany attempt to ride on the back of such gratuitous insults to democratic fair play and crass political opportunists, incompetent leadership on the nation in the name of rotation would not be accepted and shall be vehemently be resisted.\n\n\u201cWe specifically warn Kashim Shettima, Nasir el-Rufai and other northern collaborators of the futility of pursuing their personal exploits for the vice presidency through this impossible battle to hand over our future and the entire North to interests that see united and numerically superior North as a major political obstacle.\n\n\u201cOn their part northern collaborators, one of whom led, and the other is leading administrations that have acquired the reputation of being the worst in the history of their respective states in terms of any capacity to generate confidence in achieving credible goals, should note that the extent of their collaboration would not go unnoticed, and in the fullness of time, they will be called to account.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Federal Government to take immediate steps to disband all militias and armed groups in Nigeria by resort to the use of force if needs be, to ensure that no group has the capacity to challenge the state in its prerogative to maintain law and order, and protect citizens\u2019 lives and properties.\n\n\u201cThat the Southern Governors resolutions in that regard has further exposed a deliberate attempt to impose a contentious system of rotational presidency that turns all democratic norms.\u201d\n\nSouthern reps express support\n\nIn the midst of all this, however, southern lawmakers in the House of Representatives have endorsed their governors\u2019 position on 2023.\n\nIn a statement by chairman of the southern reps caucus, Victor Nwokolo, the lawmakers said: \u201cWe note that the demand that the next President of Nigeria should come from the southern region unambiguously represents the opinion of the majority of Nigerians across board, in tandem with the already established rotation of presidency position between southern and northern Nigeria,\u201d the statement reads in part.\n\nAlthough the rotation of the presidency is not enshrined in the constitution, it has however been a gentlemanly agreement in the PDP.\n\nThe lawmakers also condemned the reported move by the House committee on electoral matters to remove electronic transmission of results.\n\nAlthough the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila denied the report of changes to the bill while reacting to a point of order raised by a member of the House, the southern lawmakers said any \u201cattempt to tamper with the Electoral Act to remove electronic transmission of result is, therefore, a malicious and unpatriotic act aimed to emasculate our electoral system, undermine our democracy and destabilise our dear country.\u201d\n\nDiri pleads\n\nAlso in some reassuring words, Bayelsa state Governor Douye Diri has declared that southern politicians would lobby their northern counterparts towards achieving the presidency for the South in 2023.\n\nDiri, who spoke in an interview monitored on Channels TV Sunrise programme, said the decision would not be imposed on the people.\n\nHe traced the history of Nigeria\u2019s Presidency in 1999 with former President Olusegun Obasanjo from the South, noting that with incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari from the North set to complete his two terms of eight years, the North should reciprocate the gesture for the South to take the Presidency.\n\n\u201cAt this point, what we need to do is lobbying. We have taken a position and our position is a political position. We don\u2019t need to impose it on people. Now we have to talk to people, lobby them and make them reason why our position would be beneficial to the country and beneficial for the smooth power transfer from one region to the other.\n\n\u201cThe North has what it takes to produce the President and ditto the South. The South also has what it takes to produce the President. And for us to live harmoniously with respect for each other and believe that power actually comes from God. We have this relationship and understanding for eight years that is two terms by our constitution one region would be there and then the next eight years; it would transfer to another region.\n\n\u201cNow we are seeing the last term of President Buhari and it is only usual, normal and acceptable to us from the South that this would be reciprocated by our brothers from the North and that is why we took that decision yesterday to say that in 2023, the President should actually come from the South.\n\n\u201cWhatever we have done is not constitutionally backed up. It is not constitutional that the President has to rotate between the North and the South, it is more of gentleman agreement and to enhance peaceful coexistence and for us to have a democracy that all the groups and ethnic nationalities and all the regions would key in and buy in.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze tasks Amaechi, Onu, others\n\nMeanwhile, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has urged the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Senator Rochas Okorocha; ex-Anambra state Governor Peter Obi; Ebonyi state Governor David Umahi, his Enugu counterpart, Ifeanyi Uguwanyi, and the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, to commence consultation with other regions ahead of the 2023 presidency.\n\nThe apex Igbo socio-political organisation made the remark while commending Southern governors for what it termed the \u201cpolitical wills and dexterity\u201d to set a timeline for the commencement of the law banning open grazing.\n\nSecretary-General of the group, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro said the decision was in line with the collective aspirations of southern and Middle Belt Nigerians to have a lasting solution to the farmers/herders clash that had lingered for long.\n\nThe group said the Southern Governors Forum\u2019s resolution on 2023 presidency had put the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on the spot.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is a great decision to make the PDP revert to her original constitutionally preserved rotational Presidency which the PDP NWC led by Uche Secondus is trying to thwart for greedy purposes.\n\n\u201cThis shows that any political party that \u2018anti-clockwise\u2019 zones her presidential ticket outside the South will undoubtedly lose the bloc votes (of the South) to political parties that respect the aspirations of Southern Governors and the people.\n\n\u201cThe reinforcement of the collective bargaining of Igbos to succeed President Buhari in 2023 is the major responsibility of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. Apart from Owelle Rochas Okorocha, we are calling on Igbo Presidential hopefuls to boldly commence consultative outreach programs across the country and keep the hopes alive for 2023 Igbo Presidency Project. Mr. Peter Obi, Engr David Umahi, Ogbonnaya Onu, Chibuike Amaechi, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and others should open conversation with other regions for 2023. Igbo Presidency is the most equitable and justified project that Nigerians will gainfully embrace in 2023, as there is nothing to lose if Igbo succeed Buhari in 2023.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

I am highly impressed with the conduct of operations that flushed out the terrorists and criminals from their strongholds.\n\n\u201cYou have saved Nigeria from disintegration and have demonstrated a high sense of professionalism in your operations. I want to assure you that this Government and indeed the Nigerian People deeply appreciate your noble sacrifices to safeguard our nation.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you of my government\u2019s commitment to your welfare. We will continue to provide you with the needed support to enhance your welfare. In the same vein, I am aware of the challenges confronting the Nigerian Army such as inadequate equipment and insufficient funds for maintenance and training as well as other logistics constraints affecting your operational efficiency. As you may be aware, my government has put in place a mechanism that would address these problems in phases albeit in the face of other competing national demands.\u201d\n\nThe president said: \u201cI charge the officers and men of the Nigerian Army to be proactive in evolving new strategies, methods and techniques of winning the hearts and minds in the current phase of operations.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the Army for restoring the internal security of the country back to normal, he said \u201cgovernment services and private businesses have since resumed in areas hitherto controlled by these terrorists.\n\n\u201cTherefore, as we celebrate the achievements of the Nigerian Army and all security agencies, I would like to thank all well-meaning Nigerians for their support and understanding.\u201d\n\nBuhari also assured Nigerians that the security challenges confronting the nation would soon be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cThis government appreciates and commends recent efforts by individuals, community members, traditional leaders and numerous civil society organisations especially the youths that are cooperating and supporting the security agencies in exposing all agents of destruction and instability in our polity.\n\n\u201cAs a responsible government, we are conscious of the challenges being faced by the citizenry. I would like to assure you that these would be resolved in the shortest possible time,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Chief of Army Staff, Major-General Faruk Yahaya, said NADCEL presented opportunity for the NA to also deliberate on its future by fine-tuning and redirecting its efforts to remain in perfect harmony with its constitutional responsibility of defending the territorial integrity of Nigeria and its Constitution.\n\nYahaya said since assuming command, he had repositioned the Army to tackle security challenges confronting the nation.\n\n\u201cFor the past one month or thereabout, the Nigerian Army has been repositioning itself, as an Army ready to accomplish assigned missions within a joint environment in the defence of our dear nation.\n\n\u201cIt is through our concerted efforts that the activities of insurgents, terrorists\u2019 secessionists and other violent criminal elements that threatened the very corporate existence of this country have been greatly reduced.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

We are supposed to meet and discuss this issue among ourselves, among the political class,\u201d he explained, as he called for caution so as not to overheat the polity in the lead-up to the 2023 polls.\n\n\u201cThis statement that people are saying that the president must go to the south, I want them to remove the word \u2018must.'\u201d\n\nHe also refuted speculations that his stance on zoning was due to his political interests.\n\n\u201cAnd I have said it before, I am not interested in becoming the vice president of the country, neither the president of the nation but I want to say the right thing,\u201d Zulum added, doubling down on his earlier stance.\n\nREAD ALSO: Southern Governors Set Deadline For Promulgation Of Anti-Open Grazing Law\n\nA Hotly-Debated Policy\n\nSince the return of democracy in 1999, Nigeria has had an unwritten agreement for the rotation of power between the largely Muslim northern region and the Christian-dominated south.\n\nIncumbent President Muhammadu Buhari who hails from the northern state of Katsina is expected to hand over to a president from the south in 2023 in line with the rotation principle.\n\nThe arrangement which is often referred to as \u201czoning,\u201d however, continues to draw intense debates from political leaders in the country.\n\nAlthough proponents of the zoning principle, maintain that the power-sharing deal has helped in boosting unity among regions in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, critics believe the policy is outdated, undermines democracy, and panders to ethnoreligious sentiments.\n\n\u201cZoning is a party issue, every party has the right to say where they want a position to come from but in APC, there is no issue of zoning,\u201d a senator, Orji Kalu said late last year during a meeting with -ex-Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida (rtd), and former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd), at their residences. \u201cAnybody can contest for the presidency.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday commended the nation\u2019s security and intelligence agencies for their work in arresting secessionist Nnamdi Kanu and raiding the home of \u2018Yoruba Nation\u2019 activist Sunday Igboho.\n\nThe President\u2019s praise was contained in a statement signed by his spokesperson Garba Shehu.\n\nAccording to the statement, President Buhari said the security agencies demonstrated \u201csignificant deftness, guile and secrecy in carrying out these missions.\n\n\u201cThis level of professionalism must be sustained and brought to bear as we focus on extracting from our society those who have found a new trade in targeting students, rural dwellers and our citizens in the North-West.\n\n\u201cThe nation recognizes their efforts and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nRead Mr Shehu\u2019s full statement below:\n\nSTATE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE\n\nPRESIDENCY STATEMENT ON THE RECENT SUCCESSES OF SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES\n\nLast week, we saw the enhanced collaboration of the Nigerian Law Enforcement Agencies, as they executed with great synchronization arrests of individuals who had inflicted pain and hardships on fellow citizens.\n\nThe subversive leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) a group known for its murderous actions and virulent messaging was detained as a result of cross-border cooperation. This international operation was executed in a closely coordinated fashion following which he was handed over to our National Intelligence Agency, and then returned to Nigeria to face the Law.\n\nThe violence inspired by IPOB has led to hundreds of fatalities, particularly targeted at Government assets and Law Enforcement Agents. Additionally, there have been at last count, fifty (55) separate violent attacks, heavily concentrated in the South-East, which heaped further hardship on our honest and hardworking citizens, preventing them from earning their livelihood and going about their normal lives.\n\nThe Government had long been monitoring the activities of IPOB and had strong cause to believe that their funding sources include proceeds of suspected illicit criminal activities. By this singular action of our Security Forces, sanity, calm and peace has been returned to our communities who previously lived in constant fear of these misguided elements.\n\nIn furtherance of continued diligent work, the State Security Service on Thursday, 1st July raided the residence of a militant ethnic Secessionist, who has also been conducting acts of terror and disturbing the peace under the guise of protecting fellow \u201ckinsmen\u201d.\n\nHis seditious utterances and antics, which he is known to have publicly expressed, have overtime morphed into very hateful and vile laden speeches. It must be highlighted that the government respects fundamental rights of citizens to express their views and recognizes this as a democratic tenet. However, any attempt to build an Armoury coupled with plans either subtle or expressed to undermine our unity as a nation will not be condoned.\n\nMr. President\u2019s directives to Security Services regarding anyone seen to be carrying arms, particularly AK-47 are clear and require no further illumination. Assault weapons are not tools of peace loving people and as such, regardless of who they are and where they are from, the Security Agencies should treat them all the same.\n\nThe successes of our Security Agencies must be commended as they have demonstrated significant deftness, guile and secrecy in carrying out these missions. This level of professionalism must be sustained and brought to bear as we focus on extracting from our society those who have found a new trade in targeting students, rural dwellers and our citizens in the North-West. The nation recognizes their efforts and sacrifice.\n\nGarba Shehu\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President\n\n(Media & Publicity)\n\nJuly 6, 2021",
          "summary": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday commended the nation\u2019s security and intelligence agencies for their work in arresting secessionist Nnamdi Kanu and raiding the home of \u2018Yoruba Nation\u2019 activist Sunday Igboho.\nAccording to the statement, President Buhari said the security agencies demonstrated \u201csignificant deftness, guile and secrecy in carrying out these missions.\nAssault weapons are not tools of peace loving people and as such, regardless of who they are and where they are from, the Security Agencies should treat them all the same.\nThe successes of our Security Agencies must be commended as they have demonstrated significant deftness, guile and secrecy in carrying out these missions.\nThe nation recognizes their efforts and sacrifice.",

          "text": "Megaship the MV Ever Given, which blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March, weighed anchor Wednesday following a compensation deal between Egypt and the vessel\u2019s Japanese owner after having been impounded for more than 100 days.\n\nAn AFP correspondent said the ship started to move north from the central canal city of Ismailia towards the Mediterranean, shortly after 11:30 am local time (0930 GMT).\n\nThe nearly 200,000-tonne container vessel became wedged across the canal during a sandstorm on March 23, blocking a vital artery from Asia to Europe that carries 10 percent of global maritime trade and pumps vital revenues into Egyptian state coffers.\n\nAfter a round-the-clock salvage operation to dislodge it, Egypt seized the ship and demanded compensation from Japanese owners Shoei Kisen Kaisha for lost canal revenues, salvage costs and damage to the canal.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced Sunday that a final deal had been reached, without disclosing the amount of compensation to be paid.\n\nIn a statement, it said the ship would leave on Wednesday.\n\nCairo had initially demanded $916 million in compensation before slashing that to around $550 million, but the final amount has been the subject of tough negotiations.\n\nThe SCA announced last month that it had signed a non-disclosure agreement with the Japanese firm ahead of reaching a final deal.\n\nSCA chairman Osama Rabie, in a televised interview on Sunday, hailed the deal.\n\n\u201cWe maintained our rights and we kept good relations with our clients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Millions in revenues \u2013\n\nCairo, which earns over $5 billion a year from the Suez, lost between $12 million and $15 million in revenues for each day the waterway was closed, according to the SCA.\n\nThe MV Ever Given\u2019s grounding and the intensive salvage efforts needed to refloat it also resulted in significant damage to the canal.\n\nIn April, maritime data company Lloyd\u2019s List said the blockage by the vessel, longer than four football fields, held up some $9.6 billion-worth of cargo each day it was stuck.\n\nThe Taiwanese-operated and Panama-flagged vessel was refloated on March 29, and tailbacks totalling 420 vessels at the northern and southern entrances to the canal were cleared in early April.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Ismailia Economic Court ruled the seized ship with its crew on board was being released following a request from the SCA.\n\nAccording to tracking service MarineTraffic, the ship had been moored in the northern part of Great Bitter Lake.\n\nRabie said the MV Ever Given had suffered \u201cno leakage\u201d and was leaving after a signing ceremony.\n\nHe said Egypt would also receive a 75-tonne tugboat from Shoei Kisen Kaisha as part of the compensation package, and noted that the family of one rescue worker who died during the salvage operation would also be compensated.\n\n\u201cThe Suez canal has always been a site of sacrifices since it was built,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Canal expansion \u2013\n\nThe Suez Canal earned Egypt just over $5.7 billion in the 2019/20 fiscal year, according to official figures \u2014 little changed from the $5.3 billion earned back in 2014.\n\nEven with the grounding of the ship, Rabie said Sunday that canal revenues in the first half of the year had topped $3 billion.\n\nBut officials have been keen to avoid reputational damage from the incident, trumpeting Egyptian efforts in the salvage operation.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi swiftly pledged investment to avoid any repetition of the crisis, and in May approved a two-year project to widen and deepen the southern part of the waterway where the ship ran aground.\n\nSisi had overseen the $8 billion expansion of a northern section of the canal to much fanfare in 2014-15.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Gunmen suspected to be bandits on motorcycles have launched a fresh onslaught on Tsauwa village in Batsari Local Government Area of Katsina State, killing no fewer than 21 persons, including children and women.\n\nSome houses, food items and shops as well as motorcycles were also burnt during the invasion.\n\nMany other residents sustained gunshot wounds in the incident that lasted from 5 pm to 6 pm on Monday, while many survivors have fled the area.\n\nA prominent leader in the village, Mr. Suleiman Abdulkadir, who confirmed the incident to THISDAY yesterday, said the marauding bandits invaded the village with sophisticated weapons when most of the residents were returning from their farms and started shooting sporadically.\n\nThe member representing Batsari constituency at the state House of Assembly, Hon. Jabiru Yusuf Yau-yau, who also confirmed the attack to THISDAY, said the hoodlums killed many people.\n\nHe added that the state Commissioner for Police, Mr. Sanusi Buba, and other top security officers have visited the village.\n\nAbdulkadir stated that hundreds of residents, mostly women and children who survived the deadly invasion, had fled the village to Batsari, the headquarters of Batsari Local Government Area for fear of future occurrence.\n\nHe said: \u201cAbout 270 bandits riding on motorcycles attacked our village (Tsauwa) yesterday (Monday) and killed 21 people. Right now, we have 21 dead bodies and none of the bodies have been taken to the cemetery and those who survived the attack are moving to Batsari town.\n\n\u201cLast time they killed 38 people and even a few days ago they ambushed some people and killed nine. This is the third attack on Tsauwa village. In the first one, they killed 38 people; the second one, they killed 11 people and yesterday (Monday) they killed 21. See their corpses laying down here; even the burial has not commenced.\u201d\n\nHe added that because of banditry and other nefarious activities afflicting farming communities in Batsari LGA, many farmers have abandoned the farm and left their villages for safer places.\n\nHe said even those who farmed last year could not access their farms for harvest because bandits had taken over their farmlands.\n\n\u201cThe only way for farmers in this village to be able to produce this season is for the government to provide enough security personnel for us. We have just started planting our crops and they had stopped us from farming. Government should please and please help us with enough security personnel that would remain in this village,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhen contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Gambo Isah, a Superintendent of Police, confirmed the incident and promised to brief journalists later.\n\nHe was yet to hold the press briefing as at press time.\n\nFrancis Sardauna in Katsina",

          "title": "Nigeria: Bill on State Police, Regional Security Outfits Scales Second Reading",
          "text": "The House of Representatives has passed for second reading, a bill seeking to amend 1999 Constitution to allow for the creation of state police and legalise regional security outfits.\n\nThe bill also provides that the current police system will be decentralised by moving police from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent list.\n\nChairman of the House Committee on Judiciary, Hon. Onofiok Luke, who sponsored the bill, said in the explanatory note that the bill sought to alter the constitution \u201cto provide for state police and other state government security services to enhance security and preservation of lives and properties in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nLeading the debate on the bill at the plenary yesterday, Luke said the primary responsibility of every government all over the world is to protect and preserve the lives and property of its citizens and to maintain law and order.\n\nHe stated that many years after independence, Nigeria has continually been beset with insecurity ranging from terrorism, kidnapping, armed robbery, and domestic violence.\n\nLuke said though there was no society without crime or manifestation of criminal behaviour, the inability to reduce crimes to the barest minimum crime should be regarded as an indictment of the country\u2019s security structure.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe federal structure of our security does not encourage community policing or localisation of policing. Recruitment and subsequent deployment of police officers in their local area is one of the major ways of curbing crime. Such officers understand the area, terrain, language, behaviour and attitude of the people he or she is policing.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker lamented that Nigeria, a country with over 201 million people, is grossly under-policed with about 400,000 police personnel, stressing that this number falls far short of the United Nation\u2019s recommendation of one policeman to 400 citizens.\n\nLuke explained that the bill seeks to amend the principal law by removing police and other government security services from the exclusive legislative list and inserting it in the concurrent legislative list so that both the federal and state governments can legislate on the subject.\n\nContributing, the Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, said the bill was germane considering the present security challenges facing the country.\n\nOkechukwu stated: \u201cAs a matter of fact, the exclusive list needs to shed weight and if it is going to shed weight with regard to making our country more efficient and secure, the better we are for it. As a matter of fact, there is no state in this federation that does not run a security outfit. No state! Whether it is Amotekun or Hisbah or Vigilante or Ebube Agu, whichever name you call it, they all run it. But what character do they possess? What ingredients are they lacking? They are lacking the power to ordinarily bear arms and to arrest and prosecute.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker added that there was a need to bring it to the fore the need to solve the challenges the country is facing.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be living and pretending that everything is okay. Nothing is okay. If 13 schools were closed in Kaduna, it is not a joke. We need to address this and address this seriously,\u201d Okechukwu said.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "text": "England are preparing to face Denmark in the semi-finals of Euro 2020 at Wembley on Wednesday, knowing victory will secure them a place in a major men\u2019s tournament final for the first time since 1966.\n\nGareth Southgate\u2019s side will face Italy in Sunday\u2019s final if they defeat the Danes in front of around 60,000 mostly England fans at Wembley.\n\nMillions more are expected to cheer the Three Lions on from home, in pubs and designated fan parks after a peak TV audience of 20.9 million watched them cruise past Ukraine 4-0 in the quarter-finals last Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have as good a football history as we like to believe sometimes,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cThese players are making massive strides and breaking down barriers all the time.\n\n\u201cWe have never been to a European Championship final so we can be the first England team to do that which is really exciting.\u201d\n\nTravel restrictions imposed by the UK to curb the spread of coronavirus means fans based in Denmark will not be able to cheer on their team at Wembley.\n\nInstead some 6,000 tickets for the semi-final have been made available to Danes living in the UK. The Danish FA has sent 1,000 jerseys and other red and white merchandise to London for fans attending.\n\nEngland, who have never won the European Championship, are looking to reach a first major tournament final for 55 years.\n\nThey have appeared in five previous World Cup or European Championship semi-finals but only advanced once.\n\nHowever, there is mounting excitement \u2013 and hope has turned to expectation \u2013 that Southgate\u2019s side can deliver a first major tournament triumph since the 1966 World Cup.\n\nCars and homes are decked out with England flags while pubs have been given permission to stay open an extra 45 minutes until 23:15 BST on Sunday, in case the final at Wembley, which kicks-off at 20:00, goes to extra time and penalties.\n\nMeanwhile, England supporters have been serenading their team through the tournament with chants of \u2018Football\u2019s Coming Home\u2019, the anthem that first became popular when the Three Lions reached the Euro 96 semi-finals.\n\nAsked what it would mean to ruin England\u2019s dreams of Euro glory, Denmark keeper Kasper Schmeichel said: \u201cHas it ever been home? I don\u2019t know. Have you ever won it?\u201d\n\nBut England captain Harry Kane said the team was in a strong position to put that right.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right in terms it hasn\u2019t \u2018come home\u2019 in this competition for us,\u201d said Kane. \u201cWe know if we can get it right then it should be enough to get us over the line.\u201d\n\nNineteen-year-old Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka has recovered from the knock that forced him to miss the Ukraine win but Southgate must decide whether to stick with the same XI that started in Rome or make changes.\n\nThe England boss used a 4-2-3-1 formation last time out and has to choose whether to revert back to a 3-4-3 set-up with the aim of stifling the Danes.\n\nDenmark boss Kasper Hjulmand has no fresh injury concerns and could name an unchanged starting line-up for the third game despite the head coach admitting that fatigue is a concern.\n\nHjulmand said on Monday \u201cthe tank was emptied\u201d during the quarter-final win over the Czech Republic.\n\nEuro 2020 has already seen England end a 55-year wait for a knockout tie victory over Germany but Southgate is only too aware the Three Lions have fallen agonisingly short on their past four semi-final appearances at major tournaments.\n\nIn 2018, his side were denied a place in the World Cup final after an extra time defeat to Croatia in Moscow.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for the game, the players are ready, they have got tremendous experience themselves having been in this situation before,\u201d said Southgate.\n\n\u201cOur preparations have been calm and we know we are playing a very good opponent. It\u2019s going to be a really tight game and an exciting game for everybody.\u201d\n\nDenmark have become one of the stories of the tournament and have gone from strength to strength since the trauma of their opening game, when midfielder Christian Eriksen suffered a cardiac arrest.\n\nFormer Tottenham player Eriksen, who has since been discharged from hospital, scored the winner from the penalty spot the last time Denmark visited Wembley to play England in the Nations League in October 2020, as Harry Maguire was sent off.\n\nThe Danes, who lost their first two games to Finland and Belgium, have won three matches in a row to reach the semi-finals.\n\nIt is nearly three decades since the Danes shocked the continent with their victory at Euro 1992, taking advantage of a late call-up to the finals to produce their country\u2019s greatest sporting moment.\n\nThey are just two Wembley wins away from writing another fairytale.\n\n\u201cWe almost lost our best player, our best friend and the heart of the team,\u201d said Hjulmand. \u201cWe have tried to fight through these emotions and we have played fantastic football.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown who we are and I am very proud.\u201d",
