          "title": "Finally FG, doctors reach agreement",
          "text": "..To pay N4.8bn for residency training within 7-days\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nThe Federal Government and the Nigerian Medical Association, NMA, including resident doctors and other stakeholders in the medical sector yesterday reached an agreement over the 12-point demands by the doctors.\n\nRecall that the resident doctors under the umbrella of Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors, NARD, had embarked on indefinite strike on August 2 over the alleged inability of the government to meet with the association\u2019s demands.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, who is the Conciliator-in-Chief of the Federal Government had threatened to invoke the \u2018no work, no pay\u2019 policy to make the striking workers suspend the strike, but the doctors were adamant.\n\nThe development made the Minister to drag the doctors to the Industrial Court for adjudication as negotiation to resolve the industrial dispute broke down\n\nHowever, after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday, Ngige was directed to use every available means to resolve the impasse.\n\nAfter a marathon meeting that lasted about 11 hours on the instance of the Labour Minister, an agreement was reached although as at the time of filing this report, the relevant parties were yet to conclude the paper work.\n\nA source privy to the meeting said, \u201cAt close door, the meeting tackled and resolved all the 12 point issues such as payment of House Doctors where Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria tabled evidence to show that 2800 doctors have been paid and efforts ongoing to sort the outstanding 144; the N4.8 billion Residency Training Fund which the Budget Office assured would be paid in 7 days.\n\n\u201cThe arrears of the consequential adjustment of the National Minimum Wage which the meeting agreed, cuts across other sectors but that greater focus must be paid to clearing that of April to December 2019 which has no ambiguity. The Ministry of Health also revealed that as of August 3, 2021, a list from 38 hospitals has been forwarded to the Budget office for inclusion in the Service Wide Vote.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also tackled the issue of locum doctors/ emergency and migration to IPPIS, the bench fees and the hazard allowance which it agreed should be out of the negotiation table since the stalemate created by the disagreement between the NMA and JOHESU was responsible for the delay, as the Federal Government already mapped out N37.5B for it.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the National Council on Establishment, given effect by the Circular from the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation which excised house doctors and NYSC doctors from the scheme of service was also visited. Also deliberated upon was skipping which is a consequential grade alignment as well as non-payment of three months Covid-19 allowance to some doctors in 2020, and migration of MDCAN to CONUAS among others.\u201d\n\nThe meeting which had the most high-powered representation since negotiations with doctors, stretched for 11 hours, with all the consolidated 12-point demand by NARD, the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) and other affiliates of NMA resolved.\n\nIn his opening speech, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige said the President directed him to side step every technicalities and re-commence conciliation, especially in the background of the alternative dispute resolution window, provided by the National Industrial Court, where the matter was referred to under the instrument of article 17 of the Trade Disputes Act.\n\n\u201cThe National Industrial Court in its wisdom advised that NARD should keep talking with its employers. So we are tapping into this widow of an alternative dispute resolution to ameliorate this situation that is already bad,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nNgige commended the President of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) Prof. Innocent Ujah for assuming his role as the leader of all doctors in Nigeria, saying all affiliate doctors\u2019 associations are under the NMA.\n\nHe said, \u201cwhen you talk to the children and they don\u2019t listen well, you talk to their parents. The standing agreement that every negotiation by affiliate associations must be led by the NMA was not observed in the recent past. I therefore commend Ujah for assuming his role as the father of all doctors. I want you to play this role effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\nHe insisted the present administration has made more investment in the health sector, and for doctors and other health professionals than the previous administrations, and dismissed insinuations that the non-keeping of agreements by the Federal Government was the root of incessant doctors\u2019 strike.\n\nThe Minister of State for Health, Senator Olorunnimbe Mamora in his speech urged the doctors to end their strike in the interest of the nation as government tackles their demands.\n\nHowever, the President of NMA, Professor Uja said the strike was avoidable and blamed some government functionaries for not playing their roles.\n\n\u201cAs doctors, we are trained to prevent disease, cure illnesses and promote health but not trained to go on strike,\u201d and regretted that circumstances force the doctors otherwise.\n\nHe thanked Senator Ngige for going the extra miles to ensure that officers across Ministries and agencies who are relevant to tackling the doctors\u2019 demands are put on their toes.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting we had on Wednesday, before us, he was calling relevant officers, asking what have you done about this, what have you done about this? He does his own and also chases others around to ensure that progress is made,\u201d Uja said, adding there was no misunderstanding between him and the Minister as falsely reported in a section of the media.\u201d\n\nApart from Senator Ngige and Senator Mamora, others in attendance included the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Labour and Employment , Dr. Peter Tarfa, Health, Mamman Mamuda, Permanent Secretary, Service Welfare, Office of the Head of Service, Ngozi Onwudiwe, Director General of the Budget Office, Ben Akabueze, Chairman of National Salaries, Income and Wages Commission, Ekpo Nta, representative of the Minister of State, Finance, Budget and Planning, representatives of the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, leaders of the NMA, NARD, MDCAN among others.

          "text": "Chief Ayo Adebanjo\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon\n\nThe Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, on Saturday, warned that Nigeria may be drifting towards a dictatorial and tyrannical state urging the Federal Government to shun nepotism, confront insecurity and restructure the country.\n\nIn a statement by its acting Leader and National Publicity Secretary, Chief Ayo Adebanjo and Comrade Jare Ajayi, Afenifere said that it was forced into this unsavoury conclusion in view of various actions and pronouncements of the Federal Government in recent times.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe dictatorial tendency of the President can be seen in his insistence to go ahead with re-opening grazing routes and establishment of ranches in the country when the preponderance of opinions across the country is to do away with open grazing.\n\n\u201cWe vividly recall that on February 9, 2021, the 19 states\u2019 governors in the North at their meeting resolved that open grazing could no longer be sustained. They resolved to encourage herders in their areas to go into modern way of rearing cows which is ranching.\n\n\u201cOn May 11 of this same year, their counterparts in all the 17 states in the South met in Asaba, Delta state and placed a ban on open grazing. \u201cThis was backed up with legal instruments through the enactment of an enabling law as passed by the respective Houses of Assembly as shrined In Section 4 and in Part 2 of the Second Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cAlso, against the wishes of the majority of Nigerians, the President went ahead to sign the PIB into law despite the obvious injustice contained therein and to which the attention of the government was called beforehand.\n\n\u201cSame goes for the insistence on going for the non transmission of elections results electronically when doing so was what majority of Nigerians wanted and asked for.\n\nAfenifere maintained that only a government with dictatorial tendencies \u2018behave in that manner.\n\n\u201cStill on the issue of tyranny, this could be seen in how the Buhari administration is hard on those agitating for a better life for their people while it is soft on bandits, kidnappers and herders who are imperilling the lives of farmers.\n\nALSO READ: Grazing Reserves: Buhari in fool\u2019s paradise \u2014 Afenifere\n\n\u201cAfenifere regretted that on several occasions, the administration of President Buhari has taken measures that were totally against the interests of the Nigerian populace.\n\n\u201cContrary to the promises made during the electoral campaigns by the President and his party, the All Progressives Congress, the prices of commodities and services have skyrocketed while social services delivery and infrastructure kept receding.\n\n\u201cThe worst aspect of all these is the level of insecurity in the country today. At no time in the history of this Nigeria had life was so cheap and living was so precarious as they were presently. Unfortunately, those who should act are expressing their helpless as exemplified by the call of Katsina state Governor Bello Masari on the people of the state to find the means of securing themselves against bandits who have literally taken control in many parts of the state.\n\n\u201cFor sure, Masari was not the first official to make such a call. But his was very significant not only because he belongs to the same political party with the president but also because he is the governor of the President\u2019s home state.\n\n\u201cRather than confronting the challenges in various issues that have direct bearings on the life of the people, the federal government preferred to go for the less impactful things such as regulating the media, going after those who are peacefully expressing displeasure over what is going on in the country and concerning itself with where and how cows are to be grazed in the country.\n\n\u201cThis attitude on the part of President Buhari recalls to one\u2019s mind, the story of the Roman Emperor Nero who was busy on the fiddle when his empire was burning\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Buhari to redirect its administration adroitly and embrace democratic ethos immediately by pursuing only policies that are in the best interests of the people.\n\n\u201cThe only panacea to the multi various problems bedevilling the country now is for the federal government to shun nepotism, confront insecurity and Restructure the country immediately.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The Commission has just introduced the online pre-registration of eligible voters. The INEC is already pushing for electronic voting. It has taken bold steps to procure no fewer than 200,000 electronic voting machines to cater for 176,846 polling units nationwide.\n\nBy these and other proactive body language and progressive policy actions, the INEC is sending positive signals into the system that it is willing, able and ready to rise above the pressures of the ruling parties and powerful officeholders to ensure that the votes of Nigerians count.\n\nThese reforms will ensure that the process of voting and result transmission are made easier, safer, quicker and more foolproof. INEC is moving away from the past where the Commission itself, due to the interests of the governments in power, was the most reluctant to respond to the people\u2019s yearnings for reforms.\n\nThe 2023 general elections will be a great opportunity for the Commission to prove to Nigerians and the democratic world that our electoral umpire can no longer be pushed around by the powers that be.\n\nFortunately, Professor Yakubu has secured his unprecedented second five-year tenure.\n\nThe road is now clear for the Commission to give Nigerians a showpiece general election that will restore the faith of the people in the ballot box.\n\nWe look forward to a genuinely independent, highly professionalised electoral umpire which is above the pressures of incumbent governments and crooked political actors.",

          "title": "How Big Brother Africa opened doors for me \u2013 Melvin Oduah",
          "text": "By Cynthia Oyinatumba\n\nMelvin Oduah is a model-cum-actor. His popularity started when he featured in the Big Brother Africa 2014. He is one of the casts in the recent movie produced by Jim Iyke ,\u2019 Bad Comments\u2019. Talking to Sunday Sun, he went down memory lane about his journey into the world of entertainment.\n\nTell us about your journey into being an actor?\n\nFirst, I was in Gulder Ultimate Search in 2009. That was Gulder Ultimate Search 6, in Gulder Ultimate Search, I came second. Then, two years later in 2011, I went for Mr. Nigeria and I came second as well, then, two years again, (laughs) Ah! I\u2019ve paid my dues, I went for Big Brother Africa in 2014. It was a wonderful experience because that gave me my business platform I have today, it put me out there and I did my best to capitalise on that opportunity because I know where I would want to be and I\u2019m very grateful for how far I\u2019ve come, so yeah, that\u2019s my story so far. I\u2019ve struggled hard, I am working harder, I have a lot of things I am putting together, with different people right now.\n\nHave you always acted before Big Brother?\n\nI was an actor before I came to Big Brother, just that I was not as known as I am right now. You know, as someone in the entertainment industry, you look for different platforms or different ways to elevate yourself as an entertainer, so that people can see you and you can now show people what you can do and that\u2019s exactly what Big Brother Africa did for me. Before I went into the House, I was acting, I told Africa while I was in the House, how much of an actor I was, how much of a passionate actor I was , then coming out, I got producers, directors, calling me and yes, that has brought me to where I am today and I\u2019m so grateful for that.\n\nDid you do modelling job also?\n\nWell, that\u2019s why I call myself an entertainer. Asides being an actor, I call myself an entertainer, I don\u2019t just streamline, do acting alone, because I also model, yes, I\u2019m a model and I still model till tomorrow. I prepare events, I\u2019ve hosted a lot of events, from fashion shows to awards, to pageants, I host events, yes and, of course, we do celebrity appearances, guest appearances, I mean, entertainment is a very big subject, so we try as much as possible to touch on every area. It is so detailed.\n\nYou featured in the latest movie of Jim Iyke, \u2018Bad Comments\u2019?\n\nYes, I did a guest appearance in \u2018Bad comments\u2019. It was amazing, it was an amazing experience.\n\nWhich other movie have you featured in?\n\nI have done a lot of movies, but let me talk about Bad Comments if you permit me. Bad Comments is a movie, I can\u2019t wait to see how the crowd would react after watching this movie. I\u2019m not speaking as an outsider now, I\u2019m an insider because I know how this movie is because, like I said, I was a guest appearance in the movie. Now, this movie is about today\u2019s reality, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so happy, I cannot wait to see how people are going to react because, like I said, I was very impressed, I was very satisfied to see the reaction of the crowd. I personally believe that the negative impact of what trolling and cyber bullying have done to our society is underestimated, so, this shows what happens to some celebrities, not just celebrities, more of humans out there, normal people out there, people are getting depressed everyday, people are dying everyday, suicide, because of what they see on social media, so that\u2019s what happens when we see movies like this because it just shows us so that we can learn and impact this kind of thing in our everyday lives , let people to know that what people are saying about you on social media doesn\u2019t define you as a person, pray for grace to do the right thing, work hard and you\u2019ll achieve what you\u2019re meant to achieve.\n\nHave you experienced bad media before?\n\nOh yes, I have, especially when I got out of the Big Brother house in 2014. I saw a lot of things, I experienced a lot of cyber bullying, people that had opinions of me or people that feel like they have opinions about me, then the kind of things they said about me, a lot of them lies and all that. At first, it got to me because at that point I was just like not ready for all the bullying I got that time, but with time, I had to realise, I had to tell myself look, these things don\u2019t define me as a person. Like I said, pray for grace, work hard, do what you\u2019re supposed to do and God will grant you your desires. Forget about these things , if you let them get to you, the negative commentary will affect you as a person and you cannot forge ahead. So, people need to understand the social media. Social media has brought a lot of negativity into our reality, so, people need to be strong and understand that you should not let these things get to you as a person.\n\nYou don\u2019t appear in movies as you used to, why?\n\nRight from time, I\u2019ve been taught and I\u2019ve been educated not to take any script that doesn\u2019t suit you, not because this producer wants you for a movie, that you scrutinise, you go through it, you look at the production as a whole, is it something you want to do? Is it something that will make you or mar you, so yeah, that\u2019s how it has been for me working. Yes, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of movies, last month I was busy, I\u2019ve been busy throughout the whole of last month, I\u2019ve rarely had a day to myself, I\u2019ve been working back to back and I still have a couple of scripts right now that I\u2019m still about to start shooting, so yeah, it\u2019s been very good for me so far, I just thank God.\n\nIn Nollywood, female actors say that before they\u2019re given a role, the producers lure them into relationships, sex and all that, and you too, you\u2019re good looking, so, before you get a role to play, what\u2019s your own challenge?\n\nI\u2019m aware of all those things that are being said about how directors and producers will only give a particular set of people, a particular set of female and male actors roles if they do this and that. I mean, we hear all these everyday, but the good thing is that I\u2019ve never been a victim of that, every single role I\u2019ve played in every single movie have been given to me on credit and actually recommendations, and actually close auditions, even open auditions. People would tell him, oh, this guy is good, try him out and see, yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since. So, these directors and producers, they try me out, in fact, 89 per cent, if not 90 per cent of the production houses, producers, the directors I\u2019ve worked with always call me back because they enjoyed my performance in their production and that\u2019s what it has been for me, so, yes , I hear these things no doubt, but I\u2019ve just been lucky or privileged rather not to be in that scenario. So, I can\u2019t talk much about it since I\u2019ve never experienced it.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re to advise anyone who wants to go for Big Brother Naija, what would you tell them because many still believe it is not morally sound to watch?\n\n(Laughs) I went for Big Brother Africa, not Big Brother Naija.\n\nBut it\u2019s still Big Brother?\n\nIt\u2019s still Big Brother, yeah, I think people should accept the positivity that the reunion does to people than the negativity. Now, these housemates were together for a couple of weeks and now, they left. Now, the reunion was what brought them back together again for the first time since they left the house. Now, going out of the house, you hear things, a lot of negative things, \u201coh do you know what this person said about you\u201d? This and that. So, I think, the reunion should be welcomed, people should see it as an opportunity to clear the air, \u201coh okay, I heard you said this about me, really?\u201d Then the person says \u201cno, this is what I said and this is why I said that \u201c. Okay then, you guys make peace , you guys clear it out and that\u2019s it. So, I believe that was the or that is the idea in doing a reunion show. You guys, okay, we know you don\u2019t meet, you don\u2019t talk about everything, but they\u2019re bringing you guys together now, what is your grudge against us, what do you guys have against this person, say it out.\n\nYou are very fashionable, what is your type of style?\n\nIn fact, style for me is expressing yourself, the way you look, the way you dress should tell the person you are, your mood, how you feel at that point in time, so, that\u2019s how it is for me. The way I come out is the way I\u2019m feeling at that point in time. I can be so casual at some point, it means that I\u2019m in that type of mood and I can come out very fashionable at some point, it means, that kind of mood is rare, yeah , so, fashion to me is just about expressing yourself through dressing.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite music?\n\nI\u2019m an all genre kind of person. Oh, yes, if it\u2019s rock, R \u2018n\u2019 B, that is fine. You can\u2019t find me listening to one kind of music. If you see my playlist, you\u2019ll be shocked. I mean you can call me a weird because my playlist has different types of music, rock, rap, soul, old school, reggae, everything, so that\u2019s my kind of person.",

          "title": "Zone to produce Secondus successor must be strong to win elections for PDP \u2013 Ebenezer Babatope",
          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen\n\nThere is no end in sight to the controversy trailing the tenure of Prince Uche Secondus as the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In this interview, a former Minister of Transport, Ebenezer Babatope, expressed optimism that the party would come out of the raging crisis stronger than ever.\n\nYour party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is in disarray over the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC). What is your take on the scenario that is playing out?\n\nThe governors of the PDP have met and they have told the world what will happen. We are going to have a convention and Secondus will manage the party until the convention. After the convention, he leaves. That is the solution.\n\nIf he goes after the convention, which zone are you expecting to produce the next chairman from?\n\nWe are going to ensure that the zone to produce the chairman will be the zone that will be able to win victory for the party in the 2023 elections.\n\nThere is agitation for the slot in the Southwest. Are you saying that the Southwest can ensure victory for the party in the coming elections?\n\nI belong to Bode George group of the PDP. We are going to take a final decision on this matter this week. As far as I am concerned, I believe the Southwest is a winnable zone and we are prepared to ensure victory for the party.\n\nWhat about powerful big wigs like the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, who are strongly opposed to Secondus?\n\nWike was party of the governors\u2019 meeting. One would have expected him to express his opposition at the governors\u2019 meeting before Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State informed Nigerians and the world about what is going to happen sometimes in October. Secondus will manage the party till that time and then leaves. I don\u2019t think there is anything personal issue between him and Secondus. They may have disagreement, but they can\u2019t destroy the party because of the disagreement. If he agrees with what the governors have said, it will help the party to move forward and reposition it to win the 2023 elections.\n\nThe contention of those opposed to Secondus is that the party has not been well managed or positioned to win the next elections. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nI want to assure you that by the grace of God, all members of the PDP , including all Nigerians, who are concerned about what is happening in the country, will ensure the defeat of APC government in the 2023 election. And when that happens, Nigerians will see that the PDP is desirous of victory. We will do everything in our party to ensure that we have that victory.\n\nElection is not about mere wishes, it is about programmes and organization. But you know, of course, that your party has already lost some formidable forces to the APC, including three governors and members of the National Assembly. Is that not an indication that the party needs to put its acts together to be able to put up a good fight?\n\nI agree with you that we have to get our acts together so that we can put up a good fight and that is what we are doing. We are doing everything to ensure that we put our acts together so that we can have victory. The point is that party organization is not rub my back and I rub your back. It is a serious matter that involves the support of everybody to ensure the victory of the party. What is happening now is a wakeup call for all of us to rise up and support the party to win the next elections. We are very mindful of the fact that we are serving the supreme interest of the Nigerian people and everything will be done to have victory.\n\nAs you have said, you belong to Bode George Southwest faction of the PDP. Would you say that everything is well within the Southwest of the party to guarantee its victory?\n\nIn Osun State, we are ready. We cannot say we don\u2019t have problems, but all problems will be put aside. We have a Chairman in the State, Mr Sunday Bisi, who is working hard to lead the party to victory in the coming governorship election in the state. Aside from that, our candidate is Senator Ademola Adeleke and we are going to make sure that his victory will be a total victory.\n\nYou spoke about Osun State, what about the Southwest as a whole?\n\nThat is my state and they say charity begins at home. We in the Southwest are ready. We have problems, but we are going to solve that problem. Don\u2019t forget that we had Southwest zonal election where Arapaja emerged as the chairman. We are going to work with him to give us direction.\n\nFor Osun State, are you foreclosing the possibility of primary election as you have confirmed that Adeleke will be your flag bearer in the coming governorship election?\n\nI am talking about my own opinion. We have formidable people in Osun State who can effectively govern the state. We are not going to be divided over matters that are not serious. Southwest is equally as prepared as Osun State for the next elections. We are going to have election that will give us victory in the party. We are very ready to take over power from Governor Isiaka Oyetola. Everybody knows that we were robbed, daylight robbery. This time around, we are ready. I am not saying that we don\u2019t have problems, but we are going to solve those problems. And by the time we solved the problem, we will ensure victory in all elections including the national elections.\n\nHow do you see the preparation of INEC to ensure free, fair and credible elections at all levels?\n\nHonestly speaking, I cannot vouch for INEC. The mere mention of INEC by you raises fundamental fear in me. INEC is never to be trusted until they do things and we see that the things are done well.\n\nWhat is your thought about the state of the nation?\n\nMay God save our country because whether or not we like it, Nigeria belongs to all of us. We must invest in peace, security, unity and progress of the country. I am appealing to the APC to be firm in their mind that they are going to conduct free and credible elections.\n\nThe issue of credible election is far beyond making an appeal to the ruling party for a credible election. Opposition must also do its part by insisting that the right thing is done. How are you doing that?\n\nI can assure you that we will do everything in our power to ensure that we cooperate with anybody who wishes Nigeria well by having free and fair election. And that is why I am appealing to the APC because all these things they are playing by enticing the governors will divide our country. We don\u2019t need it.\n\nWith the President\u2019s assent to the PIB, there is speculation that the pump price of Petroleum may be in the region of N250 to N300. What do you have to say about this?\n\nI wish them the best of luck. But all these contradictions will add up to affirm the opinion of Nigerians that the APC government should be put aside in 2023.\n\nThe issue of state creation was again brought to the fore by the National Assembly even though they have denied it.

          "text": "By Omodele Adigun\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria, in pursuit of key role to engender confidence in the Nigerian financial system and mediate disputes between banks and customers, recently demonstrated in practical manner that \u201cjustice delayed is not justice denied\u201d when it made some banks refund N89.2 billion to customers for failed ATM transactions.\n\nThe heart-warming and laudable outcome was a fitting resolution of the petitions of 23,526 customers who lodged complaints to the apex bank in respect of failed transactions over a nine-year period, following their banks\u2019 failure to resolve their complaints.\n\nEventually, 22,173 of them got their trapped N89.2 billion refunded to them. In some sense, the initiative was a special gift to the huge number of bank customers, from the CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele who recently marked his birthday.\n\nThe deposit money banks refunded the amount to customers over various financial-related complaints from 2012 to June 2021.\n\nEmefiele reportedly disclosed this during a two-day sensitisation fair entitled: \u201cPromoting Financial Stability and Economic Development,\u201d held in Calabar, the Cross River State capital, where he was represented by Osita Nwanisobi, the CBN\u2019s spokesperson.\n\nClarifying the statement, Nwanisobi said that the fund was based on complaints from customers concerning charges and other related matters in the last nine years.\n\nJust last year, the apex bank announced that it recovered over N60 billion excess charges imposed by banks on customers and returned the money to the owners.\n\nThe CBN said that through Consumer Protection Department (CPD) that the amount was recovered following complaints by 13,000 aggrieved customers over excess and illegal charges on their accounts by banks.\n\nCPD Deputy Director, Chinyere Obilor, said that some of the banks were commensurately sanctioned for the observable unethical practices, urging the banking public to promptly report any unethical practice by commercial banks to the CBN, for what she called \u201cimmediate action.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank had said that it recovered N76.75 billion and $20.90 million for customers between 2012 and November 30, 2019, adding that the refunds were from 16,263 resolved complaints.\n\nLast year, CBN revised the timeframe for resolution of failed transactions, dispense errors or disputes and refund complaints on electronic channels.\n\nThe directives include instant reversal or within 24 hours of failed ATM transactions when customers withdraw from their own banks; not more than 48 hours reversal when customers withdraw from other bank\u2019s ATMs.\n\nAlso, CBN directed banks to resolve all failed point of sale (POS) and online/web transactions within 72 hours. For the latest recovery, the Head CPD, Daramola Atanda, advised customers to report cases of violations to the apex bank on 07002255226 or via email to this address: [email protected]\n\nUsually, some of the challenges that bank customers face are as follows: unfair or inexplicable charges, poor customer service by bank staff, unauthorised transactions on customer accounts through bank transfers or ATM withdrawals, among others.\n\nInundated with complaints from customers, the CBN has rolled out a template of fines and other sanctions against any bank engaging in illegal deductions or charges on customers\u2019 accounts or tardy work ethics leading to customer dissatisfaction.\n\nTo address the deluge of bank customers\u2019 complaints, the CBN created the Consumer Protection Department to deal with complaints by bank customers.\n\nEmefiele, therefore, called on bank customers to come forward and lodge their complaints before the Consumer Protection Department for thorough investigations and punishment of any bank found culpable.\n\n\u201cThe CBN will not take lightly to issues of overcharging of customers by banks and that is why we have issued several exposure drafts and one of them is the guide to banking charges. This is a contract between banks and their customers,\u201d he said.\n\nSteps to lodge complaint\n\nA guide by the CPD on how and where an aggrieved bank customer can lodge a complaint against financial institutions regulated by the CBN such as commercial banks, microfinance banks, primary mortgage institutions and discount houses stipulates as follows:\n\nContact your institution first:\n\nThe CBN issued a circular in 2011 directing all banks to expand their existing ATM Help Desk to handle all types of consumer complaints. Therefore, if you have a complaint against your bank, you must first report the complaint at the bank/branch where the issue originated and then allow two weeks (it might be less in some banks) for the issue to be resolved.\n\nWhat to do when the bank fails to resolve your complaint:\n\nIf after lodging your complaint your bank still fails to engage you and resolve the complaint within two weeks as provided for in the ATM Help Desk Circular, you have the right to escalate your complaint to the Consumer Protection Department (CPD) of the CBN.\n\nComplain to Consumer Protection Department:\n\nIf the bank fails to resolve your complaint within the two weeks given by the CBN, you can direct your complaints to CPD. To contact the CPD, you are required to do so the through the following channels: by email to the address [email protected] or send a letter to this address \u2013 The Director, Consumer Protection Department, Central Business District, Abuja, which can be submitted at the CBN Head Office or at any of the branches of CBN nationwide..\n\nIt is necessary to understand that the CPD of the CBN deals with all financial-related complaints so far as such complaints are against financial institutions within its regulatory purview.\n\nTo assist members of the public in obtaining redress, it is important that complaint letters are written in an effective manner. In other words, the complaint should be clear and concise to avoid ambiguity. The complaint letter (petition) should contain the following information amongst other things: name, address, contact phone number & e-mail of the complainant; name of your financial institution; personal banking details (do not include PIN & Passwords, please;) history/date of the transaction in dispute; amount claimed (if any); attach relevant documents to support your claim and; evidence to show that you have first lodged the complaint at your bank.\n\nYou can make further inquiries and obtain additional information on the complaints handling process of the CBN from the Complaints Unit of your bank/financial institution or from CBN offices nationwide.",

Adetunji Idowu Olurin.\n\nIn a statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said he joined family, friends and professional colleagues in mourning the military officer, who served the country meritoriously in his career.\n\nRecalling his service in various capacities to the nation, Buhari described Olurin as an outstanding ECOMOG Commander in Liberia.\n\nThe President prayed the Almighty God to grant the departed soul eternal rest, and comfort his family.\n\nSimilarly, Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, in a condolence message by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, expressed shock over the news of the death of Olurin, whom he described as a gallant military officer and astute administrator.\n\nAbiodun said the death of the former civilian administrator of Ekiti State occurred at a time the country and Ogun State needed his security expertise in tackling various security challenges confronting the nation.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of my family and the people of Ogun State, I commiserate with the entire Olurin Family of Ilaro. The demise of one of Nigeria\u2019s finest military officers is a painful loss to our state and the country,\u201d Abiodun stated.\n\nHis counterpart in Oyo State, Governor Seyi Makinde, while condoling with the family, described the late former MILAD as \u201cone of the past administrators who shaped our great state.\u201d\n\nA statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, said Governor Makinde commiserated with the Governor of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun, the people of Ogun State and the Olurin family.\n\nHe said: \u201cI learnt of the death of the former Military Administrator of Oyo State, General \u2018Tunji Idowu Olurin. It is sunset for another great man and one of the first set of leaders that providence gave to Oyo State at its earliest stage.\n\n\u201cThrough the efforts and contributions of Gen. Olurin and other leaders, the foundation for the shaping of the Pacesetter State, which has become a first among equals, was successfully laid.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in a condolence message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, described the late Olurin as a committed officer and elder statesman who served his country passionately.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cOn behalf of the Government and people of Lagos State, I want to express my sincere and heartfelt sympathy to the family, friends and associates of the late Brigadier-General Adetunji Olurin (rtd) as well as the Nigerian Army, Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun and the entire people of the State.\n\n\u201cHe made lots of positive impact and contributions to governance during his lifetime, first as a Military Governor of Oyo State between September 1985 and July 1988 and later as Sole Administrator of Ekiti State between October 19, 2006 and April 27, 2007.\n\n\u201cI pray that God will grant Brigadier-General Adetunji Olurin (rtd) eternal rest and give the immediate family, friends, Nigerian Army and the people of Ilaro and Ogun State the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\u201d\n\nAlso, the former governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel, Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Solomon Adeola and the Chairman, Board of Directors, Ogun Guandong Free Trade Zone, Gboyega Nasir Isiaka, expressed shock over the demise of General Olurin.\n\nDaniel, in a statement he personally signed, described the late General as eminent statesman and disciplined officer who served Nigeria and Ogun with grace and candour.\n\nSenator Adeola in a statement made available to newsmen in Abeokuta by his Media Adviser, Kayode Odunaro, said the passing of the famous army general was as a huge loss not only to his people in Ilaro, Yewaland and Ogun state, but indeed a great loss to Nigeria and the international community.\n\n\u201cGeneral Olurin was a true patriot, a nationalist that sacrificed much not only for the unity of Nigeria but peace and security in the West African sub-region and African continent. His expertise in security and administration will be sorely missed\u201d, the senator stated.\n\nIn his own condolence message, Isiaka noted that the late Olurin devouted his life to the service of humanity.\n\n\u201cHe was a consummate military officer whose intervention in crucial national assignments, left indelible landmarks. Baba was also a seasoned administrator who did creditably well when called to serve as a Military Governor and later in life as Sole Administrator, Isiaka said.",

          "text": "*Says stories of planning to recruit them into Army false, demoralising\n\n*Nigeria getting closer to an agreement with Twitter\n\nCharles Ajunwa\n\nThe federal government yesterday said the demand by some Nigerians for the prosecution of repentant Boko Haram fighters rather than granting them amnesty, was against global best practices, and that it would not accept such call.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed stated this yesterday in Washington, U.S.A., during his engagement with global media outlets, think-tanks and influencers.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cI personally spoke to the military authority before I left Nigeria and they said what they were doing was what the global practice dictates about soldiers that surrendered; that they should be treated as prisoners of war.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just shoot them because there are international conventions that give rights also to prisoners of war. What the military is doing is that, when they surrender, they profile them to ensure that they are genuine and reintegrate them into the society,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed also said government will not recruit the repentant Boko Haram fighters, who have been surrendering to the military, into the Nigerian Army as being rumoured in some quarters.\n\nThe minister described the claim as \u201cfalse and demoralising\u201d, adding: \u201cfifth columnists and naysayers to stop spewing negative and false narratives around Boko Haram members who are surrendering in droves in the North-East.\u201d\n\nHe said it was unfortunate and inconceivable that some Nigerians would be going about such fake news.\n\nNo fewer than 1,000 Boko Haram fighters and their families had handed themselves over to Army units in recent weeks in the southern Borno towns of Konduga, Bama, and Mafa.\n\nThe minister also berated those alleging that the surrendered insurgents were not actual Boko Haram fighters and that if they were, they should be shot rather than granted amnesty.\n\nMohammed said rather than changing the narratives, President Muhammadu Buhari and the military should be respectfully commended for their resourcefulness and doggedness respectively, in the fight against insurgency.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe fact that we are witnessing insurgents submitting in droves calls for commendation of our military for their doggedness.\n\n\u201cWe must not forget that two months ago, Nigerians were putting pressure on the President to recruit mercenaries to fight the war against terror because they said we were losing the war.\n\n\u201cThe President, however, remained focused and confident in his belief in the Nigerian military that they have what it takes to defeat the insurgents. We thank God that Mr. President today has been proven right.\n\n\u201cWe were able to achieve this, largely because of the leadership of Mr. President in providing the wherewithal continually to the military and ensuring that their fighting morale is sustained by way of welfare packages.\u201d\n\nMohammed also said that the situation in Afghanistan was not the same as in Nigeria because there was no time in Nigeria that the military had engaged repentant militants.\n\nFor those yet to surrendered, the minister said the military would not rest on its oars but continue to pursue Boko Haram and ISWAP members until they could no longer be harmful to Nigerians.\n\nFG Getting Closer to an Agreement with Twitter\n\nIn a related development, the federal government says Twitter has agreed to seven out of the 10 demands it made to lift the suspension on the social media platform in Nigeria.\n\nThe Information Minister also disclosed this yesterday during his engagement with global media outlets, think-tanks and influencers.\n\nThe government on June 4 announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe government had said the reason for the suspension was because of the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cWe believe that even the other three outstanding demands, are not really about whether they agreed or not but about timing and scheduling,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThat is what gave me the confidence that we are getting nearer to an agreement. As recently as last week, we exchanged correspondence with Twitter, and when I left home a few days ago, we were expecting a reply from them.\n\n\u201cIt is left with Twitter to respond to grey areas that we asked them to look into. We are not inflexible in our negotiation with Twitter because we recognise both the positive and negative aspects of the social media.\u201d\n\nThe minister said, among the demands made to Twitter, was for the platform to register as a Nigerian company, pay taxes from revenue made from the country and ensure that harmful contents were regulated.\n\nHe said the Twitter ban was effective in the country because less harmful contents had been seen on social media since then.\n\nAccording to him, other social media platforms have also been more conscious and alert to injurious contents likely to threaten national security.\n\nThe minister added that from the talks with Twitter, when the platform resumes operations in the country, it would not be business as usual.\n\n\u2018Terrorism Has No Boundary\u2019\n\nAt another forum in Germany yesterday with global media outlets, think tanks and influencers, the Minister of Information declared that terrorism had no boundary and that no part of the world is safe if it is allowed to thrive.\n\nHe underscored the need for the developed world to see terrorism as a global threat, saying: \u201cTerrorism is global and has no boundary. For the world to be saved, every corner of the world must be saved.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cWe can see from the example of the US, where Taliban takes over Afghanistan, a pointer to how difficult it is to fight terrorism driven by ideology.\n\n\u201cThe western world should look into helping developing nations like Nigeria in developing their infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis will help to create employment and quality livelihood that will make it difficult for an ideological group like Boko Haram to recruit the youths.\u201d\n\nThe minister called for the support of the US and other countries in Nigeria\u2019s fight against the Boko Haram, adding that global support would go a long way in stamping out the menace.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Bichi is a subset of the entire Kano State, look at the economy and the activities that have happened in Bichi today by virtue of Mr. President\u2019s son\u2019s wedding to Sarkin Bichi\u2019s daughter. So if we can look beyond this country to foster unity, all the governors are here, from even different parties, PDP governors are here, APC governors came.

          "text": "*Mele Kyari: It\u2019s huge victory for Nigeria, NPDC will use it to bolster production\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has hailed the recent Appeal Court judgment affirming its ownership of the Oil Mining License 11 (OML 11), describing it as a huge victory for Nigeria and the beginning of moves to address decades of restiveness in the host community.\n\nOML 11 is in Ogoniland, Rivers State, South-eastern Niger Delta and contains 33 oil and gas fields.\n\nThe Appeal Court sitting in Abuja had on Monday upturned the August 23, 2019 ruling of the Federal High Court, Abuja which held that the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) was entitled to the renewal of the lease on OML 11.\n\nIn the ruling, the Appellate Court held that the minister of petroleum resources \u201chas the discretion whether or not to renew the OML 11 Lease in favour of SPDC.\u201d\n\nThe Court further held that the Minister rightly exercised his discretion in awarding the OML 11 Lease to NPDC, a subsidiary of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of the NNPC, Garba Deen Muhammad, quoted the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, as saying \u201cthe ruling has paved the way for the NPDC to lead a formidable OML 11 team towards bolstering productivity in a responsible, efficient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nKyari adds: \u201cAccordingly, resumption of operations on OML 11 will demonstrate the NPDC\u2019s full commitment to develop and add value to its communities and the nation as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe now have an opportunity to reconstruct a new beginning on OML 11, driven by global best practices and a social contract that would put the people and environment of the Niger Delta above pecuniary considerations.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for the government and people of Nigeria as we now have the impetus to responsibly unlock the oil and gas reserves the block offers for the benefit of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe statement further explained that efforts by the NPDC to take over the assets and operations were in full gear, adding that the company \u201cis working closely with all stakeholders and partners to achieve the new vision of responsible, smart engineering and environmental sustainability that the federal government has endorsed for OML 11.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC GMD stated that the NPDC \u201cwill pursue promotion of clean energy via its gas production with prospects of gas-to-power initiatives to light up opportunities in the region,\u201d and provide the much deserved industrialization.\n\nThe statement noted that the environment would be a top priority for NPDC\u2019s operations, as well as implementation of a robust host community engagement strategy to address subsisting issues, while agreeing to a transparent engagement model going forward.\n\nThe NNPC cautioned against any further legal challenge by the SPDC, stressing that it was about time Nigeria derived the benefit of the OML11 after over three decades.\n\n\u201cIt is time to roll back the decades of despair and destruction with the emphatic Appeal Court ruling. It is time to unlock opportunities for economic development in the region.\n\n\u201cIn the light of their inability to work on the Ogoni region of the block for over 30 years and the new beginning this judgement presents, further legal action by Shell will not only be futile, it would be depriving Nigeria of an opportunity to make meaningful gains from OML 11 when the nation needs all the revenue it can get to move Nigeria forward,\u201d the GMD said.\n\nThe NNPC, the NPDC is now set to begin oil production activities at OML 11, after years of dispute over the asset.\n\nThough, a Joint Venture (JV), Shell had not produced a drop of crude oil from Ogoniland for several years and that partners were not earning revenue as a result of the development.\n\nIn 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the NNPC, through the NPDC to take over the operatorship of the asset from SPDC.\n\nAt the time, a letter signed by the late Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, urged the national oil company to take charge not later than April 30, 2019 \u201cand ensure smooth re-entry given the delicate situation in Ogoniland.\u201d\n\nOML 11 remains one of the most important oil blocks in Nigeria. Located in a swampy terrain, it has Port Harcourt in the northwest of the block, while the major yard and logistics base at Onne is sited by the Bonny River.\n\nWhile the NNPC will take over the operatorship of the facility, it was however learnt that it will not affect the joint ownership arrangement of the block by four partners.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A Nollywood actress and human rights\u2019 activist, Chioma Ifemeludike, has disclosed that the Senior Pastor and General Overseer, Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman, paid her over N500,000 and had sex with her.\n\nThe actress and producer, who has been in the Nollywood industry for nine years, revealed that she had no idea that the man of God was quite prominent at the time she had an intercourse with him.\n\nChioma on her Instagram page recalled that the first deal of her encounter of romp sex with the man of God was sealed through a hookup by another lady, Linda Clems, noting that at the second time, she clearly recognised him because they exchanged numbers during the first romp and communicated thereafter.\n\nShe said, \u201cDear @lyndaclems, I have to tell the world about that hookup you arranged between @johnson_suleman_official and myself on the 20th November 2016 in a hotel at Ikeja, the Apostle secretly gave me his number and we had a second meeting at Oriental Hotels Lagos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry my conscience can\u2019t hold it anymore. I encourage you to tell the truth as a mother and a Christian, to put the devil to shame and save millions of souls being misled. To my family and friends, I am sorry, don\u2019t judge me. Please pray for me so the light of God will continue to expose every work of darkness in my life and the church of God.\u201d\n\nIn a video obtained by SaharaReporters, Chioma noted that her public confession came after her spirit continued to torment her, and she needed to make restitution for her sin.\n\nWATCH: I Slept With @ApostleSuleman Twice and He paid Me N500k For Hookups \u00e2\u0080\u0094Nollywood Actress, Chioma Ifemeludike Opens Up On 'Tormenting Experience' With Pastor At Oriental Hotel In Lagos\n\n\n\nFULL VIDEO: https://t.co/eSrTgw8giE \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) August 21, 2021\n\n\u201cGood morning Nigerians. I have a confession. On the 20th of November 2016, Linda made an arrangement for me to come to Ikeja and that we're going to meet her sister's friend, and a family friend going to America.\n\n\"That was what she told me. Okay, so it was supposed to be a hookup. But it wasn't really exactly put like that. Well, she told me that a family friend of hers wanted to meet someone nice and cool. And that he was going to America that same night and that he wasn't going to waste much time and he wanted me to meet that person. And I said fine.\n\n\u201c2016 was immediately after my graduation from Anambra State University, I was preparing for my youth service,\u201d she stated.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported in February 2021 that a former pastor of the Omega Fire Ministries, Mike Davids, accused Suleman, of sleeping with his wife.\n\nHe had added he was ready to expose the truths behind Stephanie Otobo\u2019s sex scandal.\n\nThe case of Otobo, a Canada-based singer, came up in 2017 and 2018 when she accused Suleman of sexual relationship \u2013 a controversial scandal that plagued the church and attracted the attention of Nigerians for months.\n\nDavids in a video had noted that he and Suleman both knew how they got Otobo to come to the church in Auchi, and apologise over the scandal and how they persuaded her mother too. Davids had accused Suleman of sleeping with his wife, Faith Edeko, who currently heads an Abuja branch of the church.\n\nHe had said, \u201cI left the church (Omega Fire Ministries) of my freewill. You were never the one who sent me out of that ministry. I was tired of your ungodliness as a leader. And that was the major reason I left that ministry. So, forget those manipulations and cheap lies.\n\n\u201cWe all know the part I played in the Stephanie Otobo saga. You know as much as I do. How much involved I was in bringing that saga to a halt. I don\u2019t even need to mention names.

          "text": "National Assembly members are bracing for a face-off with their principal officers after finding out they had been grossly cheated in the sharing of a multimillion-dollar bribe to ensure the passage of the new Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nThree senators and two House members confirmed to The Peoples Gazette following an initial tip-off that least $10 million was paid in cash to the federal lawmakers to help accelerate the passage of the bill despite pervasive opposition to a clause that granted only three percent of upstream oil companies\u2019 operating income to host communities.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamiala, Senate President Ahmad Lawan\n\nSpecifically, the newspaper reported that the lawmakers are fuming over what one of them termed as \u201cgreedy misconduct\u201d of Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamiala, who were accused of taking $2 million each in cash bribes to push the bill through despite protests from host communities.\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported earlier today (Friday) that the chief pricinpal lawmaker in the Upper Chamber, Lawan and his counterpart in the Lower Chamber, Gbajabiamila were paid in dollars (millions of naira) to guarantee the passage of the controversial Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSee Also Corruption EXPOSED: Dollar Bribes Received By Nigeria's Senate President, Lawan, House Speaker Gbajabiamila, Other Lawmakers To Pass Controversial Petroleum Bill\n\nA top source told SaharaReporters that other federal lawmakers \u2013senators and House of Representatives' members \u2013also received bribes in dollars to ensure the passage of the bill.\n\n\"Lawan was paid $2 million (N823 million) while Gbajabiamila was paid $1.5 million (N617 million) as bribes,\" the source said.\n\nThe payment of the monies was said to have been facilitated by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva.\n\n\"Each senator was paid $20, 000 (N8.2 million) while members of the lower chamber (House of Representatives) were paid $5, 000 (N2 million) each,\" the source added.\n\nHowever, the newspaper revealed that a Nigerian billionaire, probably of the largest contemporary stake in the oil and gas industry was said to have provided $2 million alone.\n\nOther firms and individuals in the oil and gas industry provided the remaining $8 million. The Gazette could not publicly identify the Billionaire.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President received $2 million and the Speaker received $2 million. Their greedy misconduct was recently exposed to us and we will seriously take up the matter when we resume from the annual recess next month,\u201d a senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid charges of breach of privilege, said.\n\n\u201cFrom what I can volunteer, many senators were given $20,000 before and after the PIB was passed, depending on their availability,\u201d the senator said.\n\nAnother lawmaker furious about the affair admitted to The Gazette that he received $5,000, but said he didn\u2019t know it was part of a multimillion-dollar payout to lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nThe lawmaker said, \u201cThey gave me $5,000 and said it was for us to buy biscuits for our children for labouring day and night to get the bill to the stage of passage,\u201d the lawmaker said under anonymity. \u201cTo God, I did not know that it was about $10 million that they received and some crooks calling themselves leaders got $2 million each for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe will protest the matter after our break because some people have to realise that they don\u2019t have two heads and we have to fight for our rights and privileges as members of the National Assembly,\u201d the lawmaker added. \u201cEach one of us is representing a constituency and that makes us all equal because no one at the National Assembly is representing more than one constituency.\u201d\n\nHost communities, largely of the oil-rich Niger-Delta region, had criticised that 3% is inadequate to address decaded of environmental degradation and neglect inflicted on traditional settlers. The communities said they would accept at least 10 per cent, even though the administration initially proposed five per cent.\n\nBut the state-operated Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and other operators dug their heels in, saying any sharing formular that offers more than 3% to host communities will cut too deep into their revenue margins and drive away potential investors in the country\u2019s wobbling oil sector.\n\nNotwitthsatnding the standoff at rowdy and inconclusive sessions at the Chambers, lawmakers last month finally passed the Petroleum Industry Bill that sought to repackage the sector and restructure the NNPC as a commercial enterprise rather than a federal charter. Buhari signed the bill into law this week despite the controversies surrounding the meagre three per cent equity stake for host communities.\n\nIt was learnt that lawmakers accepted cash inducements to pass the bill, which was proposed by Buhari\u2019s government. Lawmakers said the cash logistics was coordinated by state petroleum minister Timipre Sylva and Senator Albert Akpan (PDP-Akwa Ibom).\n\nA senator revealed to The Gazette that Mr Akpan sent one of his aides to deliver $20,000 to him at his office.\n\n\u201cHe (Mr Akpan) sent a woman from his office to give me $20,000. They said the money came from people who have investments in the oil and gas and they wanted to appreciate us for our dedication in seeing the bill through after so many years of failed efforts,\u201d the senator said.\n\nAnother lawmaker who confirmed the bribery said it was a serious scandal waiting to explode because a lawmaker had already mentioned the matter in the House' WhatsApp group weeks ago.\n\n\u201cA lawmaker protested the sharing formula but no one responded or engaged him in the House' WhatsApp group,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cSo I fear that many colleagues are angry about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nA lawmaker said the unrest could easily have been avoided had the leaders properly conducted themselves in handling the largesse.\n\n\u201cIt is common across the world for lawmakers to be offered gratification,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cBut it has to be equitably distributed so that no one feels cheated or left out.\u201d",

          "text": "National Assembly members are bracing for a face-off with their principal officers after finding out they had been grossly cheated in the sharing of a multimillion-dollar bribe to ensure the passage of the new Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nThree senators and two House members confirmed to The Peoples Gazette following an initial tip-off that least $10 million was paid in cash to the federal lawmakers to help accelerate the passage of the bill despite pervasive opposition to a clause that granted only three percent of upstream oil companies\u2019 operating income to host communities.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamiala, Senate President Ahmad Lawan\n\nSpecifically, the newspaper reported that the lawmakers are fuming over what one of them termed as \u201cgreedy misconduct\u201d of Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamiala, who were accused of taking $2 million each in cash bribes to push the bill through despite protests from host communities.\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported earlier today (Friday) that the chief pricinpal lawmaker in the Upper Chamber, Lawan and his counterpart in the Lower Chamber, Gbajabiamila were paid in dollars (millions of naira) to guarantee the passage of the controversial Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSee Also Corruption EXPOSED: Dollar Bribes Received By Nigeria's Senate President, Lawan, House Speaker Gbajabiamila, Other Lawmakers To Pass Controversial Petroleum Bill\n\nA top source told SaharaReporters that other federal lawmakers \u2013senators and House of Representatives' members \u2013also received bribes in dollars to ensure the passage of the bill.\n\n\"Lawan was paid $2 million (N823 million) while Gbajabiamila was paid $1.5 million (N617 million) as bribes,\" the source said.\n\nThe payment of the monies was said to have been facilitated by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva.\n\n\"Each senator was paid $20, 000 (N8.2 million) while members of the lower chamber (House of Representatives) were paid $5, 000 (N2 million) each,\" the source added.\n\nHowever, the newspaper revealed that a Nigerian billionaire, probably of the largest contemporary stake in the oil and gas industry was said to have provided $2 million alone.\n\nOther firms and individuals in the oil and gas industry provided the remaining $8 million. The Gazette could not publicly identify the Billionaire.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President received $2 million and the Speaker received $2 million. Their greedy misconduct was recently exposed to us and we will seriously take up the matter when we resume from the annual recess next month,\u201d a senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid charges of breach of privilege, said.\n\n\u201cFrom what I can volunteer, many senators were given $20,000 before and after the PIB was passed, depending on their availability,\u201d the senator said.\n\nAnother lawmaker furious about the affair admitted to The Gazette that he received $5,000, but said he didn\u2019t know it was part of a multimillion-dollar payout to lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nThe lawmaker said, \u201cThey gave me $5,000 and said it was for us to buy biscuits for our children for labouring day and night to get the bill to the stage of passage,\u201d the lawmaker said under anonymity. \u201cTo God, I did not know that it was about $10 million that they received and some crooks calling themselves leaders got $2 million each for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe will protest the matter after our break because some people have to realise that they don\u2019t have two heads and we have to fight for our rights and privileges as members of the National Assembly,\u201d the lawmaker added. \u201cEach one of us is representing a constituency and that makes us all equal because no one at the National Assembly is representing more than one constituency.\u201d\n\nHost communities, largely of the oil-rich Niger-Delta region, had criticised that 3% is inadequate to address decaded of environmental degradation and neglect inflicted on traditional settlers. The communities said they would accept at least 10 per cent, even though the administration initially proposed five per cent.\n\nBut the state-operated Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and other operators dug their heels in, saying any sharing formular that offers more than 3% to host communities will cut too deep into their revenue margins and drive away potential investors in the country\u2019s wobbling oil sector.\n\nNotwitthsatnding the standoff at rowdy and inconclusive sessions at the Chambers, lawmakers last month finally passed the Petroleum Industry Bill that sought to repackage the sector and restructure the NNPC as a commercial enterprise rather than a federal charter. Buhari signed the bill into law this week despite the controversies surrounding the meagre three per cent equity stake for host communities.\n\nIt was learnt that lawmakers accepted cash inducements to pass the bill, which was proposed by Buhari\u2019s government. Lawmakers said the cash logistics was coordinated by state petroleum minister Timipre Sylva and Senator Albert Akpan (PDP-Akwa Ibom).\n\nA senator revealed to The Gazette that Mr Akpan sent one of his aides to deliver $20,000 to him at his office.\n\n\u201cHe (Mr Akpan) sent a woman from his office to give me $20,000. They said the money came from people who have investments in the oil and gas and they wanted to appreciate us for our dedication in seeing the bill through after so many years of failed efforts,\u201d the senator said.\n\nAnother lawmaker who confirmed the bribery said it was a serious scandal waiting to explode because a lawmaker had already mentioned the matter in the House' WhatsApp group weeks ago.\n\n\u201cA lawmaker protested the sharing formula but no one responded or engaged him in the House' WhatsApp group,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cSo I fear that many colleagues are angry about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nA lawmaker said the unrest could easily have been avoided had the leaders properly conducted themselves in handling the largesse.\n\n\u201cIt is common across the world for lawmakers to be offered gratification,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cBut it has to be equitably distributed so that no one feels cheated or left out.\u201d",

          "text": "Have you heard the news? The Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) signed by President Muhammadu Buhari is the most anti-Niger Delta legislation in history, conceived and designed to further exploit the oil-producing region in favour of the north. How can PIA allocate a mere 3% to host communities while giving a whopping 30% of the profit of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to frontier exploration which is absolutely in favour of the north? This amounts to further stealing the resources of the traumatised people of Niger Delta. In fact, Niger Delta militants should start bombing pipelines again to fight this grave injustice and total disrespect for the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe this, I will not blame you that much. You are probably a victim of misinformation. In my study of media-based agitations over the last two decades, what I found out \u2014 and quite intriguingly \u2014 is that most of those who make initial comments on a national issue and stir long-lasting controversies often have two things in common: ignorance and mischief. They deploy these two disabilities to create and shape public debate. People begin to parrot them without cross-checking. The \u201calternative fact\u201d becomes the established \u201ctruth\u201d \u2014 no matter the corrections and rebuttals thereafter. People often succeed mainly because they play on our divisions and emotions.\n\nThe hysteria around the PIA started with the mischievous comparison between the allocations to the trust fund for host communities and the frontier exploration. In logic, this is called \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d. The 3% from the operational expenditure (OPEX) of oil companies will go directly to the host communities. The 30% for frontier basin is to be set aside by the NNPC from its \u201cprofit oil and profit gas\u201d for oil exploration across Nigeria \u2014 to increase our reserves. How are these two the same? One goes directly to communities from oil companies. The other does not go to any community. It is for the NNPC to spend on prospecting for oil for the benefit of the whole country.\n\nTwo, what the PIA says is that 30% of NNPC\u2019s \u201cprofit oil and profit gas\u201d should go into frontier exploration. Some have clandestinely changed \u201cprofit oil and profit gas\u201d to \u201cprofit\u201d. \u201cProfit oil and profit gas\u201d is NNPC\u2019s share of the profit from its production sharing contracts (PSCs) after the contractor \u2014 the provider of finance and expertise \u2014 has taken the bulk. In 2019, \u201cprofit oil and profit gas\u201d contributed just 2% of total revenue from oil, according to a NEITI report. Others were: sale of equity crude, 30.4%; petroleum profit tax, 19%; sale of royalty oil, 13%; sale of domestic crude, 7.85%; VAT, 3.5%; corporate tax, 3.4%; signature bonus, 2.7%; and NLNG dividend, 2.68%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTotal revenue from the sector in 2019 was $34.2 billion. \u201cProfit oil and profit gas\u201d accounted for just 0.6% of that in 2019. What we are preparing to go to war over now is 30% of the 0.6% revenue from profit oil and profit gas. In naira terms, about N60 billion will be set aside by NNPC yearly for frontier exploration \u2014 compared to the estimated $500 million (over N200 billion) that will go to the host communities from the annual OPEX of oil companies under PIA. Please compare and contrast. Ironically, NNPC already budgets N50 billion annually for frontier exploration in the Chad basin. PIA has now extended the fund to the Anambra, Dahomey, Bida, Sokoto and Benue troughs. Phew!\n\nThree, even if we say it is 30% of \u201cprofit\u201d (which is untrue), does NNPC make profit? What is 30% of zero? My math is atrocious, but 30% of nothing will be equal to nothing any day. Conversely, 3% of OPEX is a sure banker: it will be built into the annual budgets of the oil companies, NNPC inclusive. The oil companies already devote 3% of their annual budgets to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as required by law. So, this is another 3% charge on the companies. Based on the budget for OPEX by oil companies for 2021, the communities will have a provision of, give or take, $500 million yearly. This never existed before the PIA. And this is what is called gross injustice.\n\nFour, when you add the $500 million to what already goes to oil-producing areas through 13 per cent derivation, Ministry of Niger Delta, NDDC and Amnesty Programme, you really need to search elsewhere for the injustice these critics are talking about. The N200 billion to host communities is an entirely new stream of income to the oil-producing areas since we found oil in 1956. And there is even more: the PIA provides that the host communities will share from the gas flare penalties. That is roughly another N130 billion in the kitty! Yet, the PIA is gross injustice. That is why if I had my way, I would hand over the entire oil revenue to the Niger Delta, hoping it would finally bring peace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive, \u201cfrontier exploration\u201d is being framed as \u201cnorthern exploration\u201d. Those pushing this line and creating a false equivalence with the host fund actually think they are fighting the north. Unfortunately, there are frontier basins elsewhere. The frontier fund is for oil exploration outside the Niger Delta. We have the Anambra, Benue and Dahomey troughs which cut across southern and middle belt states such as Benue, Taraba, Enugu, Ebonyi, Anambra, Lagos, Ogun and Ondo, etc. The PIA has clearly extended frontier exploration to all the troughs in the country. Why not monitor, instead, to make sure southern states benefit from the fund? Isn\u2019t that more reasonable?\n\nSix, let us even say the frontier exploration fund is only for the north (which is untrue). The sense I have been getting from some outspoken southern leaders, at least from reading newspapers, is that they do not want to be in the same country with northerners. They say northerners are parasites and beggars. In that case, why not encourage them to prospect for oil in their own region so that they can leave your oil for you? Why should you be angry or afraid that oil may be found up north? You want only your region to have oil so that you can continue to belittle others as parasites? Really? This is what the Yoruba call the spirit of \u201ckenimani\u201d (wishing others will not prosper like you).\n\nWhat I find most troubling is that it appears we have been programmed in Nigeria to see and amplify the worst of things. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) had been gathering dust on the shelves of the national assembly since 2008. The original idea was to create an omnibus and contemporary law to govern the oil industry. In 2000, President Olusegun Obasanjo set up the Dr Emmanuel Egbogah-led Oil and Gas Implementation Committee (OGIC) for this purpose. Egbogah, now of blessed memory, was one of the most respected experts in the oil industry globally. The work of OGIC gave birth to the PIB, which was first sent to the national legislature in 2008 by President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nBedevilled by intrigues (including the absurd claim in 2012 that fake versions were being circulated among the federal lawmakers), the PIB remained a dream. Now that we have finally crossed the finish line, the first wave of reaction has been so predictable: condemnation, laced with threats. Of course, the Buhari administration has done a poor job in the area of communication. (Lai Mohammed, the information minister, is only interested in bullying the social media.) That governors are issuing press statements to air their reservations over the PIA says a lot about how this administration communicates with the key stakeholders. Victory is gradually turning to defeat!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStates have legitimate reasons to be worried over the PIA. The frontier exploration fund will affect FAAC. The host community fund will also affect FAAC. At a time of dwindling revenues, everyone, including the federal government, has reasons to worry. Every little kobo will impact on federation allocation. But we have to see this as a matter of trade-off: more revenue to communities and less to FAAC, more revenue for investment in exploration and less money to FAAC \u2014 but the \u201closses\u201d are balanced with peace in the host communities and the benefit of investing in frontier exploration today so that we can have more revenue to share tomorrow. This should be seen as a win-win.\n\nFor full disclosure, I am a \u201cpetro-sceptic\u201d. I hold the position that oil wealth has done extensive damage to Nigeria and Nigerians. I am one of those who theorise that the hydrocarbon has ruined or retarded Nigeria\u2019s human, economic and political development in the last 45 years. I am of the view that the petrodollar has led to poor governance and fuelled corruption and conflict. I believe we would have attained real development if we had not enjoyed oil boom and had continued on our path of agriculture and industrialisation as it was in the 1950s and 60s. I believe the boom-bust cycle of oil has derailed our development trajectory and thrown us into a chronic cyclical economic crisis.\n\nNevertheless, I cannot deceive myself by trying to run away from the fact that the petrodollar remains the backbone of Nigeria\u2019s public finance and the supplier of most of the forex. We cannot deny that. Therefore, when you realise the amount of investments Nigeria has lost over the years because of the uncertainty over the PIB, you would appreciate why passing the legislation is a milestone worth celebrating. According to Buhari, Nigeria lost $50 billion worth of investments in the past 10 years to the uncertainty. If this economy can receive such investments in the next 10 years, assuming things go well, there is no way we won\u2019t feel some positive impact.\n\nI understand that people must play politics. I also understand that part of playing politics in Nigeria is to raise the stakes to take as much as you can get from the system. The oil communities have every right to try to hold on tightly to their natural resources. It is their luck that there is plenty hydrocarbon in the bellies of their earth. Left to me, they can keep all the revenue. Nobody will die. Many countries don\u2019t have oil. However, in all these agitations, we should appreciate progress. From zero naira to N200 billion is progress in my books. We should also not stop other parts of Nigeria from exploring for more oil. And, above all, let us stick to the facts and stop the mischief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nROAD TAX\n\nThe story is told of a student who exploited his illiterate parents by saying his teacher asked him to buy three books: Dic, Tion and Ary. He simply broke dictionary into three! The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is about to pull a fast one on Nigerians by seeking to institute \u201croad tax\u201d \u2014the permit to put your vehicle on the road. It is the same thing as the \u201cvehicle licence\u201d that we already pay for in Nigeria. It is called \u201croad tax\u201d in the UK. Somebody from FIRS obviously travelled to the UK and thought he had made a big discovery. If we don\u2019t rise up against the proposed tax, FIRS will succeed in making monkeys out of all Nigerians. And toll gates are about to return. Crafty.\n\nMANTLE OF DEMOCRACY\n\nWhen former deputy senate president, Alhaji Ibrahim Mantu, died at the age of 74 on Tuesday from COVID-19 complications, my mind went back to the third term plot of President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2006. Mantu was at the forefront. I was very critical of him. It was only recently we got to know, through Chief Orji Uzor Kalu\u2019s memoir, that Mantu was actually working against it. If indeed this is true, then Mantu deserves to be regarded as a hero of our democracy. If Obasanjo had succeeded with his third term push, we probably would be saddled with a life president today as nothing stops anybody from removing term limits from the constitution. Nigeria dodged a bullet! Thankfully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPLATEAU KILLINGS\n\nI join well-meaning Nigerians in condemning the massacre of 22 travellers, all Muslims, in Plateau state last weekend. But as it is usual with us, the reactions were so predictable. While southern newspapers buried the story in inside pages, northern papers splashed it on the front. If the victims were Christians, you can bet the reverse would be the case. We need to get to a stage where we would be angry and saddened by the avoidable death of any Nigerian \u2014 no matter the religion and ethnicity. The truth is that this country has woefully failed to protect ordinary Nigerians, no matter where they come from. As I keep saying, nobody can claim to be safe in Nigeria. Fact.\n\nCATCH-22 HARAM\n\nThe Nigerian government is faced with a dilemma of monumental proportions on what to do with the \u201crepentant\u201d Boko Haram fighters who appear to be in disarray after the death of Abubakar Shekau. Many of them are reportedly surrendering to the Nigerian military. Ordinarily, this should be good news. But we first have to be sure this is for real. Are they truly Boko Haram fighters? Have they truly repented or are they just trying to catch their breath before regrouping? Can a leopard change its spots? If they have truly repented, should they be granted amnesty or made to pay for their crime? Or can they become assets for the security agencies in the war on terror? Quandary.",

Why should you be angry or afraid that oil may be found up north? You want only your region to have oil so that you can continue to belittle others as parasites? Really? This is what the Yoruba call the spirit of \u201ckenimani\u201d (wishing others will not prosper like you).\n\nWhat I find most troubling is that it appears we have been programmed in Nigeria to see and amplify the worst of things. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) had been gathering dust on the shelves of the national assembly since 2008. The original idea was to create an omnibus and contemporary law to govern the oil industry. In 2000, President Olusegun Obasanjo set up the Dr Emmanuel Egbogah-led Oil and Gas Implementation Committee (OGIC) for this purpose. Egbogah, now of blessed memory, was one of the most respected experts in the oil industry globally. The work of OGIC gave birth to the PIB, which was first sent to the national legislature in 2008 by President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nBedevilled by intrigues (including the absurd claim in 2012 that fake versions were being circulated among the federal lawmakers), the PIB remained a dream. Now that we have finally crossed the finish line, the first wave of reaction has been so predictable: condemnation, laced with threats. Of course, the Buhari administration has done a poor job in the area of communication. (Lai Mohammed, the information minister, is only interested in bullying the social media.) That governors are issuing press statements to air their reservations over the PIA says a lot about how this administration communicates with the key stakeholders. Victory is gradually turning to defeat!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStates have legitimate reasons to be worried over the PIA. The frontier exploration fund will affect FAAC. The host community fund will also affect FAAC. At a time of dwindling revenues, everyone, including the federal government, has reasons to worry. Every little kobo will impact on federation allocation. But we have to see this as a matter of trade-off: more revenue to communities and less to FAAC, more revenue for investment in exploration and less money to FAAC \u2014 but the \u201closses\u201d are balanced with peace in the host communities and the benefit of investing in frontier exploration today so that we can have more revenue to share tomorrow. This should be seen as a win-win.\n\nFor full disclosure, I am a \u201cpetro-sceptic\u201d. I hold the position that oil wealth has done extensive damage to Nigeria and Nigerians. I am one of those who theorise that the hydrocarbon has ruined or retarded Nigeria\u2019s human, economic and political development in the last 45 years. I am of the view that the petrodollar has led to poor governance and fuelled corruption and conflict. I believe we would have attained real development if we had not enjoyed oil boom and had continued on our path of agriculture and industrialisation as it was in the 1950s and 60s. I believe the boom-bust cycle of oil has derailed our development trajectory and thrown us into a chronic cyclical economic crisis.\n\nNevertheless, I cannot deceive myself by trying to run away from the fact that the petrodollar remains the backbone of Nigeria\u2019s public finance and the supplier of most of the forex. We cannot deny that. Therefore, when you realise the amount of investments Nigeria has lost over the years because of the uncertainty over the PIB, you would appreciate why passing the legislation is a milestone worth celebrating. According to Buhari, Nigeria lost $50 billion worth of investments in the past 10 years to the uncertainty. If this economy can receive such investments in the next 10 years, assuming things go well, there is no way we won\u2019t feel some positive impact.\n\nI understand that people must play politics. I also understand that part of playing politics in Nigeria is to raise the stakes to take as much as you can get from the system. The oil communities have every right to try to hold on tightly to their natural resources. It is their luck that there is plenty hydrocarbon in the bellies of their earth. Left to me, they can keep all the revenue. Nobody will die. Many countries don\u2019t have oil. However, in all these agitations, we should appreciate progress. From zero naira to N200 billion is progress in my books. We should also not stop other parts of Nigeria from exploring for more oil. And, above all, let us stick to the facts and stop the mischief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nROAD TAX\n\nThe story is told of a student who exploited his illiterate parents by saying his teacher asked him to buy three books: Dic, Tion and Ary. He simply broke dictionary into three! The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is about to pull a fast one on Nigerians by seeking to institute \u201croad tax\u201d \u2014the permit to put your vehicle on the road. It is the same thing as the \u201cvehicle licence\u201d that we already pay for in Nigeria. It is called \u201croad tax\u201d in the UK. Somebody from FIRS obviously travelled to the UK and thought he had made a big discovery. If we don\u2019t rise up against the proposed tax, FIRS will succeed in making monkeys out of all Nigerians. And toll gates are about to return. Crafty.\n\nMANTLE OF DEMOCRACY\n\nWhen former deputy senate president, Alhaji Ibrahim Mantu, died at the age of 74 on Tuesday from COVID-19 complications, my mind went back to the third term plot of President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2006. Mantu was at the forefront. I was very critical of him. It was only recently we got to know, through Chief Orji Uzor Kalu\u2019s memoir, that Mantu was actually working against it. If indeed this is true, then Mantu deserves to be regarded as a hero of our democracy. If Obasanjo had succeeded with his third term push, we probably would be saddled with a life president today as nothing stops anybody from removing term limits from the constitution. Nigeria dodged a bullet! Thankfully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPLATEAU KILLINGS\n\nI join well-meaning Nigerians in condemning the massacre of 22 travellers, all Muslims, in Plateau state last weekend. But as it is usual with us, the reactions were so predictable. While southern newspapers buried the story in inside pages, northern papers splashed it on the front. If the victims were Christians, you can bet the reverse would be the case. We need to get to a stage where we would be angry and saddened by the avoidable death of any Nigerian \u2014 no matter the religion and ethnicity. The truth is that this country has woefully failed to protect ordinary Nigerians, no matter where they come from. As I keep saying, nobody can claim to be safe in Nigeria. Fact.\n\nCATCH-22 HARAM\n\nThe Nigerian government is faced with a dilemma of monumental proportions on what to do with the \u201crepentant\u201d Boko Haram fighters who appear to be in disarray after the death of Abubakar Shekau. Many of them are reportedly surrendering to the Nigerian military. Ordinarily, this should be good news. But we first have to be sure this is for real. Are they truly Boko Haram fighters? Have they truly repented or are they just trying to catch their breath before regrouping? Can a leopard change its spots? If they have truly repented, should they be granted amnesty or made to pay for their crime? Or can they become assets for the security agencies in the war on terror? Quandary.",

          "title": "Explained: Can the Nigerian government really spy on your WhatsApp messages?",
          "text": "Barely a month after blocking access to Twitter, the Nigerian government allocated \u20a61.93 billion ($4.6 million) to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) for a \u201cWhatsApp Intercept Solution\u201d.\n\nAn interception solution for WhatsApp would allow an external party (the government, in this case) to access, monitor, or block communications (calls and chats) carried out by users via the app.\n\nThe move is reportedly aimed at protecting Nigeria from cybercrime and terrorism perpetrated through such messaging platforms. However, it is seen by media stakeholders and activists as yet another attempt to restrict civil liberties.\n\nHowever, some uncertainty hangs over how Nigerian authorities plan to go about intercepting WhatsApp, particularly because the platform uses end-to-end encryption for its messages. TechCabal examines the possibility of such interception and technical intricacies involved.\n\nWhat is end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a technology that ensures chats can only be read by the sender and recipient and not intercepted by a middleman. Messages are scrambled when they leave the sender\u2019s device and can be decoded only by the recipient\u2019s device.\n\nWhatsApp uses the popular Signal encryption protocol that involves exchanging unique security keys that are verified between users, to avoid any kind of interception by a middle person.\n\nWhatever is said between users with WhatsApp is guaranteed to be private during transmission.\n\nAccording to a cybersecurity expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intercepting this flow of messages during transit across the internet is near-impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just impossible. The government would have to force every WhatsApp user in Nigeria to use a particular security key,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somehow it\u2019s pulled off and some messages are accessed, the encryption makes it much harder, if not impossible, to read them.\u201d\n\nHowever, an interception is possible if there\u2019s a vulnerability in the implementation of the encryption system and that\u2019s one problem with WhatsApp\u2019s security.\n\nBreaking down the WhatsApp encryption\n\nOn WhatsApp, new encryption keys are generated for users who log in with a new device, and messages that were in transit to them while offline get re-encrypted and resent automatically.\n\nThe sender does not get an opportunity to stop the messages from being resent nor to verify the recipient.\n\nBy forcing users to change security keys without informing them, WhatsApp\u2019s encryption can be circumvented and a third party could spy on messages without the app knowing, a security researcher found in 2017.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn a situation where a WhatsApp user\u2019s sim card was stolen and put in another phone, this re-encryption of messages could allow a third party to intercept and read previously undelivered chats.\n\nBut the security threats from the design, which is meant to make WhatsApp more convenient to use, are small and unlikely to affect most users. In most cases, it would work for potential targeting of individuals, and not mass surveillance, like the Nigerian government probably intends to do.\n\nTo fix the issue, a sender can activate security notification settings in the WhatsApp app and would be informed whenever the recipient\u2019s key changes.\n\nOpen the app and go to the Settings menu. In there, click Account and then Security. The page has just one option: \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d \u2013 turn on that option and the app will send an alert every time the security key changes.\n\nStorage loopholes\n\nThere are also vulnerabilities with how WhatsApp messages are stored, which could be exploited by hackers.\n\nWhatsApp chats are saved in four locations, from where data can be retrieved later. These include the phone memories of both the sender and receiver, WhatsApp\u2019s server, and on the cloud, depending on if a user allowed it in the app\u2019s settings.\n\nSpyware dropped on the phone of either the sender or receiver could read the messages before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. On a few occasions, hackers and government agencies have been alleged to use spyware for decrypted messages on targeted phones.\n\nAn instance is the hacking of several WhatsApp accounts in 2019 by the Pegasus remote surveillance software made by Israel-based cyber tech firm, NSO. Ex-Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, saw his phone hacked in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message purportedly sent by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe cloud backup of messages can also be hacked. In the case of WhatsApp, users get the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but the copies aren\u2019t protected by the end-to-end encryption. Hence, an attacker could access old chats if they hack into a cloud storage account.\n\nOn national security grounds, the Nigerian government could approach WhatsApp to request access to certain information stored on its servers but not chats because that violates privacy laws, the expert said.\n\nChat platforms often don\u2019t store messages on their servers. WhatsApp claims it only does so if chats cannot be delivered immediately \u2013 for example, in instances where the receiver is offline, the sender\u2019s messages are kept on the server for 30 days. Once they\u2019re delivered, Whatsapp deletes the messages from the server.\n\nWhatsApp has repeatedly said that with end-to-end encryption, only both parties in the conversation and nobody in between, not even the company itself, can decode what\u2019s sent. Thus, it has often expressed helplessness to law enforcement agencies pressing for access to private messages, in countries like India.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhatsApp Messenger enjoys a reputation of confidentiality but even encryption has its vulnerabilities.\n\nIn theory, any device or service is susceptible to hackers, but encryption technology offers protection in most cases and WhatsApp is often quick to issue updates including security fixes.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the Nigerian government intends to go about tracking WhatsApp messages after earmarking billions of naira for the said interception solution.\n\nWith over 90 million Nigerian users per data from Statista, WhatsApp is the most popular social media platform used in the country. Any attempt to tamper with the application would thus affect a massive number of people.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us. Our legal and government relations teams are looking into it but we thought it was important to let you know that your money remains safe with Bamboo and will always be readily accessible. \u2014 Bamboo (@investbamboo) August 17, 2021\n\nSo far none of the affected companies has come out to refute this claim. This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement. It took a lot of explaining and convincing to get users to trust that their money was safe and the activities of the fintech platform is legal. This recent announcement would cause massive reputational damage.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to the affected fintech companies and is awaiting their comments.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed).

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019.

The demise of one of Nigeria\u2019s finest military officers is a painful loss to our state and the country.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to remember the late General for his meritorious service to his fatherland as well as statesmanship. He shall be sorely missed not only by his family and kinsmen in Ilaro, but the entire people Ogun, and by extension Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI pray the Almighty God rest his soul, forgive his shortcomings and grant his family members fortitude to bear this irreplaceable loss\u201d.

          "text": "First Lady of Lagos, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu at the weekend said societal stability and sustainable development by the nation will remain a mirage if proper attention is not accorded the strengthening of family as an important social institution.\n\nSanwo-Olu, represented by Mrs Olabisi Onigbanjo, spoke at the 2021 Family Day Celebration organised by the Ministry of Youth and Social Development at Adeyemi Nero Auditorium, Alausa.\n\nStressing the significance of the theme \u201cStronger Families, Stronger Communities\u201d, the First Lady said, \u201d this could not have come at a better time given the need to build on the strength of the families as a unifying factor in achieving societal stability and sustainable development.\n\n\u201cThe aim therefore is to create awareness on the indelible mark the family institution has made towards emotional, economic and spiritual well being of the people. I am confident that if we are able to sustain strong family institution in our State, prosperous future for all is assured. \u201d\n\nAccording to her, the upsurge in social vices like drug abuse, cultism and kidnappings bedevilling the society could be traced to parents abandonment of their responsibilities in pursuit of economic activities to house helps,unwilling neighbours and unhealthy family lifestyle.\n\nTowards economic empowerment to take good care of children, the First Lady disclosed that Lagos State Government under Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has put in place various programmes and policies to empower residents and fight poverty which include opportunities like Employment Trust Fund,Youth and Women Empowerment,among others.\n\nEarlier, Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr Olusegun Dawodu stated that International Day of Family was usually marked globally by Governments and Organisations to celebrate the contribution of the family institution to the stability of the society and create awareness on issues affecting family in order to make the institution stronger in promoting social harmony and stability.\n\nIn his words, \u201cthe family institution as we all know plays a critical role in our society as a powerful force for social cohesion and integration. As we face multiple challenges in our changing world one factor remains constant: the timeless importance of family and their invaluable contribution in raising the next generation of leaders is commendable.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Government is therefore committed to elevating and enhancing this institution in its effort to transform the State by promoting the interest of families and children in the State.\u201d\n\nThe Guest lecturer, Deputy Vice Chancellor, Lagos State University, Professor Wahab Elias explained that the family system breeds technology, culture, politics, religion, education, economy and other spheres that make up the totality of the society.\n\nElias attributed the disruption of the family system to the advent of the Second Industrial Revolution which paved way for divorce and other forms of ills threatening the society.\n\nIn the Year 2021 Family Day competition, Mr & Mrs Sufianu Abdulrasheed from Agege L.G took the 1st position; Mr&Mrs Davies from Onigbongbo LCDA took 2nd position and Alhaji & Alhaja S.A.O Ogunnubi from Mushin LG took 3rd position.\n\nAll the families representing the 20 LGAs and 37 LCDAs were all presented with certificates and gifts.",
          "summary": "First Lady of Lagos, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu at the weekend said societal stability and sustainable development by the nation will remain a mirage if proper attention is not accorded the strengthening of family as an important social institution.\nStressing the significance of the theme \u201cStronger Families, Stronger Communities\u201d, the First Lady said, \u201d this could not have come at a better time given the need to build on the strength of the families as a unifying factor in achieving societal stability and sustainable development.\n\u201cThe aim therefore is to create awareness on the indelible mark the family institution has made towards emotional, economic and spiritual well being of the people.\nI am confident that if we are able to sustain strong family institution in our State, prosperous future for all is assured.\nIn his words, \u201cthe family institution as we all know plays a critical role in our society as a powerful force for social cohesion and integration.",

          "text": "Samuel Kyaahu, 46, lives in a makeshift tent with his wife and three children. It is from the confines of that small space that they find ways to navigate uncertainty and adapt to a new normal.\n\nFour years ago, they were displaced from their village in Torkula along with many others and fled to the Mbawa Internally Displaced Peoples Camp in Daudu \u2013 a satellite town along the Makurdi-Lafia highway.\n\nThe camp, provided by international NGO Medecins Sans Frontiers, has tents for over 10,000 internally displaced persons, a health centre, and access to water and sanitation services, among other things.\n\nREAD ALSO: The Devastating Flood That Left Taraba Residents In Distress\n\nBut it is not home.\n\nThe IDPs want to return to the homes they were forced to flee and need the help of the government to rebuild, resettle and plan for a better future.\n\n\u201cI have three children here with me and they do not go to school. They are here suffering with me. I think tomorrow will be worse than this,\u201d Samuel says, expressing fears for his children\u2019s future under the circumstances.\n\nSamuel and his family are not alone in this appeal. Comfort Bako who is pregnant with her 7th child says there is nowhere like home, if only security is assured.\n\n\u201cIf the government can help us to stop the fight so that everyone can go back to their homes and work, we will be able to struggle as we were doing before to get something to take care of the children,\u201d she says in pidgin English.\n\nAt the camp, there are many weary faces \u2013 from the aged to distressed mothers; all worrying about what to eat with their families and how to educate their children, a situation that gets tougher with each passing day.\n\nFeeding is a major challenge for the IDPs. Due to the large population at the camp, the government\u2019s food supplies are never enough. To supplement this, some of the IDPs resort to cooking almost-spoiled or perishing food items sourced from dealers in the local market.\n\n\u201cFor the issue of food, the government is trying,\u201d says Camp Manager Comfort Alugah. \u201cBut the government cannot satisfy everybody.\u201d\n\nMrs Alugah attributes the challenge to the population at the camp which she put at 43,344.\n\nIn terms of health care, the Mbawa IDP camp has a maternal and child health clinic operated by Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF).\n\nThe clinic has been providing care for the babies delivered in the camp and their mothers, with assistance from the Benue State Ministry of Health, ensuring safe delivery after months of antenatal services.\n\nInterventions by the MSF at the camp also include the provision of emergency primary health care, emergency water and sanitation services, and shelter.\n\n\u201cWe have also recently included programmes of reproductive health, and sexual and gender-based violence response,\u201d says Project Coordinator MSF, Benue State, Prosper Ndumuraro.\n\nMSF, which provides such medical intervention across the state, says the IDPs are doing better than when they first came to the camp but a lot more needs to be done.\n\nThe IDPs, while grateful to be alive, will rather bring up their families in their own homes, hence the continuous appeal for government to hasten the resettlement plans.\n\nAn overwhelming task\n\nFor some close observers of the attacks and violence that has displaced a multitude of people in Benue State, going home at this moment is like returning to a den of hungry lions. Many of the IDPs such as Comfort Bako believe the violence has to stop for them to return home and have any shot at a positive future.\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom is also worried about the plight of the IDPs and the continuing attacks.\n\n\u201cWe never envisaged that we will have 500 IDPs (in Benue) and then it (the figure) will rise to over 1.5 million and we are still counting,\u201d the governor lamented when he visited and IDP camp in Ortese, last week.\n\nWith over a million people now displaced in the state, satisfying the needs of the IDPs have become \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, says the governor, who has called government at all levels to close ranks and provide for the huge number of displaced persons.\n\nWithin the past decade, hundreds of people have fled from attacks, attributed to armed herdsmen, on n rural farming communities within Benue State and are taking refuge in various official and unofficial camps, many with just mosquito nets as shelter.\n\nInterventions from the government and support from humanitarian non-governmental organizations have gone a long way in helping the IDPs combat ailments, diseases, hunger, starvation and a dearth of water supply.\n\nWithin the duration of their stay in different camps, many IDPs have been exposed to new study programs and skill acquisition exercises, however, for many of these individuals, there is still something that leaves them unfulfilled \u2013 they miss their homes.\n\nThrough thick and thin, the IDPs of Benue have a burning desire to return home and the big questions is who will make that possible.",

          "text": "As Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, Islamist groups waging insurgencies in Africa were quick to celebrate.\n\n\u201cGod is great,\u201d a media outlet linked to Somalia\u2019s al-Shabab wrote in response to the takeover.\n\nElsewhere, the leader of al-Qaeda affiliate Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) used his first public message since 2019 to congratulate the Taliban.\n\n\u201cWe are winning,\u201d Iyad Ag Ghaly said, drawing comparisons between the withdrawal of foreign troops in Afghanistan and France\u2019s decision to reduce its military presence in West Africa\u2019s Sahel region.\n\nAnd it is not just Africa\u2019s Islamist fighters who have been seeing parallels with Afghanistan.\n\nFrom Somalia in the east to Nigeria in the west, newspapers have published articles and citizens have taken to social media to share their concerns.\n\nIf a wake-up call was needed for African governments heavily reliant on foreign support in their fight against Islamist insurgents, then the Taliban\u2019s seizure of Afghanistan is likely to be it.\n\nSince 2012, Mali \u2013 one of Africa\u2019s biggest countries \u2013 has been battling various jihadist groups in its northern and central regions.\n\nIt has had to rely on French troops and UN peacekeepers to keep the militants from taking control.\n\nHowever, the presence of soldiers from the former colonial power has been unpopular with some Malians, as well as some in France.\n\nIn June, France announced the drawdown of its forces, reducing their numbers to 2,500-3,000 by early next year.\n\nThere is concern that Malian troops, who are often poorly trained and ill-equipped, will not be able to contain Islamist groups.\n\nChildren seat by their shelter in Goudebou, a camp that welcomes more than 11,000 Malian refugees in northern Burkina Faso, on International Refugee Day on June 20, 2021.\n\n\u201cMany people are afraid because the situation is likely to be the same [as Afghanistan],\u201d says Bouraima Guindo, editor-in-chief of Mali\u2019s Le Pays newspaper.\n\n\u201cThe presence of those foreign soldiers is very necessary because if they leave tomorrow, the situation will be more dangerous.\u201d\n\nLike other publications in Mali, Le Pays has called on the country\u2019s leaders to do more to strengthen its armed forces.\n\nThere is also concern in Somalia, which has drawn some of the strongest comparisons to Afghanistan.\n\nSomalia suffered state collapse and decades of civil war before an insurgency by the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabab group began in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe internationally backed government has struggled to regain control of much of the country and is reliant on African Union troops operating under a UN Security Council mandate.\n\nThe goal has been to uproot the militants while giving the government time to build institutions.\n\nBut as in Afghanistan, there have been widespread accusations of corruption. There have also been clashes in the capital this year over delayed elections, which saw parts of the security forces turn on each other.\n\nThese issues have raised doubts over Somalia\u2019s state-building project.\n\nIlham Gassar, a political advisor to the UN mission in Somalia, says international partners had been focusing on destroying al-Shabab, not developing a strong state.\n\n\u201cThe focus was never to make the average Somali\u2019s life better and to create systems of sustainability,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Somali government was meant to take the lead on security operations by the end of this year, but that looks unlikely due to questions over the army\u2019s capability.\n\nSamira Gaid, head of Somali security think-tank Hiraal Institute, says Somali forces are even less prepared to halt a potential militant offensive than those in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cSomali security forces have not received 0.005% of what the Afghan security forces have received,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cTangible support towards the rebuilding of the Somali security forces has been minimal. Somalia is still under an arms embargo, so we are unable to purchase the type of weaponry that Afghanistan had.\u201d\n\nBut even in Somalia the focus has shifted to how and when to end foreign assistance.\n\nThe EU has already started cutting back its funding, and the government is running out of time to get itself ready to be self-sufficient.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, Islamist movements in Africa have flourished in countries where they have been able to capitalise on weak state institutions, a lack of services like education and healthcare, and issues with poverty.\n\nThese factors led to the emergence of insurgents in Mozambique\u2019s Cabo Delgado region, and were used by groups in West Africa as a way to recruit fighters and gain public support.\n\nIn some cases, insurgents have stepped in to provide services and better justice in communities, which has helped them gain legitimacy.\n\nFrance is reducing its military presence in Africa\u2019s Sahel region.\n\nThere is a general acceptance across Africa that military operations will not be enough to eradicate violent extremism and that more needs to be done to find political solutions \u2013 perhaps even negotiating with insurgents.\n\nBut security expert Fulan Nasrullah says it would be a shock if any of the Islamist groups in West Africa were to capture a state and hold it.\n\n\u201cPeople should not interpret Africa or every other jihadi Islamist group through the prism of what just happened in Afghanistan \u2013 the contexts are different but there are a few similarities,\u201d he says.\n\nThe groups fighting in West Africa are not a cohesive force like the Taliban, they are a mixture of various militias, whose goals sometimes align but not always and increasingly the global contest between IS and al-Qaeda has seen their affiliates fighting each other.\n\nWest Africa\u2019s Islamist groups \u201cexist in a climate where the state is weak, but they are weaker than the weak states\u201d, Mr Nasrullah says.\n\nIt is too soon to know how developments in Afghanistan might affect policy in Africa. But the conversation has begun on how to ensure a better exit for foreign powers.\n\nComfort Ero, from the International Crisis Group think-tank, says there are \u201cimmediate lessons\u201d to be learned.\n\nShe says there is a \u201cperennial problem of governments mired in corruption, heavily dependent on foreign/external support, with little or sometimes flimsy legitimacy at home, so that when international support is withdrawn, what we are left with are artificial states unable to extend their remit\u201d.\n\nAmid the shocking scenes of people trying to flee Afghanistan, Ms Gaid says she believes there would be a \u201cpause on the part of international partners\u201d to ensure there were not similar situations in countries like Somalia.\n\n\u201cIt will be more staggered, and they will be more deliberate about an eventual exit,\u201d she says.\n\nBBC",
