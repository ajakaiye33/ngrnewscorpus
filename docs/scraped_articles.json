          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities has said it will meet with the Federal Government on Friday to avert another round of strike in federal universities.\n\nThe National President, ASUU, Prof Emmanuel Osodeke, told our correspondent that the union was invited by the Ministry of Labour to discuss issues surrounding the Memorandum of Action, which was signed with the Federal Government in December 2020.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported on Wednesday that the spokesman for the Ministry of Education, Ben Gong, challenged the union to be more specific in its allegations that the government had violated agreements it reached with the union.\n\nHe pointed out that the University Transparency and Accountability Solution, which was developed by ASUU, could not deduct tax.\n\nHowever, Osodeke, explained the last time the union met with the government was around March/April, adding that it was the Minister of Labour, Dr Chris Ngige, who invited the officials to Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Ministry of Education, which is our ministry, has not called us to any meeting since we signed the Memorandum of Action. But the Ministry of Labour, which is just an intervention ministry, around March/April called us to a meeting in which we discussed and they promised to implement all those things.\n\n\u201cThree weeks ago, we met with the Minister of Labour, who said we should give him two weeks and he has finally invited us to a meeting on Friday. The spokesman for the Ministry of Education, Goon, has hatred for this union; he just pushes out lies without consulting. Ask him when you see him, has the ministry ever invited us since the MoA was signed to say they have done this and couldn\u2019t do that?\u201d\n\nOsodeke said ASUU never said it would go on strike, but was calling on the government to do the needful.\n\n\u201cI have not mentioned strike; what we have said is that we have issues, which the Federal Government has not resolved and I hope that they will resolve them before the next ASUU NEC meeting in August, where we will decide on what to do. I have not used the word strike. It is when NEC meets that we will decide on what to do, but it seems that the press and Nigerians always interpret it as a strike,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Interviews with individuals familiar with these movements revealed that about 80 fighters in two batches arrived in Nigeria from Libya in April.\n\n\u201cAmong other reasons, some fled after the 2016 Boko Haram split, having been disillusioned by what they saw as the selfishness of leaders in both factions, JAS and ISWAP.\n\n\u201cWith support from IS, ISWAP relies on an elaborate network of contacts and routes cutting across West and North Africa (Libya-Algeria-Mali-Niger-Nigeria) to facilitate the movements of fighters. About 120 more, including Arabs who will be permanently based in the region as part of the leadership, are now expected from Libya.\u201d\n\nThe report also said the Islamic State was proposing to set up four caliphates in Borno to oversee its activities in the Lake Chad Basin area and beyond.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nBy Emmanuel Umohinyang\n\n\u201cWhen we lose someone we love, we must learn not to live without them, but to live with the love they left behind\u201d \u2013 Anonymous.\n\nPerhaps, the greatest revelation about why Nigeria has failed to develop despite enormous potentials for greatness showed at independence was as witnessed in the life and times of the founder of the Synagogue of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet T.B Joshua who passed on recently.\n\nThough buried, his good deeds which took the world by storm will remain evergreen across the nations of the world because the man at the Synagogue was a global brand.\n\nFor some of us who were lucky to be very close to him, we usually watched in awe how he was able to combine many rare virtues, which were the major reasons he shook the world.\n\nREAD ALSO:Buhari approves Reps\u2019 Bill seeking to establish Orthopedic Hospital in Jos\n\nJoshua was not your typical Pastor who because of fame, money, connections, and what have you look down on anyone, irrespective of race, tribe, or religion. He was a citizen of the world. That his background as someone who rose from the ashes of his sleepy community of Arigidi Akoko shaped his worldview was never in doubt.\n\nHe saw his Pastoral calling as a task that must be done the exact way Jesus Christ did His and he committed everything that he had into that project until he breathed his last.\n\nWatching him alone was evangelism itself as he did unimaginable things least expected of a man of his stature across the globe, even at great risk to his health and safety. Even when God started rewarding his efforts and enlarging his congregation worldwide, he allowed Jesus to show him to the world as he avoided the media like a plague.\n\nDespite this, the media never left him alone, they used the Prophet to sell their stories as the mere mention of his name was enough to sell their papers.\n\nCuriously, many of these stories were nothing but gibberish, concocted to tarnish his growing profile, locally and internationally, but he was never perturbed. For him, he had a job to do because he believed God\u2019s work was too much to be set aside, to start fighting enemies who never saw anything good in what he was doing. He believed that he would be distracted, on too small a challenge to hinder the project assigned to him by the Almighty.\n\nIn fact, he used to tell us that distraction is a very powerful tool of the Satan to stop the children of God from getting to their destination. Curiously, some of his greatest traducers were enemies within the body of Christ who are obviously jealous of his profile.\n\nThese are influential Pastors who were never offended in any way by the Prophet but saw him as a man that needed to be driven out of the vineyard. They expected him to be angry, not Joshua, as he had even forgiven them before they asked to be forgiven because his heart would not harbor ill feelings against anyone.\n\nHe saw in their hatred the lubricant to fly even higher than they anticipated, even as the world became his church, to the astonishment of his enemies. Even when he had a medium to castigate his adversaries, Joshua chose to dedicate it to preaching messages of love, forgiveness and sacrifice.\n\nWere he to sue the media, both Local and International for damaging his reputation he would have made a fortune from that alone.\n\nToday, some of those media outfits have turned a new leaf, without the Prophet reaching out to them because he allowed his Creator to fight for him.\n\nHe believed our Creator is the ultimate fighter and has enough weapons to fight for everyone who has been wrongly accused as long as he keeps faith with him.\n\nA journalist from one of the leading newspapers recently narrated how a member of the Prophet\u2019s church approached him to do a damaging story on the man of God.\n\nHe later went to Joshua to balance the story only to discover that the widow was on Joshua\u2019s payroll and her children were been sent to school by the Cleric.\n\nThe Journalist was stunned after the Prophet called the woman to come for more money, and had to challenge the woman who burst into tears and pleading for forgiveness after collecting the cash.\n\nOf course, she was forgiven immediately by Joshua who counselled her to sin no more. That is the man at the Synagogue for you.\n\nThis was a man who saw the world as a stage to play his godly assignment saw and maximized the privilege to touch lives like never before. Despite being well to do, he was never ostentatious, and his hands were mainly to offer help, especially to the indigent.\n\nHe was not one of those Pastors living large in luxurious apartments, driving the best of cars and acquiring aircrafts while their people languish in poverty. Joshua was not one of those whose church established varsities that cannot be afforded by poor members of their church. He was in a class of his own.\n\nA place like Lagos where he lived and died would have declared a public holiday in honour of such enigma, but not the present state government. While the nation, starting from the President to the National Assembly and most states rose to the occasion, conspicuously missing was Lagos, a state that prides itself as the \u201cCentre of Excellence\u201d.\n\nTo put it mildly, the state governor was simply lost at sea, from start to finish of all that concerned the Prophet\u2019s passing and burial.\n\nEven the press statement condoling with the church and family came only after many states and nations had done theirs.\n\nShockingly, Joshua\u2019s contributions to the growth and development of Lagos cannot be overemphasized. In fact, no other state in this country benefited from his personae which attracted tons of cash in local and foreign currency to the coffers of the state.\n\nThat he was the single major revenue earner for the nation was not in doubt and all these came in through Lagos which was his base.\n\nIt was therefore immature and illogical on the part of Governor Babajide Sanwo- Olu of Lagos state not to have been a critical part of events before and during his burial which was graced by his colleagues from other states, including Ondo.\n\nThe Prophet\u2019s philanthropy was legendary \u2013 Health, Education, Sports, empowerment, Infrastructure, evangelism, and many others\u2019 too numerous to mention, of which Lagos was a beneficiary.\n\nWere he to react, Joshua would have in his usual style smiled and brushed these aside, as he is not one of those men of God always in bed with the famous and affluent.\n\nHis greatest joy would be that he served his creator with all his might to the very end and that the poor, the weak, the sick, the homeless and the hopeless whom he loved so dearly were there for him till the very end.\n\nHe was more concerned about the stewardship he would render to his creator about his sojourn on earth. In fact, the deluge of tributes he has received across the globe since his demise is legendary. His burial took an International dimension as friends and well-wishers were physically present from all parts of the world to bid farewell in these trying times.\n\nIndeed, a king would not have received the kind of honour given to him by the good people of Ikotun who shut down their businesses for one week in his honour. The take away from Joshua\u2019s life and death are that we should remain committed to our convictions, not minding the distractions on our way, for that is the key to ultimate victory.\n\nAdieu the man at the Synagogue.\n\nUmohinyang, a Social Commentator and Public Affairs Analyst, writes from Abuja",

          "text": ".\n\n\u201cWe are but the atoms in the incessant human struggle towards the light that shines in darkness\u201d \u2013 Emma Goldman\n\nBeaten by poverty, haunted by the decadence of morals, we have increasingly found ourselves unable to make moral choices, too ineffectual to recognize what is wrong or right and at the extreme, we roll with a culture that promotes accountability free zone, at private and public lives. With a sealed mind, we have destroyed guilt image processors and shamelessly proudly validate what ordinarily should be morally repellant to a decent society.\n\nA society that can no longer draw moral lines has entered a breath gasping trough of dastardly death. Where walls of morals collapse, the bridge of law usually caves in, leaving justice sunk in a mire of muddled waters.\n\nIn private and public spaces, Nigeria is being turned into a neighbourhood of chaos, with neither norms nor standards to guide an individual or corporate behaviour. She has become a burial ground of morals. A tragic state of anomie has emerged. Might is right! Bubu is always right- and Obi can never be wrong- the crowd are everywhere you go!\n\nYes, it is true! Obi Cubana buried his mother in Oba with anthills of Dollar and Naira obscenely displayed but then, legislators in the National Assembly are burying the country every day with loots from the immoral and illegal constituency projects that have become their own cesspools.\n\nWhat is the difference between Obi Cubana and the President who borrowed money on behalf of Nigeria and Nigerians only to deploy the loan to build a railway line to Maradi in the Niger Republic? It does not even shock us again that a President that was elected to put in place robust health care facilities for the country has the audacity to be receiving health care from another country. What could be more Cubana? Yet, you have some characters defending him with the baseless excuse that he has been using the Doctors for decades.\n\nDo they even realize that leadership is a sacrifice? What if his Doctors in the United Kingdom died? We defend shit too much in this country.\n\nOn a private or public level, we are as lawless as immoral! We are as unaccountable as irresponsible! We are as insensitive as irresponsive! Over the years, we have built a culture of insensitive irresponsive and unaccountable leadership as well as that of irresponsible followership! Just as some people are shamelessly defending monumental governmental failure, many, whose tool of view is ethnic lens are unreasonably justifying the offensive bizarre bazaar that took place in Oba.\n\nThose who focus on the enjoyment of fruits of labour while ignoring the psychological dimensions and the consequences of ostentatious lifestyle, the damage it does to the psyche and mind of the weak and poor in society may not understand the weight of its cost to society. Obi Invictus told the story of his kidding financial wizardry too. We hailed him. We celebrated his astonishing success and projected him as an example of hardworking youth that fitted into the model of a new improved Nigerian smart financial genius.\n\nToday, he is languishing in an American prison for multiple and serial credit card frauds. Woe betides a people who do not ask the right questions at right time! Mammoth worshipping, Hushpuppy hailing people without basic training on how unsavoury fiduciary private and public conduct breed criminals, reinforces crime culture and exacerbates violence are everywhere affirming \u2018it is his money logic. People that don\u2019t ask deep questions hardly find answers to weightier issues of life that imposes a burden for accountability on midday naked dancers! Everyone thought \u2018Shigidi\u2019 was a god until it bathed in rainwater.\n\nNo institution or person should be free from the scrutiny of laws and morals that society adopts. Each time a person deviates from what looks like a normal pathway, he sends forth a ripple. It is the duty of people to unriddle the ripple, to save society from unnecessary moral conflict and rescue her people from lethargic apathy toward common concerns for neighbour\u2019s love or actions that diminish humanity! Moderation is preached, not because society wants to rob wealthy people of access to luxury but to maintain and sustain societal sanity.\n\nEvery action has unintended consequences. Ostentatious display of wealth, even legitimate wealth of one\n\ncan lead to the suicide of another. Also, avaricious displays of one can push another into crime. So, being your brother\u2019s keepers is not about the tangible assistance offered; it is more about the conscious sacrifice you make to support his or her sanity, Albeit, through the intangible offering of hope that does not task his feeble mental health and capacity to cope with burden whose stressor is principally poverty! No society can afford the excesses of those who deliberately set tables of temptation for its vast population of the poor to feast on!\n\nAn obscenely reckless lifestyle enables criminality and drives crime. Cubana and gang are tragic quadrants in that equation. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the monies are legitimately made or not.\n\nNo society deserves to be afflicted with insensitive irresponsible avaricious insanity; more so, a society whose people are encumbered with inequality propelled the psycho-economic burden of unjust poverty.\n\nThere is no nice way of saying that they are derelict in their responsibility to society by recklessly promoting tempting ostentation, as evidence of wealth, in an impoverished society that has been ranked as the global parish of the poor! If we fail in making people responsible in the private sphere, we cannot succeed in making those in the public sphere accountable. We must be able to set benchmarks for accountability.\n\nWe must be able to tell those that are celebrating the acquisition of Super Tucano Jets as an almighty formula for war-winning, that a Super Tucano is a Dane gun in the hands of an unwilling State; and that a Dane gun is a Super Tucano in the hands of a willing state.\n\nHow do we confront irresponsible cruel rulers who forced children in all nooks and crannies of Nigeria to obtain NIN at the height of the virulent COVID as a condition to register for GCE, NECO and JAMB online only for them to now say \u2018NO\u2019 to Electronic Transfer of Election results if we don\u2019t stand on solid moral ground?\n\nWe must as a people put an end to speculation about where we stand on the issue of morals, law and justice. We cannot afford to trade off decency. That is the heartbeat of humanity. It is simple sociology of sanity to demand moderation, decency and justice from whoever is on a seat at every sphere; be it Obi Cubana or Bubu Cubana!\n\nGbenro Olajuyigbe is the Executive Director of Emergency & Risk Alert Initiative.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "In private and public spaces, Nigeria is being turned into a neighbourhood of chaos, with neither norms nor standards to guide an individual or corporate behaviour.\nBubu is always right- and Obi can never be wrong- the crowd are everywhere you go!\nObi Cubana buried his mother in Oba with anthills of Dollar and Naira obscenely displayed but then, legislators in the National Assembly are burying the country every day with loots from the immoral and illegal constituency projects that have become their own cesspools.\nWhat is the difference between Obi Cubana and the President who borrowed money on behalf of Nigeria and Nigerians only to deploy the loan to build a railway line to Maradi in the Niger Republic?\nIt is simple sociology of sanity to demand moderation, decency and justice from whoever is on a seat at every sphere; be it Obi Cubana or Bubu Cubana!",

          "text": "The Abia State Government has ordered an investigation into an allegation by a member of the state House of Assembly, Mr Obinna Ichita, stating that some persons are threatening his life over his political activities within the state.\n\nThe lawmaker representing Aba South State Constituency had alleged that some figures from an undisclosed political party were after his life.\n\nFollowing the allegation, a statement issued on Wednesday by the state\u2019s Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu condemned the threat saying \u201cunder the watch of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, premium has been placed on freedom of expression for all citizens of the State as well as protection of their lives and property\u201d.\n\nThe state government called on relevant security agencies in the state to thoroughly investigate the purported petition by the Lawmaker.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cIt is a well known fact that under the watch of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, premium has been placed on freedom of expression for all citizens of the State as well as protection of their lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe administration has never been and will never be associated with political killings or harassment of citizens based on their opinions and political views under the administration of Dr Okezie Ikpeazu even when such views are sometimes considered too toxic and beyond the threshold of globally acceptable standard of freedom of expression, rather the administration continues to receive accolades from within and outside the state for being the most peaceful in Nigeria with all political views and orientation accommodated.\n\n\u201cMindful of the fact that desperate politicians seeking future political redemption for non performance in office are also capable of crying wolf even where there is none, we wish to insist that the grave allegations by Ichita be expeditiously investigated in its entirety and those found culpable brought to justice. However, if on the other hand there is no substance to the allegation, we also will insist that appropriate sanctions be applied to deter those who may wish to needlessly overheat the polity by raising false alarms.\n\n\u201cIt is desperately malicious and/or a hallmark of ignorance for a state legislator to claim that a World Bank project fund of N27.4b has been \u201cpaid in full by the World Bank to the state government\u201c and insinuate possibility of misappropriation whereas the practice is for such funds to be held in a project account supervised by the Bank with contractors\u2019 payments released to them on the basis of agreed milestones and \u201cno objection certificate\u201d from the World Bank itself. It is shocking that a state legislator does not know that the state government cannot pay out ONE KOBO from that fund, even if it wishes to, without approval and concurrence by the World Bank which must have also certified work done as we do not not have direct access to the fund.\n\n\u201cFor a legislator who is not known to have passed any bill, including the one related to the said project, and whose political party, APGA, previously petitioned sundry federal agencies including the Ministry of Finance to stop the World Bank from funding the projects for the people of Aba South in particular and Abia State in general, to turn round and make maliciously false insinuations regarding the project without educating himself properly on it can only be attributed to a lack of attention to details, dereliction of duties, unsuitability for office and mischief.\n\n\u201cYet, we do not think that ignorance or incapacity should be a basis for anyone\u2019s life to be threatened hence our insistence that the security agencies in the state and elsewhere thoroughly investigate the petition and make public their findings.\n\n\u201cWith regard to the disbursement and application of the State House of Assembly appropriated Paris Club Refunds, the administration has no reason to interfere with legislative or legal reviews of the application of the Funds. We have already stated our position on that and other related issues to the effect that we do not interfere with constitutionally empowered bodies reviewing our management of the finances and other resources of the people of Abia State. Anyone found culpable in misappropriating public funds should be sanctioned according to the law while those who make false and malicious claims should also be sanctioned as appropriate.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to remind politicians that 2023 election cycle is more than 15 months away and those elected at various levels in 2019 are expected to focus on delivering dividends of democracy to the people of the state rather than engage in premature campaign activities through subterranean means and intrigues aimed at distracting the government and people of the state.\n\n\u201cWe believe that power belongs to God who alone can determine, through the people of the state, who wins or loses what position in the fullness of time. It is therefore advisable that elected leaders and politicians at all levels focus on delivering dividends of democracy so that they can have basis to ask the people for their votes when the time of political reckoning comes.\n\n\u201cAbia voters are sophisticated enough to distinguish between wild propaganda and substantive performance by those entrusted with the sacred mandate of the people to lead, and they are not about to let down their guard to be deceived with malicious allegations.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, wish to reiterate that the Government remains focused on implementing the kinetic Abia projects that have endeared her to the people and will continue to prioritize security of lives and property of all Abians within a democratically free and open environment\u201d.\n\nGov Ganduje not wicked, malicious \u2013 Buhari",

It is on record that this kind of partnership is helping to fast track the realization of SDG9 with derivable quantifiable benefits to industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging economies.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, it is particularly of interest that the African Development Bank (AfDB), in a White Paper on PPP Framework released in September 2020, was emphatic that the infrastructure gap in African countries acts as an impediment to their economic growth and development.\n\n\u201cAccording to the White Paper, the gaps impact not only the economic situation of the citizens of Africa, but also the countries\u2019 global competitiveness. The paper also estimates that poor infrastructure shaves off 2% of the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates.\n\n\u201cSuffice it to say that, the role of public-private partnership in infrastructure development in Nigeria cannot be over emphasised because an adequate, robust and functioning infrastructure is the bedrock of communal and societal development.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to meet future challenges, our industries and infrastructure must be upgraded by evolving an enduring PPP model that services all the sectors of the economy. Objectively, the high level of infrastructure deficit and its attendant effect on socio-economic development in Nigeria explains government\u2019s concern and search for an alternative means of providing infrastructure for the Nigeria\u2019s teeming population.\n\nThus, in 2005, the Federal Government established the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) with a clear objective to accelerate investment in national infrastructure through private sector funding; and to assist the Federal Government of Nigeria and its Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) to establish and implement effective Public Private Partnerships (PPP) processes. It is gratifying that state governments have also adopted variants of PPP models in order to tackle the challenge of infrastructure in their respective jurisdictions\n\nIn Nigeria, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) is particularly noted for its faith in strategic collaboration and partnership as a central principle of its stakeholders\u2019 relationship management and regulatory activities. Our daily regulatory processes are marked by consultations with a wide spectra of stakeholders as well as strategic partnering and collaboration with both private sector players and other sister public sector organisations.\n\nFollowing the liberalisation of the telecoms sector in 2001, the Commission has continue to facilitate investment inflow into the country\u2019s digital space through licensing of many private sector players, who are deploying services in different segment of the nation\u2019s telecom market. This has resulted in rollout of massive infrastructure ranging from the deployment of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) and laying of thousands of kilometres of fibre optic cables to every nooks and crannies of the country. Hence, the sector has grown significantly in investment with significant access to an array of voice, data and other kind of enterprises.\n\nThe Commission has also continued to enhance existing infrastructure through the licensing of a category of private sector players known as Infrastructure Companies (InfraCo), who are to deploy fibre optic cable on a wholesale basis across the country with broadband Point of Access (PoA) in each of the 774 Local Government Areas of the country. This InfraCo scheme is running on a PPP arrangement, where the government provides a counterpart fund as a subsidy to stimulate faster, a more robust and resilient broadband infrastructure rollout across the country.\n\nDanbatta noted that while broadband penetration in Nigeria has reached 45% at the moment, from less than 6% in 2015, there still exist access gaps which the Commission is making efforts to bridge.\n\nHe said it is noteworthy that the hitherto existing access gaps of 217 identified in the country have been reduced to 114 through increased collaboration between the Commission and stakeholders in the telecom ecosystem.\n\n\u201cHence, the InfraCo project being implemented by NCC and other similar regulatory initiatives which has PPP component are in line with policy expectations of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025; the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030; the NCC Strategic Management Plan (SMP) 2020-2024, as well as a number of regulatory instruments and frameworks which envisioned the PPP model as a central organising principle for fast-tracking the development of Nigeria\u2019s telecoms industry,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBesides, the NCC is renowned for its tradition of engaging in robust stakeholder consultation on the development of its various regulations and policy initiatives. The Commission consistently engages private sector organisations, in clear expression of its PPP philosophy, to carry out specific tasks, notably, in carrying out cost-based studies, whose outcomes have been used by the Commission to improve regulations and policy decision that have far-reaching positive implications on the economy.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also engaged in a number of PPP engagement through such initiatives as Industry Consumer Advisory Forum (ICAF), a multi-sectoral committee of private and public sector institutions whose collaboration with the Commission has bolstered Commission\u2019s determination to continually improve on all principles of protection of telecoms consumers from an array of service challenges as well as incidences of frauds and other associated risks of online transactions.\n\nThe NCC boss said that in November 2020, the Commission created a \u2018PPP Unit\u2019 as a division under its Special Duties Department to oversee the implementation of it\u2019s revenue assurance solutions (RAS) as well as the Device Management System (DMS) project which are being implemented in collaboration with private sector players.\n\nHe noted however, that despite the various PPP interventions being undertaken by the government and similar initiatives at the Commission, a number of challenges persist in the telecom ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThese include multiple taxation and regulation, Right of Way (RoW) issue, vandalism, poor electricity supply, and lately worsening insecurity. All of these factors affect both the tempo and quality of infrastructure rollout by the private sector licensees, who are the main engine of growth in the telecom sector. These challenges also affect the quality of telecom services and by extension the Quality of Experience (QoE) of telecom consumers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive of Galaxy Backbone, Prof. Muhammed Abubakar, who spoke during a webinar session titled, \u2018Cloud Service and the journey towards digital Economy\u2019 in Abuja held on Tuesday, stated that the agency is committed to customer service and the delivery of quality services to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe are very confident that through the service we have put together with ZADARA today, we assure you we will deliver on your cloud services needs.\n\n\u201cGalaxy Backbone has achieved quite a lot since its inception in 2006. Providing and deploring the infrastructure for connectivity and cloud services is what we do so well\u201d, he said.\n\nEarlier the Director General, National Information Technology Development Agency(NITDA), Abdullahi Kashifu in his Keynote Address said cloud services currently cost about $270 billion in 2020 and it is expected to increase by 23.1% per cent this year.\n\nHe explained that cloud services will bring about reduced Information Technology costs; scalability; flexibility; better security; and less time to market.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is imperative to understand that enterprises and organisations depend on the effective use of cloud technology to enhance existing business processes and deploy new business value propositions in and post COVID eras\u201d, he said.\n\nNCC to strengthen judicial collaboration in tackling telecoms service challenges",

          "title": "Self-regulation better for media, says Olorunyomi",
          "text": "By Robert Egbe\n\nPublisher/Editor-in-Chief of online newspaper, Premium Times, Mr. Dapo Olorunyomi, has said the current realities make regulation of the media a necessity.\n\nBut he proposed that such regulation should be left to the industry itself rather than to the government.\n\nOlorunyomi spoke at an anniversary lecture on the 60th birthday of the Oloriewe of Oro Kingdom in Kwara State, Alhaji Raheem Adedoyin.\n\nThe Federal Government and its lawmakers have come under fire for the promotion of Nigeria Press Council (NPC) and National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Amendment Bills, which critics say would allow authorities to control the media.\n\nBoth chambers of the National Assembly, on July 12, buckled to opposition from the public and stakeholders and suspended deliberations on the Bills. Speaking on the topic: Media, Democracy and Future of Nigeria, Olorunyomi noted that government attempts to regulate the media are not new.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey have ranged from outright bans to curtailing freedom through draconian legislations and statutes. Then states have set up agencies, like the Nigerian Press Council, to which the independent media organisations have robustly pushed back, saying peer regulation is a better option.\n\n\u201cGovernment and its agents have suggested that the absence of enforcement mechanisms make peer regulation sound like a do-nothing option.\u201d\n\nThe experienced journalist described the celebrator, Adedoyin, as a man of brilliance and hard work.\n\n\u201cEither as a reporter at The Guardian in Lagos; the Media Manager at The Herald, or Information Manager as Commissioner in his state, or even as a freedom of expression missioner through the process of the International Press Institute (IPI), Alhaji Adedoyin is a man and presence of distinction,\u201d Olorunyomi added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, as many countries today are seeing, media organisations can draft their own regulatory instrument and seek the backing of parliament to make them statutory. Such statutory regulation can help remove the scare on both sides.\n\n\u201cSo, that brings us to the essential argument: why do we need regulation today? One is that the framework of those who do journalism has expanded beyond the received notions of the pre-digital age.\n\n\u201cWe have bloggers and citizens practising journalism today. Some do far better work than established institutions because they stay faithful to the ethical imperatives of journalism\u2026\u201d Olorunyomi argued that the media is broken but remains fixable.\n\n\u201cMy contention is that it is a business model that has gone atrophy. I also argue that it can be fixed, and that the government, in so far as it believes in democracy and development, has a major role to play.\n\n\u201cSeen from this perspective, therefore, the rash of laws poured into the National Assembly in 2019 to \u2018regulate\u2019 the poor behaviour of parliament will be needless, if there is an honest purpose that what is wrong in our journalism is what they intend to fix.\n\n\u201cWe know better that this is not the case. But if you engage public officials, particularly those who are genuine about the matter, you see a genuine ignorance and probably a true desire to help with things,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "2023: Abia Charter of Equity should be respected \u2013 Eze Kalu Ogbu, Abiriba monarch",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nThe Enachioken of Abiriba Kingdom, Eze Kalu Kalu Ogbu, has called on Abia State politicians to respect the Abia Charter of Equity, signed by the founding fathers of the state on power rotation.\n\nIn an interview with Daily Sun, the monarch, who would be called to the Nigerian bar today, said, the challenges of the throne drove him to be well-adjusted and prepared for the present and the future.\n\nHow do you feel being called to the bar?\n\nI am indeed very happy to be called to the Nigerian bar. It\u2019s an honour. I give God all the glory.\n\nWhat informed your going back to school at this stage?\n\nA combination of factors led me into this academic pursuit. These include my love for education and my quest to be well informed in order to serve my people better and more effectively. Again, the challenges of the throne drove me to be well-adjusted and prepared for the present and the future.\n\nHow were you able to combine the enormous responsibilities/challenges of ruling Abiriba and the rigours of academic work?\n\nCoping was not easy at all. The challenges were enormous. But I succeeded due to my vision, dedication and hard work.\n\nAgain, my lieutenants were very helpful. They supported me in no small measure. I\u2019m grateful to HRH Eze Uche Benjamin Agu (Effa of Agboji-Abiriba), HRH Eze Eme Uguru Ikpoka (Ukpaghiri of Amogudu-Abiriba), HRH Eze Ukiwe Otisi Ukiwe (Alioke of Ihungwu \u2013 Abiriba) and all the 17 village heads of Abiriba Kingdom. They and others too numerous to mention here were very helpful each time I left the kingdom for school activities. I\u2019m eternally grateful to all of them. They are part of this success story.\n\nI also acknowledge God\u2019s grace and the support and motivation by Chief Leslie Ebueme Ezikpe (Dike Eji Ejemba of Abiriba) and Chief Jackson Agbai Abbah (Kukunda of Abiriba).\n\nWhat next, are you going into private practice or the bench?\n\nI am going into practice. I intend to contribute my quota in the area of human rights and alternative dispute resolution (ADR).\n\nMeanwhile, I will not stop in my quest for further education. I have already been admitted to pursue my master\u2019s degree in law (LLM) in Abia State University, Uturu.\n\nWith this new feat, what more should Abiriba expect?\n\nAbiriba people are also part of this story. They should expect more informed decisions from the palace in furtherance of our over 500 years\u2019 administration of justice system. They should expect more purposeful and God-fearing leadership in the kingdom.\n\nAbout 11 years ago, Abiriba was embroiled in a tussle for the throne; how were you able to unite all parties for the progress of the community?\n\nI take no glory in what is happening now in Abiriba. We as a people return all the glory to the Most High God. He is our God and we trust him always.\n\nThere was a time Abiriba indigenes had a good percentage of industries in Aba. What are your plans to make Abiriba people think home towards industrializing the community so that, if a state were created, your people would not find their investments in another state that may not be friendly to them?\n\nWe recall with nostalgia the glorious years of industrialisation in Abia State championed by Abiriba people. In spite of the current challenges, we still have a crop of young entrepreneurs that are prepared to continue the legacies.\n\nTo bring some of these industries back home to improve the economic fortunes of the kingdom is a work in progress. The discussion is on the front burners of current issues in Abiriba and we believe that something more visible will be seen in this direction.\n\nAmong its neighbouring communities, Abiriba seems to be the only community whose rich cultural heritage and traditional values have not been very much eroded. Why?\n\nIt\u2019s very true that we have held to our cultural heritage and traditional values for more than 500 years. Within this period, it has been a running battle with modernity in various ways.\n\nHowever, we have sustained these values through the instrumentality of two major institutional frame works, to wit: Age grade system and the matrilineal system. Today, unfortunately, these two systems are under intense attack by enemies of the kingdom, within and outside. It\u2019s indeed the last fight and we shall conquer. But a lot of work is required for us to maintain a sustainable tradition and custom in the kingdom.\n\nWhy is Abiriba nicknamed, \u2018Small London\u2019?\n\nThe name, \u2018Small London\u2019 was given to us by the Great Zik of Africa, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe (Owelle of Onitsha). This happened in the 1950s, when he visited Abiriba on a campaign trail. He was pressed and requested to ease himself. He was shown a convenience room. When he got there, to his surprise, it was a water cistern.\n\nHe immediately recalled that it was only in London that he had seen a similar cistern. In awe, for seeing such in a place like Abiriba at the time, he openly called Abiriba \u2018Small London\u2019. This is the thread of history behind the name.\n\nWhat is it that makes Abiriba people successful in every endeavour, especially in trade and commerce?\n\nAbiriba is a kingdom of great entrepreneurs. It\u2019s really in our DNA.\n\nBy 1752, Abiriba as a people had already developed a guild of blacksmiths. They were known to have produced several implements like hoes, knives and machetes. This was achieved through the \u2018Nkuma Asaa of Abiriba Kingdom.\n\nSince then, Abiriba people have produced several entrepreneurs in all areas of trade and commerce. This entrepreneurial spirit from our forebears is at the root of our success stories. And it is sustained by the guild system, the age grade system and mentorship scheme introduced by our fathers. This combination has remained effective in sustaining the success stories in this regard.\n\nAre you not worried over the security in the country, and what is your solution to the problem?\n\nThe security challenges in the country are a bad omen. I have made my position known in a number of fora. The government needs to step up in this direction. To start with, they need to be proactive in dealing with security issues in the country. Secondly, violent criminals and terrorists should be called what they are to be treated accordingly. There is no need in giving them baptismal names of bandits, herdsmen or unknown gunmen.\n\nThen again, it is very helpful and important that the President and leaders of the country should not be speaking from both sides of the mouth. Finally, I suggest to the Nigerian government that this is a time for dialogue and not the time of acting tough. Let us jaw-jaw, instead of war-war.\n\nThere is said to be Abia Charter of Equity on rotation of governorship in the state. For 2023, which area should produce the governor?\n\nAbia State is built on a strong and sustainable foundation of equity. Anybody that has the love of the state at heart must not be seen to do anything that will touch on this foundation negatively. Our political class should be careful not to do anything that will directly or indirectly affect this foundation.\n\nThe Abia Charter of Equity has served us well and I therefore align my self with the position of many elder statesmen like Ezeogo Dr. Anagha Ezikpe.\n\nSince the inception of the current democratic dispensation, Abia State has been peaceful. The governorship position has rotated among the senatorial zones in an unwritten gentleman\u2019s agreement. This started with Abia North, then to Abia Central and finally Abia South.\n\nSince the three zones have taken their turns, it is important that it starts again from Abia North. This is the sensible thing to do for the enduring peace that have prevailed in the state to continue.\n\nI believe in our political class. They will not like to upset the peace in the state. They will do the right thing at the right time. God bless Abia State, the God\u2019s Own State.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nBenin Republic government has filed fresh charges, including illegal migration to the country, dubious connivance with immigration officers and attempt to cause civil unrest, against Yoruba nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, before Palaise Du Justice, Court D\u2019Appal, in Cotonou.\n\nOne of the counsels to Igboho, Ibrahim Salami, made this known,yesterday, in an interview with British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Yoruba service in Cotonou.\n\nSalami said the nine-man legal team that appeared before the court on Monday to defend Igboho were surprised that fresh charges were brought against him by the Beninese government, while the three charges from Nigeria were dropped.\n\n\u201cFirst, the judge ruled that Sunday Igboho entered into Benin Republic through an illegal means. They also want to investigate how Sunday Igboho conspired with others to enter Benin Republic through wrong means. They also want to know how long he has been in Benin Republic and his plans in the country. They also raised a charge on whether he wants to come and cause unrest or social disturbance in Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nSalami said trials in Beninese courts usually follow three stages. The first stage, he said, is with the prosecutor, who is a judge, while the second stage is with a judge that will investigate the case. The third stage, he said is with the judge that would determine whether the accused person should be put in prison custody or not pending the determination of the case.\n\nHe said the three initial allegations against Igboho that were argued at the first two stages of the trail bordered on gunrunning and stockpiling of arms to cause war in Nigeria, while the second allegation had to do with inciting people to destabilise Nigeria. The third allegation, he said, was based on purported moves by Igboho to break up Nigeria into two or three countries.\n\nSalami said it was a surprise to the legal team to note that other allegations were brought against Igboho at the third stage.\n\nHe said with the new development, Igboho now has a case with the government of Benin Republic, revealing that Nigeria neither filed any charge against Igboho, nor was it represented at the court proceedings on Monday in Cotonou.\n\nThe judge at the third stage, according to Salami, was the one that ruled that Igboho should be remanded in prison custody pending the conclusion of investigation into the fresh charges brought against him by Benin Republic.\n\nHe said the case against Igboho has not reached the final determination stage, as the legal team would have to go back to the judge at the second stage to know the adjournment date. Salami said the fresh allegations against Igboho are serious crimes in Benin Republic.\n\nHe said Igboho sustained injury when he jumped the perimeter fence of his house to escape the raid on his house on July 1, 2021, adding that the injury prevented him to stand up for a long time in the court on Monday. He said he was given a chair to sit on, while the trial was ongoing, and that he would require medical attention.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Nigerian serial fraudster, Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi, has agreed to plead guilty to the money laundering charge against him.\n\nHushpuppi, who is known for his luxury lifestyle, was arrested in the UAE in June 2020 alongside 11 of his associates over allegations bordering on hacking, impersonation, scamming, banking fraud, and identity theft.\n\nThe fraudster's extradition to the US was effected after the UAE police detailed his arrest in a special operation dubbed \u2018Fox Hunt 2\u2019 where he was accused of defrauding 1.9 million victims to the tune of N168 billion.\n\nHushpuppi was arraigned and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in Chicago ahead of his trial.\n\nIn the court file signed by Loius Shapiro, Hushpuppi\u2019s lawyer, on behalf of the defendant agreed to give up the right to indictment by a grand jury and plead guilty to count two of the trial \u201cCase No. 2:20-CR-00322-ODW.\u201d\n\nNigerian Serial Fraudster, Hushpuppi Pleads Guilty To Money Laundering Charge, May Spend Up To 20 Years In Jail.pdf\n\nThe referenced court case, it is understood, charges Hushpuppi with \u201cconspiracy to engage in money laundering.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a person to be deemed guilty of the crime, there was an agreement between two or more persons to conduct a financial transaction involving property that represented the proceeds of wire fraud,\" the document reads.\n\nIt also added that the defendant must have known that the funds were \u201cproceeds of some form of unlawful activity\u201d and the transaction was designed \u201cto conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds.\u201d\n\nJournalist Evan Ratiff who shared copies of the agreement revealed that Hushpuppi now faces up to 20 years in prison at sentencing.\n\nThe agreement he entered is limited to United States Attorney's Office and not binding to other federal, state, local or foreign prosecuting authorities.\n\nHe will henceforth not contest facts entered in the agreement and abide by all agreements regarding sentencing.\n\nHushpuppi is also expected to be truthful at all times with the United States probation and pretrial services office and the court.\n\nThe Instagram celebrity will pay close to $1.7m as restitution, but this can change based on facts that come up before sentencing.\n\n\u201cThe defendant understands that the statutory maximum sentence that the court can impose for a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h), as charged in the Information, is: 20 years imprisonment,\u201d the file read.\n\n\u201c\u2026a 3-year period of supervised release; a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the\n\noffense, whichever is greatest; and a mandatory special assessment of $100.\n\n\u201cDefendant understands that defendant will be required to pay full restitution to the victim(s) of the offense to which defendant is pleading guilty.\n\n\u201cDefendant agrees that the court may order restitution to persons other than the victim(s) of the offenses to which defendant is pleading guilty and in amounts greater than those alleged in the count.\u201d",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why CBN is banning forex sales to BDCs in Nigeria",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses.

The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise money and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal is to build the Tesla of Africa.\u201d\n\nThese were the words of Rupani Sanjay, Nigerian automobile company, JET Motor Company\u2019s Director of Sales and Marketing, in an interview with Techpoint Africa in 2020, when the company announced its $9m raise to build Africa\u2019s first all-electric vehicle.\n\nA little more than a year later, in June 2021, the company announced its partnership with Nigerian logistics giant, GIG Logistics (GIGL), to launch the country\u2019s first electric cargo van, JET EV.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Chidi Ajaere, Chairman, GIG Group, and a team of automobile experts, JET Motor Company\u2019s mission is to lead Africa into a new era of mobility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has now launched JET EV, the first locally made, fully electric vehicle to run on the Nigerian road, with zero emissions.\n\nIf you attended Techpoint Inspired in 2019, you probably remember Joseph Wemimo, Director of Strategy and Operations at JET, introducing JET Mover, the company\u2019s first product.\n\nThe JET EV\n\nAfter about three years of research, testing, and iterative development, the company has finally achieved its primary goal \u2014 to produce electric vehicles from the start.\n\nAccording to Ebuka Uchendu, Technical Lead, JET EV, the vehicle can travel 260-280km on a full charge, although it can technically do 300km. With the EV, he says, the number of engine parts reduces by almost 70%, thereby cutting maintenance costs. Operational costs \u2014 issues such as refuelling \u2014 also drop significantly.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the cost of fueling a vehicle for 250km, you will see that using an EV costs less to maintain. For example, looking at the current billing charges from electric companies, you will see that you can charge the EV to full charge with \u20a66,000 while fueling a vehicle now in Nigeria for 250km will cost between \u20a610,000 and \u20a615,000,\u201d Uchendu says.\n\nThe EV has a high capacity lithium-ion phosphate battery rated at 107.6kwh, a traction motor with a larger torque of 950Nm, making it possible for the vehicle to accelerate from 0-100km/h in under 20 seconds.\n\nIt also comes with a supercharger that can fully charge a dead 107.6kwh SOC (state of charge) in less than 2 hours.\n\nThe African experience\n\nBut there are questions regarding the high cost of entry and epileptic power supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAjaere says that as their partnership with GIGL indicates, the initial targets are fleet operators \u2014 transport companies like ABC and GIG Mobility, as well as schools and governments.\n\n\u201cFleet operators tend to lose a lot over a period of time. So even though your initial cost of entry might be high, if you think about it as a fleet operator who has 10 or 20 vehicles, two major costs would be maintaining those vehicles and the cost of petrol.\n\n\u201cBut with the EV, you practically reduce that cost by literally 100% because you are not using petroleum and your maintenance cost is almost zero. So in terms of maintenance over a long and short period of time, EVs are better, but the initial cost of entry is higher,\u201d Ajaere concludes.\n\nAs to the power supply issue, he says, each fleet operator has alternative sources to choose from, such as solar, wind power, and diesel.\n\n\u201cSay I am a fleet operator, and I own 20 fuel-powered vehicles,\u201d Ajaere adds, \u201cI have to put petrol in those vehicles. But if I have a 100KVA generator, for example, all I have to do is power it and charge my fleet. Even if I am emitting CO2 via my diesel-powered engine, I am only doing that via my diesel engine. I don\u2019t have 20 vehicles on the road polluting the road. The point is that you can charge your vehicle through any power source.\u201d\n\nBut the company is already building charging stations for its partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA charging station\n\n\u201cWith the partners we already have, what we are doing is that as they acquire the fleet, we are actually building these stations for them to fit in with their mobility needs.\u201d\n\nHowever, the long-term goal is that as JET attracts more partners and funding from VCs, it will build solar or wind-powered stations across the board.\n\nThere are several players in the African EV industry. Apart from JET in Nigeria, Siltech builds electric bikes, patrol vehicles, and even utility vehicles for the agricultural sector.\n\nIn Kenya, ARC Ride has launched two and three-wheelers which companies like Uber Eats and Kibanda Top Up use for deliveries. In Rwanda, Ampersand has introduced a fleet of electric motorcycle taxis, operating as an Uber of sorts while maintaining ownership of the vehicles.\n\nIn Uganda, Kiira Motors, which has built electric buses and cars since 2011, already ply the country\u2019s roads.\n\nDespite these strides, Africa is still grossly underrepresented. Ajaere believes JET Motor Company is excellently positioned to turn this around with its vehicles specifically designed for the continent\u2019s bad roads and humid temperatures.\n\nNigeria\u2019s automotive industry, much like the fintech space, has had its fair share of interesting policies and Ajaere once again echoes his thoughts on the policy outlook in Africa.\n\n\u201cYou can have great ideas, but every great company had funding and good policies that incentivised them to make these vehicles easily accessible.\n\n\u201cIf countries like Ghana and Nigeria have favourable policies, over time we should be able to export these vehicles not only within Africa but within the decade or next, move across the shores of Africa,\u201d Ajaere concludes.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo words: African dominance. And the company is looking for funding from VCs and angel investors with a similar mindset and interest in the renewable energy space.\n\nAway from that, while JET Motor Company is currently focused on the mass transportation space, it plans to build passenger lines.\n\nThere are also plans to innovate in the battery swapping technology space.\n\n\u201cOur plan for expansion is to rapidly get the right funding and literally plant charging stations across African cities and African highways, making it easier for both individuals and corporations to adopt the EV because they are more likely to buy an EV if they know they can have access to charging stations,\u201d Ajaere says.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The 11 cities include Rivers, Edo, Kaduna, Kano, Enugu, Delta and Kwara States in Nigeria, and Eldoret, Mombasa, Kisumu and Naivasha in Kenya.\n\nThe expansion will build on Field Intelligence\u2019s existing 700+ pharmacy membership, which has served over 1.4 million patients to accelerate quality frontline healthcare across Africa. This comes after a year in which the company claims to have seen rapid growth in sales and Shelf Life membership.\n\nFounded in 2015, the startup digitises the pharmaceutical supply chain. In its early days, it was focused on solving supply chain issues in Nigeria\u2019s capital city but co-founder and CEO, Michael Moreland disclosed that they soon found that privately run pharmacies faced the same challenges.\n\nTo solve that problem, Field Intelligence moved from being a software company to a tech-enabled pharmaceutical distributor launching Shelf Life in 2017 for that purpose.\n\nSpeaking on the expansion, Moreland revealed that \u201cShelf Life\u2019s rapid uptake across such a range of African markets is a testament to its potential as a solution for pharmacies across the continent.\n\n\u201cRural and urban, East and West, we have found Shelf Life helping pharmacies overcome a shared set of challenges and seize new opportunities for growth by improving access for their patients. The ability of our technology to digitise, automate, and optimise planning, assortment, and fulfillment, led by an incredible team, is quickly making Shelf Life one of the largest retail pharmacy supply chains in Africa.\u201d\n\nAlthough Field Intelligence maintains that Shelf Life is currently being used by more than 700 pharmacies in Nigeria and Kenya, the startup has its sights trained on the over 20,000 drugstores and pharmacies in Nigeria and Kenya. By 2022, it aims to have at least 2000 pharmacies and drugstores using Shelf Life and 12,000 by 2025.\n\nMuch of Africa\u2019s healthcare systems are manually handled leaving businesses with a mountain to climb if they are to stay on top of their processes. With solutions like Field Intelligence, pharmacies can now digitise their processes enabling them to run efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "One month after full deployment of the electronic call-up system in Tin-Can Island Port, the cost of transporting containers from the same port to warehouses in Lagos has declined by 50 percent, BusinessDay has learnt.\n\nPresently, it cost about N700,000 to lift a 40-foot container from Tin-Can Port to warehouses in Lagos compared with late last year and earlier in the year, when importers paid as much as N1.4 million to lift the same size of container to anywhere in Lagos.\n\nThe implementation of electronic call-up systems in Lagos Ports, Apapa, and Tin-Can Island Ports, has brought in slight ease in cargo evacuation as truckers presently spend fewer days to access the port terminals.\n\nFindings shows that movement in and out of Apapa has improved significantly in recent weeks as more trucks now make use of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) approved truck parks and pre-gate facilities, while less number of trucks queue on bridges and roads within Apapa and environment waiting to access the port.\n\nAlso, the electronic call-up system was fully deployed to terminals in Tin-Can Ports including Crown Flour Mills, Josepdam Port, Tin-Can Island Container Terminal, Ports and Cargo, PTML, and Five Star Logistics, on May 31, 2021, three months after the introduction of electronic call-up in Apapa Port.\n\nRead also: Apapa: Why truckers lose N100m daily to extortion despite call-up system\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to the decline in cost of transportation, cargo owners are beginning to experience a slight relief as the amount paid to shipping companies as demurrage for delays in taking delivery of their consignments continues to drop as well.\n\nConfirming this, Tony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Link Investment Limited, says that loading a 40-foot container from Tin-Can Island to warehouses in Lagos now costs about N700,000 while transporters charge about N350,000 to load a 20-foot container from the same port.\n\nAccording to Anakebe, the cost of transportation is almost the same in Apapa Port, as importers pay between N500,000 and N700,000 to move a 40-foot container from Apapa Port to any warehouse in Lagos.\n\nOn the road construction, Anakebe, who spoke on a phone interview, states that some part of the Tin-Can area of Apapa-Oshodi Expressway has been constructed, but the road has not been to use while construction works on the Mile 2 bound axis is yet to commence.\n\nHe attributed the improvement in movement of trucks and decline in cost of transportation to the deployment of an electronic call-up system in the Tin-Can Port.\n\nHe however discloses that several efforts are on to jeopardise the use and effectiveness of the electronic call-up system by some self-serving security personnel in charge of traffic control in Apapa.\n\nAdedenuola Orimolade, operations manager, Trucks Transit Parks Limited, says the implementation of the ETO call-up system has in addition to ensuring movement of trucks in and out Apapa, resulted in decline of haulage rates.\n\n\u201cThere has been almost 30 percent to 40 percent reduction in haulage rates as it now takes about N500,000 to N600,000 to move containers from Tin-Can Island Ports to warehouses in Lagos. This is a great improvement when compared to sometime in December 2020 and earlier in the year, when importers pay as much as N1.4 million as haulage rate from Tin-Can to Ikeja,\u201d Orimolade states in an interview with BusinessDay.\n\nRecall that the cost of container haulage from Tin-Can Island Ports escalated in the last quarter of 2020 all through to early this year, when the bad state of roads in Apapa started taking toll on truckers by reducing the number of trips embarked on by truck owners. Then, truckers spent as long as 30 days on one trip due to the perennial gridlock on Apapa roads.\n\nIn addition, truckers\u2019 operational costs in terms of fuel consumption and maintenance also increased due to impact of bad roads on their vehicles as well as payment of unauthorised tolls to security operatives before having access to the port to offload empty containers.",

          "text": "Nigerian Instagram celebrity, Ramon Abass, has finally agreed to plead guilty to the multi-million-dollar fraud charges filed against him by the United States government.\n\nArrested in Dubai, the United Arab Emirate (UAE) in June 2020, and subsequently extradited to the U.S. where most of the victims of his alleged fraudulent activities are based, Mr Abass has spent the last one year in custody maintaining his innocence.\n\nHowever, with the commencement of his trial around the corner, Mr Abass has now made a volte-face, entering into a plea bargain agreement with the U.S. government in the hope of getting a lighter punishment.\n\nHe will now be pleading guilty to Count Two which is \u201cConspiracy to Engage in Money Laundering,\u201d an offence that attracts a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment among other punishments including full restitution, his plea agreement with the U.S. government states in part.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES on Wednesday obtained a copy of the plea bargain agreement between him and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California (USAO).\n\nSigned by Hushpuppi, his lawyer, Louis Shapiro, and the Assistant United States Attorney, Anil Antony, on July 4, the plea agreement was filed at a U.S. Central District Court of California on Tuesday.\n\nA date is to be fixed for Mr Abass to change his previous \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea to \u201cguilty\u201d and will be followed by a sentencing hearing for the judge to determine how long he will spend in jail.\n\n\u2018Earliest opportunity to plead guilty\u2019\n\nThe next stage after the filing of the agreement is that Mr Abass will, \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d appear and plead guilty to Count Two of the Information\u201d.\n\nOther terms of the agreement include the defendant\u2019s concession to \u201cnot contest facts agreed to in this agreement,\u201d the document states.\n\nHe has also agreed to \u201cabide by all agreements regarding sentencing contained in this agreement.\u201d\n\nHe concedes that \u201call court appearances, including his change of plea hearing and sentencing hearing, may proceed by video-teleconference (VTC) or telephone, if VTC is not reasonably available, so long as such appearances are authorized by Order of the Chief Judge 20-043 or another order, rule, or statute\u201d.\n\nThe court will conduct a sentencing hearing after Hushpuppi changes his plea from guilty to not guilty.\n\nHe has consented \u201cunder Section 15002(b) of the CARES Act to proceed with his sentencing hearing by VTC or telephone, if VTC is not reasonably available.\u201d\n\nHe will also \u201cAppear for all court appearances, surrender as ordered for service of sentence, obey all conditions of any bond, and obey any other ongoing court order in this matter.\u201d\n\nAlso listed as part of the terms of the agreement is Hushpuppi\u2019s concession not to commit crime again.\n\nHe has also conceded to \u201cBe truthful at all times with the United States Probation and Pretrial Services Office and the Court. \u201c\n\n\u2018Full restitution despite guilty plea\u2019\n\nMr Abass will not be exempted from paying restitution despite pleading guilty.\n\n\u201cDefendant understands that defendant will be required to pay full restitution to the victim(s) of the offence to which defendant is pleading guilty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cDefendant agrees that, in return for the USAO\u2019s compliance with its obligations under this agreement, the court may order restitution to persons other than the victim(s) of the offenses to which defendant is pleading guilty and in amounts greater than those alleged in the count to which defendant is pleading guilty,\u201d the plea agreement also read.\n\n\u2018Right of appeal waived\u2019\n\nThe agreement also stipulates that with the exception of an appeal based on a claim that his guilty plea was involuntary, he will be \u201cwaiving and giving up any right to appeal\u201d against his conviction on the offence to which defendant is pleading guilty.\n\nSentence\n\nThe exact sentence to be imposed on Mr Abass was not agreed on.\n\nHowever, provided that he \u201cdemonstrates an acceptance of responsibility for the offence up to and including the time of sentencing,\u201d the prosecution said it recommends \u201ca two-level reduction in the applicable Sentencing Guidelines offence level\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf necessary,\u201d the prosecution adds, it may \u201cmove for an additional one-level reduction if available under that section.\u201d\n\nNot being an American citizen, he will be deported after completing his jail term and paying up the amount to be restituted.\n\nThe maximum penalty for the offence which Mr Abass hopes will be reduced at his sentencing include: \u201c20 years\u2019 imprisonment; a 3-year period of supervised release; a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the offense, whichever is greatest; and a mandatory special assessment of $100.\u201d\n\nDetails of offence\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California states in the agreement that beginning no later than on or about January 18, 2019, through on or about June 9, 2020, Hushpuppi \u201cknowingly combined, agreed, and conspired with multiple other persons (\u201cco-conspirators\u201d) to conduct financial transactions into, within, and outside the United States involving property that represented the proceeds of wire fraud.\u201d\n\nThe co-conspirators, according to USAO, targeted multiple victims and laundered and/or attempted to launder funds fraudulently obtained, and attempted to be fraudulently obtained, through bank cyber-heists, business email compromise (BEC) frauds, and other fraud schemes.\n\nThe intended victims of the conspiracy were said to include a foreign financial institution (which was a bank in Malta), the victim\u2019s law firm (located in New York State), and two companies located in the United Kingdom.\n\nMr Abass was said to have known that \u201cthese fraudulent schemes included bank cyber-heists, BEC schemes, and other fraud schemes.\u201d\n\nThe foreign financial institution (a bank in Malta) was an intended victim of a cyber-heist, while the other victims identified above were victims of BEC schemes.\n\nIn some BEC schemes involving victim companies in the United Kingdom, Mr Abass was said to have with one co-conspirator discussed on May 12, 2019, how they anticipated fraudulent payments of approximately \u00a36 million per week.\n\n\u201cOnce a victim deposited funds into a bank account, defendant would coordinate with other coconspirators to obtain or move the funds, and then to further launder the funds,\u201d the U.S. government said.\n\nIn addition to admitting defendant\u2019s involvement in the schemes intending to defraud the victims listed above, Mr Abass was also said to have admitted involvement in a scheme to defraud a victim company in Qatar that was building an international school (the Qatari Victim Company) and the owner of that company.\n\nHe was also said to have in December 2019, begun conspiring with a co-conspirator to defraud the owner of the Qatari company \u201cwho was seeking a lender to invest $15,000,000 in a project to build an international school\u201d.\n\nMr Abass\u2019 alleged co-conspirator was said to have already defrauded the victim of funds at the time that the defendant joined the scheme.\n\n\u201cBeginning on or around December 11, 2019, defendant began to communicate with the Victim Businessperson, fraudulently using the name Malik,\u201d it was stated.\n\nAs Malik, the prosecution said further, Huspuppi falsely told the victim that he would open a bank account in the United States where the $15,000,000 loan could initially be deposited.\n\n\u201cIn truth, defendant and Coconspirator A did not intend to assist the Victim Businessperson in securing a loan; they were defrauding the Victim Businessperson,\u201d the prosecution alleged.\n\nArrest\n\nEarlier in June 2020, the 38-year-old known for flaunting his opulent lifestyle on social media was arrested in Dubai by special agents including the Emerati police officers and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operatives.\n\nThe FBI stated in an affidavit obtained by PREMIUM TIMES that its investigations revealed that Mr Abbas financed this extravagant lifestyle with proceeds of crime.",

Therefore, the Ministry had to award the Contract for additional works to Messrs RCC Nigeria Limited to upgrade the Portharcourt Onne Port Junction.\n\n\u201cThe initial design for interchange bridges at Onne Junction is to be substituted with a flyover bridge due to space constraints caused by the newly constructed Power Sub-Station which cannot be relocated due to higher cost implication Interchange Bridge initially designed for Refinery Junction.\n\n\u201cNew flyover bridge has been designed for Akpajo intersection (Km. 4+975) The scope of works includes and is not limited to; Widening the road from 2-lane dual carriage to a 3-lane dual carriageway; Increasing the thickness of the asphalt layer; Constructing interchange bridges at Refinery and Onne Port Junction to smoothen traffic flow; Constructing a new 51 m long reinforced concrete bridge on Port Harcourt- bound carriageway at Aleto; Construction of a 128 m and 168 m long deck-on-pile bridges at Km.59+500 and Km.61+000,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further stated that due to poor annual budgetary provisions, the contract for upgrading of Section IIIA awarded in 2014 could not commence until the ministry paid the contractors the full mobilization advance in 2020. Hence, the condition of the road deteriorated during the period of delay and there has been serious encroachment on the right-of-way initially delineated for the road.",

          "text": "A Kaduna State High Court has freed the embattled leader of the proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife.\n\nIn a ruling that lasted over eight hours, the presiding judge, Justice Gideon Kurada upheld the no-case submission filed by Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife in an alleged culpable homicide, unlawful assembly and disruption of public peace levelled against them by the Kaduna state government.\n\nThe judge in his ruling held that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against the defendants.\n\nREAD ALSO: Supreme Court Upholds Akeredolu\u2019s Victory\n\nThe duo has been standing trial for four years on an eight-count charge of alleged culpable homicide, disruption of public peace and unlawful Assembly among others levelled against them by the Kaduna State Government.\n\nThe defendants were brought to court on Wednesday morning by officials of the Nigerian Correctional service amidst tight security.\n\nTheir lead counsel and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Femi Falana, had on July 1, argued that all the 15 witnesses presented by the prosecution counsel were unable to establish any connection between the alleged crimes of Sheikh El-Zakzaky and his wife.\n\nFalana then prayed the court to rule in favour of his clients and dismiss the charges levelled against them as there was no criminal case that has been established against them so far by the Kaduna State Government.\n\nLong, Contentious Trial\n\nFollowing El-Zakzaky\u2019s arrest by the military on December 13, 2015, the IMN leader had experienced what may be described as a long contentious trial.\n\nHe marked his first appearance on May 15, 2018 where he was arraigned before a Kaduna High Court amidst tight security.\n\nThe Department of Security Services (DSS) had held the Shiite leader in detention despite a court order ordering his release.\n\nHowever, the DSS complied with the court order and freed El-Zakzky who proceeded to India for medical treatment.\n\nEl-Zakzaky and his wife left Nigeria in August 2019 for India following a ruling of the Kaduna State High Court which granted them permission to be treated in the country.\n\nOn their arrival at the hospital where treatment was expected to commence, the trip turned controversial.\n\nUpon his return to Nigeria in August 2019, he, alongside his wife were taken into custody, four days after they travelled to the Asian country.",

You don\u2019t have to win a medal. Watching you play is enough for all your fans,\u201d said Yuji Taida, a novelist.\n\nJapanese media relayed urgent reports on her loss, with \u201cmasaka\u201d in the headlines.\n\n\u201cHer mother\u2019s motherland. Her dream to stand at the pinnacle, with the rising sun on her heart, was not to be,\u201d reported Sports Hochi, a Japanese daily sports newspaper.\n\nThe stock of Japanese tennis racket maker Yonex, one of her major corporate sponsors, plunged Tuesday, just as she lost to former French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-4 in the third round. The stock recouped some of the losses but ended down 1.8%.\n\nThe disappointment came just four days after Osaka left the nation teary-eyed by running up a Mount Fuji-like set at the National Stadium and lighting the Olympic cauldron with her torch to open the Olympics.\n\nFor many here, the Japan-born Osaka, whose father is Haitian, has grown to personify a ray of hope for diversity in a nation long linked with discrimination and intolerance for differences. \u201cUndoubtedly the greatest athletic achievement and honor I will ever have in my life,\u201d Osaka had written on Instagram about her role in her first Olympics. Some Japanese said it broke their hearts to imagine how much Osaka had wanted to win the gold for her country. \u201cShe has her principles about her pride for Japan, and playing for Japan, while also being proud of her diverse roots in having a Haitian father and living in the U.S.,\u201d said lawyer Atusko Nishiyama, who was already starting to worry Osaka might get attacked for her loss. Nishiyama said she had been impressed by Osaka\u2019s statements on Black Lives Matter, such as last year when she wore masks bearing names of black people who had been killed. \u201cCompared to her courage, it is so sad some people are still at a very low level,\u201d Nishiyama said. While news reports speculated whether it hurt her not to play for two months and referred to how Osaka had talked about her bouts with depression and then sat out Wimbledon, Japan\u2019s response was overwhelmingly one of doting love.",
