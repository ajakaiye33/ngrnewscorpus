We just saw the Fulani man coming towards us. Next thing, he shot my direction, I dodged,\n\n\u201cHe was now asking, where is that my brother. He followed him and shot him two times. My brother fell. We didn\u2019t do anything to him,\u201d he lamented.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a relative of the disease, Confidence Wellington, noted that the residents who are mainly farmers were now afraid of going to their farmlands as a result of the incident.\n\n\u201cFulani herdsmen have been threatening us and our farmlands. If my people have farmlands of letting me say 200 kilometres, Fulani herdsmen have taken over 107 kilometres.\n\n\u201cIf you go into the bush where my people, elders, our mothers are farming, these herdsmen will threaten them and chase them out. Now they have killed my younger brother. So, we are begging the state government to help us, chase away these herdsmen from our community and protect us,\u201d Wellington said.\n\nThe Youth President of the Egbeda community, Ifeanyi Ezeocha condemned the incident and urged the people not to take laws into their hands.\n\nEzeocha said: \u201cWe are law-abiding citizens. We don\u2019t want to take laws into our hands. We have reported the activities of the Fulani herdsmen to the police, DSS (Department of State Services).\n\n\u201cEven the Commissioner of Police is aware of what they have been doing here. Now our mothers and fathers are scared of going to the farm because of what just happened. Nobody knows who will be the next. We don\u2019t have any problem with them. They have been grazing in our farmlands. Sometimes they destroy all the crops in our farms with their cows.\n\n\u201cLet the state government and security agencies come to our aid because we cannot continue like this,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, spokesman of the state police command, SP. Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident, noting the matter was under investigation.\n\nOmoni said: \u201cThe CP (Commissioner of Police) has ordered an investigation into it with a view to unravel what happened and bring anyone found culpable to justice. We have been able to restore normalcy. So for now we have asked all the parties to sheath their swords and await the outcome of our investigation,\u201dOmoni stated.\u201d",

          "text": "By Chinyere Okoroafor\n\nThe Presidency on Sunday described threats by Niger Delta Avengers to resume blow-up of oil pipelines if the substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) was not inaugurated among other demands as unnecessary.\n\nSpecial Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Femi Adesina, in a statement said the demands of the militant group have been addressed by Buhari in a meeting with newly elected leaders of Ijaw National Council and other Niger Delta stakeholders, who visited him in his office in Abuja over the weekend.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe media was Sunday awash with threats and demands by a group, Niger Delta Avengers, to embark on economic sabotage through the bombing of critical oil and gas installations unless certain demands, including the development of the Niger Delta, and restructuring of the Federation, were met.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\n\u201cFor clarity and record purposes, below is full text of the speech by President Buhari on Friday, June 25, 2021, which renders any sabre-rattling rather unnecessary:\n\n\u201cI warmly welcome all the Elders of the Niger Delta and particularly the National Executive of the Ijaw National Congress, under the leadership of Professor Benjamin Okaba. I thank you for paying this courtesy visit not too long after your election in April, and swearing-in last May.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate you all for your election and to add that a lot of responsibility is placed on your shoulders, especially coming from the fact that the Ijaw National Congress was almost without leadership for some time.\n\n\u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people-oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten-point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for the creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid-down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\nREAD ALSO: Niger Delta Avengers returns with Operation Humble to cripple economy\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d",

He noted that all the aspirants were given everything they needed by the Primary Election Committee but some were angry that they could not hijack the whole process hence the resort to blackmail and cheap propaganda.\n\nOn the purported outburst of the Publicity Secretary of APC in Anambra State, Okelo Madukaife against the conduct of the primary, the campaign organization cautioned party officials against taking positions that were inimical to the party\u2019s unity.\n\nThe statement called on well-meaning members of the APC to maintain confidence in the Gov.

          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nUS-based Nigerian singer/songwriter, Jemeriye Adeniji has performed across the globe. Recently, she played at the 70th birthday shindig of Mrs Nike Okundaye, proprietress of Nike Arts Gallery, which held at Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nAdeniji, whose Ewa Global Initiative showcases the beauty of Africa, in this interview dwells on her kind of man, among other issues. Enjoy it.\n\nWhat is the difference between being an artiste in the US and an artiste in Nigeria?\n\nI live in Pennsylvania. So, between the United States and Nigeria, we have some similarities and we have some differences. Music in Nigeria is different from music in the US. Their experiences and struggles are pretty different from each other. If you are not sure of yourself, or you are confused of your art, you\u2019ll get lost in the American system. For music, the more original you are, the better for you. The more original you are, the more they appreciate you. Americans celebrate what makes you tick; they embrace you when you are real. We have access to some things (in America) that we don\u2019t have access to here in Nigeria. As an artiste, you don\u2019t need to be a millionaire to own a stage. If you are good and you know what you do, you will be celebrated and appreciated when you stay true to your art. You will be seen and noticed. It is not about \u2018man know man\u2019 as it is here. Americans appreciate originality and sometimes you can have access to grants that could take your work to different level if you have good network.\n\nYou dress all covered up unlike most American artistes, what informed your style of dressing?\n\nFor me, you dress the way you want to be addressed. Dressing for me depends on how I feel. I want some respect and if I feel like dressing up, I dress up.\n\nWhat would you say about female artistes who show cleavages?\n\nThe truth is sex sells. Sometimes the struggle is real. Some of them believe if they are not dressed like that they won\u2019t be noticed or even heard. If your art has to do with the way you dress, be creative about it. Keep some decency to yourself, if you can. I don\u2019t want to knock anybody\u2019s hustles because I don\u2019t know what works for you. If exposing your body has helped you get to where you are going, merry Christmas and good luck. I don\u2019t like to knock anybody\u2019s hustles; it\u2019s a big market. If you think what you do is pleasant, keep it up. Like I said, I don\u2019t want to knock anybody\u2019s hustle.\n\nWhat\u2019s your kind of guy?\n\nI like smart men. Not too smart, though, not the type that wants to be in my nose that I can\u2019t even breathe. I like a man who is smart and disciplined. I like a God-fearing man, a man who appreciates and feels confident in his own woman and also in himself. I don\u2019t like a man who tries to control me and judge everything I do, and act like he owns me. As an artiste, you will not get to wherever you want with a man who is so domineering and possessive. I like a God-fearing man and a man who is understanding.\n\nDo you prefer a black or white man as a spouse?\n\nBlack is very sweet. White is sweet too. I\u2019m about the heart. If my heart connects with you, I can be younger or older; it doesn\u2019t matter to me. As far as you have a good heart, you care for me and I care for you too. Love has no colour, no age. Only you know what you feel. Others can say whatever they want.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Prophet Wale Olagunju of Divine Seed of God Chapel Ministries, Ojoo, Ibadan, who made this known said despite the confusion over the seeming rivalry between the two Yoruba leaders, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, Afenifere leader and Prof Banji Akintoye, leader of Ilana Omo Oodua, the dream for an independent Yoruba nation, remains the ultimate target of both groups.\n\nThe popular seer insisted in this interview that the Igbo, like the Yoruba, are also determined to leave Nigeria, maintaining that nothing will hinder their desire for an independent Biafra nation.\n\nHe also spoke on other major national issues.\n\nYou have been speaking about the break up of the Nigerian nation since 2002. Considering the agitations by the Yoruba and the Igbo, would you say this has a link to your prophecy?\n\nThe break up is real. You know God is not a man that He should lie. God has been revealing this to me since 2002 as you may have read it severally. I stand by that prophecy. One million Buharis cannot stop it. The misery of this break up was what the Lord revealed to me many years back that the man that God will use to achieve this purpose will emerge in 2015. So, definitely it is this Buhari. The Yoruba are determined to leave Nigeria and nobody can stop them, they are going. Another important thing behind the break up is the APC government. Why are they marginalising the Igbo? What is their offence? Why are they killing them on daily basis? To me their offence is simply because they want Biafra nation. You don\u2019t trust them. The northern elements do not trust the Igbo, they don\u2019t trust Yoruba, you don\u2019t want them to rule Nigeria and yet you are saying they should not go. Do you marry someone by force? To me only an irresponsible person will say the Igbo and the Yoruba should not go. Every generation has their own battle to fight before getting freedom just like the biblical Israelites. So, this generation must fight their own battle. Now is the time for the Yoruba to rise up.\n\nProf Banji Akintoye and Pa Ayo Adebanjo who are believed to be the leaders of the Yoruba are not on the same page as far as the agenda for an independent Yoruba nation is concerned. Don\u2019t you think this will create confusion which will may make the realization of the Yoruba agenda a tall dream?\n\nThere is nothing like rivalry between Pa Adebanjo and Emeritus Professor Akintoye. First and foremost, Pa Adebanjo is the leader of Afenifere while Emeritus Professor Akintoye is the leader of Ilana Omo Oodua. So, everything is in order. There cannot be any confusion, each of them is pursuing his own agenda and ultimately they will arrive at same junction.\n\nOn Senator Bola Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition come 2023, don\u2019t you see this in contrast wth the Yoruba agitation?\n\nYes, you are right. It shows that Tinubu is working against the interest of the Yoruba race. He is pursuing his own personal agenda at the expense of the entire Yoruba race and he will fail woefully. The picture of Tinubu in the heart of every Yoruba now is that of a traitor, the Yoruba will never support him and neither will the Igbo. If Tinubu is truly a Yoruba leader which he claimed to be, he should always be found allying with the Yoruba agenda. For someone who claimed to be fighting the course of his kinsmen and stylishly pursuing a different mission is not good. I make bold to say it, Tinubu is a traitor. Tinubu should learn from history, nobody has ever betrayed the cause of Yoruba and succeeded in life. Tinubu should readily see himself as failure which he is. We should not limit ourselves to Tinubu alone, we need to think about other people who claimed to be leading the Yoruba and are found in conspiracy with Tinubu, the majority of Yoruba people are seeing them as traitors and truly they are.\n\nThe death of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua was recently announced; how did you receive the news?\n\nIt was a sad news, though the Lord had revealed it to me long time ago which I predicted. That does not mean I should be rejoicing over his death. I have read a lot of uncomplimentary remarks about his death, that does not concern me, my belief is that everyone of us shall give up the ghost one day and shall definitely give account of whatever we do in the flesh. So, those who are saying all sorts of things about Temitope Balogun Joshua after his demise are all wasting their time and saliva as they are not in position to judge him. My prayer is that God will forgive them.\n\nWe now seem to be in the era of civil protests in Nigeria. what is your take on this?\n\nWell, I am not in support of Buhari-must-Go protest, but I am in full support of that of Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye for self-determination. I am not in support of Buhari must go protest even though it is in order, because it can never achieve any meaningful result. It is my belief that people need to learn from EndSARS protest. I don\u2019t understand what the current protest is aiming at. Are they saying Buhari should go or they want to force him to resign? It is a mere waste of time, resources and energy. They cannot force Buhari to resign. Buhari will not resign, in a country where tribalism reigns supreme, the northern people will stand solidly behind him. It will result in loss of lives and It is an impossible mission. The people organizing the protests should avoid losing innocent lives to security operatives who may counter their protests. What I advise Nigerians to do is just to stay indoors and pray fervently unto God just like the Israelites who cried to the Almighty God who heard their prayers. Nigeria is now in soup and, in fact, the hottest part of soup in the hand of General Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nYou know Nigeria is now in the hands of myopic leaders who are only out to loot. You discover now that they move from APC to PDP or from PDP to APC, to wherever they feel they will be able to make enough loot. This is rampant among the Southerners. Call me anything, I am not bothered, I fell in love with General Babangida\u2019s two party system with Option A4 and I believe it is the best for Nigeria. With that system, you don\u2019t have the opportunity to decamp and rejoin another party. Today, when I look at the situation in our country, I feel so bad. Look at what these politicians have done in the last 20 years, they have bastardized everything. I now begin to think if this is the same Buhari of 1983 now hobnobbing with looters of our treasuries. So, how do you want me to be praying for Nigeria under this situation. What I am doing now is what God has instructed me to do, to set up a Directorate of Divine Intercessory for the Yoruba nation, of which I am the director. You\u2019ll discover that Yoruba people need prayer in the face of this calamity, if we want to avoid it, we must pray. What is happening in the country today is a very terrible situation which requires urgent prayers failing which the entity called Nigeria may not survive.\n\nPresident Buhari and Nigeria are currently in the news for Twitter ban. What is your own view on Twitter ban by Nigeria?\n\nNigerians using twitter have never committed any offence to warrant the ban placed on them by their president. The Twitter management or whatever name you call them has the right to remove whatever they feel is not right for the world to see, after all they removed a post by the former United States President, Donald Trump and he did not as a result of that place any ban on US citizens from using Twitter. The ban Is wrong and uncalled for. For President Buhari to be threatening any Nigerian who uses Twitter with legal action is totally uncalled for, grossly immature and must be condemned by all.\n\nWhat do you make of the call by the self-acclaimed freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo popular called Sunday Igboho who has again called on the Fulani herdsmen to live the Southwest?\n\nThe fact of the case is that Alhaji Abdulai Yerima, the Arewa Consultative Youth President started this by calling on the Igbo to leave the North and nobody queried him for it. To me, Sunday Igboho is a Yoruba militant leader who never carried a gun. He saw that his people are being massacred on daily basis without the government doing anything about it. So, how does that become an offence? The Federal Government does not see anything bad in the herdsmen who are using three weapons: Juju, AK 47 as well as their trust in the Federal Government\u2019s backing; to fight other ethnic groups, but they are busy pursuing Sunday Igboho for fighting the course of his people. The action of the Federal Government is only helping in propagating the course of Sunday Igboho and the entire Yoruba race. The Yoruba people now see him as their saviour. What I think Sunday Igboho needs to do is to watch his tongue and should stop insulting Yoruba elders.\n\nWhat is your advice for the people and government of Nigeria?\n\nFirst and foremost, I am confused as to what advice I can give President Buhari who happens to be a chronic unrepentant tribalist. But not withstanding I will advise him to dissolve his present cabinet which consists of people with no idea on how to move Nigeria forward. He needs to inject fresh blood into his government. Let him scout for people with fresh and brilliant ideas, that can help to move the country forward. My advice to the Yoruba and Igbo is to seek the face of God in holiness and pray fervently unto God of Abraham who saved the Israelites from the hand of Pharaoh and the task masters to put an end to the marginalization and killing of Yoruba and Igbo and to take them to the Promised Land because the killing is getting out of proportion.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Asaba Accord: Southern governors are broken records \u2013Senator",
          "text": "By Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nSenator Abdullahi Adamu is representing Nasarawa West Senatorial District in the upper legislative chamber of the National Assembly.\n\nIn this interview, he indicted state governors for not doing enough to police their domains. He also lampooned them for frustrating restructuring. He spoke on other national issues: What do you make out of this current situation in the country?\n\nIt is the first time since I have come of age that somebody will just get up and say anything about the government and go scot free. A lot of people today sabotage this government by the day. Even people who are under oath are sabotaging this government today. So, what do you expect? Those who are willing and lurking by the corner to do bad have now got the leverage. They have now got people who are even in government who are not showing satisfaction, loyalty, patriotism. How do you expect somebody who has such tendencies to go along, just waiting for an opportunity? These are some of the issues that together have placed us where we are today. And nobody can single-handedly, no matter what power you give him, can get us out of this mess. It has to be all of us Nigerians to get us back on track. This is not to say that Buhari\u2019s government is blameless. I am not suggesting that at all. What I am saying is that we are contributing more to creating problem for the government than what we are doing to solving the problem of the government. This government is our government. It was elected. No matter what we say. The National Assembly has PDP, APGA there and the YPP, APC are there, so everybody is there. There are people from every part of this country in the National Assembly and also in the executive. Take a look at the federal cabinet. Every state in this country has a minister. Some even have two. The idea is that, they are supposed to bring value and add to Buhari\u2019s capacity. Where are they? What are they saying today? Is there anything in this country that says a minister cannot talk? If a governor can talk, a minister cannot talk? What are we are doing? Everybody just fold his hands and Buhari unfortunately for us, is not the talking type. If he were to open up, you will wish you are down the drain. But God has given him the capacity to absorb. It is part of the characteristics of a leader. Yes, there are certain things that have happened. Yes, also he was supposed to react and respond to, but we have people who are not patient. You saw a problem today and you want a solution today. I don\u2019t want to sound like I am justifying what you may see as failure, but I am giving my own thoughts as to why I think we are where we are and why I think most Nigerians who have the responsibility are not living up to their billing. If I am in government, you expect something from me. I am also part of government. I cannot exonerate myself. Most of us that say we are educated, even if you went to a missionary school, there was a contribution of this government in educating you. So, there is a contribution the public have made in preparing you to be where you are today and as a patriotic citizen, one would expect some level of concern, and the concern would not be genuine if you become a critic. Even a critic can be positively critical, but where it is just a matter of picking whatever you want to pick and then throw it out without caring about the implication, it is not good. It is just bad.\n\nRecently, there have been different groups with agitations here and there. The Southern Governors met in Asaba. They called it the Asaba Accord. In that accord, they called for many things, including the ban on open grazing, call for structuring. Why do you think these agitations are popping up now?\n\nThey are sounding like a broken record. You know what a broken record does? It cracks. I expected them to be more educated people with responsibility of governance. Each of those governors is under an oath for loyalty, for preservation of the sovereignty of this country. That means everyone of them is duty bound to stay away from any act or words that have the tendency of being perceived as being separatists. I was a governor for eight years. I know what the Governors\u2019 Forum is. I headed it for five years of my right years. Before that, I was chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum. So, the secretariat you see and the bureaucracy I set them up during my time. Those that took over from us we began to have a situation. This is because we are in a democracy and people will come from a zone and bring a shopping list to the president. There are people in the cabinet and the National Economic Council, National Council of States. They will get themselves out and come and talk for their states or their zone only. They hold meetings almost every year or twice. They have a meeting of all stakeholders, ranging from private citizens, captains of industry, who have made a mark, who are respected in some parts of the country. They hold meetings publicly and come out with a communique. Among them, are people who have served this government and they will make pronouncement against what the government is doing. Before the Asaba Accord, there was a meeting of all the state governors. About 36 of them were there. Less than a week of that meeting, some people came out and claimed Southern Governors Forum. There is nothing wrong with regional bodies. But these governors know the constitution and they know that every Nigerian has the right of movement and association. A right to pursue legitimate goals. These governors are saying no cattle or open grazing. What is the alternative? Have they provided any? If Northern governors come together and take a position, what will happen? What right have you to tell Nigerians not to move freely? If northern groups say no southern business in the area, how will that end up? There are killings of northerners going on in the South. If the North decides to retaliate, we will call it geniocde. What is happening to us? We only know about problems, but not solutions. People are openly calling for a break up of the country.\n\nPeople have attributed some of the agitations in the country to the leadership style of President Muhammadu Buhari. Do you agree?It is too wide a statement. When you\u2019re talking of somebody\u2019s leadership qualities, you don\u2019t just pass a judgment. We have the misfortune of combining situation with Boko Haram and other insecurity challenges. It is unfortunate. We must get one fact very clear. This thing didn\u2019t start with Buhari. Yes, there are a few cases and increase in insecurity. I cannot deny that. That will be unfair. But the major problem is the failure of state administrations to take up the issue of security seriously. Just like Buhari, every governor has taken an oath to protect the lives and property of the citizens. They get money from the Federation Account and also generate revenues from their states. These are the facts. We agree that the central government needs to handle the issue, but states have to play complementary roles in tackling the issues too. Go and take an inventory of the number of states paying salaries today. This is not just about Buhari. States are not paying salaries even with the Paris Club refunds and others they\u2019ve gotten. If you\u2019ve small problems from the various states, overtime, they aggregate and they become big problems. Suddenly, they refer to the problems as Buhari\u2019s problems. Every state governor has a responsibility to provide for their people. Nobody said Buhari was an angel. Nobody also said because Buhari is now president, every state governor should abandon his responsibility.\n\nWhy are these agitations on the rise?\n\nSome of these agitations are induced. Few years ago, were they talking about break up of the country? Why now? Political leaders are in support of what their people are doing. They cannot speak up and challenge them. They just lament. They want the president to handle it. They are talking about restructuring. What is new there? When you and I know that we passed a law in the National Assembly. We tried to free state assemblies, judiciary too. Is Buhari responsible for that? Local governments were created by law. We have tried to free them. Governors are opposed to it. Is Buhari responsible too? How long have we had this aberration? They operate a joint account with local governments. But do these funds go to them directly? I was a governor. Local givenments used to get their funds directly. We created some development areas. We followed the law. Not a dime was taken. Now, local governments can\u2019t execute projects. They don\u2019t see any money. Local governments don\u2019t even get their money. These issues are affecting our democracy. We want to give Buhari a bad name.\n\nEfforts were made by the National Assembly to free up the Local government and assemblies. Even the state judiciary as part of moves to restrcutire\u2026\n\nThat was part of restructuring. What is even this restructuring? Those saying they want us to take a look at the Exclusive Legislative List. We don\u2019t have to fight over restructuring. We have two chambers that can handle that. They were elected. This is our job. If you\u2019re dissatisfied with the issues in Nigeria, you can bring these issues to the National Assembly. They don\u2019t want that. They want to blame the president. There is nowhere the president can alter the constitution. He can\u201dt even give an order for that to be done. And these agitators are educated people. Take the issues to us and Buhari will assent to it. We keep saying that Nigerians didn\u2019t write the constitution. Was it Buhari that wrote it? Why is everybody calling Buhari? It\u2019s sickening. There is a limit. Not that we can\u2019t talk. We have the capacity to do more. But what we won\u2019t take likely is for any part of this country to think that they have a louder voice. That is not true. When the North starts talking, maybe there will be sense. If we want this country to stay on, we will. I speak as a Nigerian of northern extraction. I will defend that as long as I live. Those who want to leave can go. We will continue to exist as one Nigeria. Let\u2019s see where they will go. Seperatists are taking laws into their hands and we are tolerating them. They shout about human rights. We need to stop. It won\u2019t do us any good. No country has survived two civil wars. Army generals have told me that. We must watch out and guide against another war. We should be careful about what we say. These agitators can go. But we will remain.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Buhari: Drug Trafficking, Abuse Pose More Threat than Insurgency, Banditry",
          "text": "\u2022Says drug abuse already stretches across three generations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, identified drug trafficking and abuse as more threatening to the stability of the nation than banditry and insurgency that are prevalent in some parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe president, declared that drug abuse has become so endemic in the country now that it already stretches across three generations of grandparents, parents and their wards.\n\nThis is just as the the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has disclosed that within the last five months, no fewer than 2,180 suspected traffickers including five drug barons had been nabbed across the country.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustaph, spoke at the launch of the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), an initiative of the NDLEA to mark the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed: \u201cShare Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.\u201d\n\nThe President emphasised that the anti-drug war was more deadly than the insurgency in the Northeastern part of the country or the acts of banditry in the Northwest or the acts of kidnapping that transcends all the geopolitical zones of this country.\n\nAccording to him, it is a war that is destroying three generations, because there were clips of some grandparents on drugs, parents on drugs, and by extension, their wards and children had also taken to drugs.\n\n\u201cSo, this is a war that is targeting three generations in a stretch. So, it is more deadly than even the security challenges that we are having in this country and I believe strongly that every effort must be put in place to ensure that we deal with the issues of substance abuse and trafficking and manufacture so that we can get to the root cause of the mirage of insecurity problems that are confronting this nation and I believe strongly, with every bit of conviction, that if we are able to deal with the issues of drug abuse, substantially, our security challenges will drastically reduce as we walk towards a drug free, Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe President also charged the NDLEA to intensify efforts at ridding the vast forests of the Southwest and South-South regions of the country of criminal elements, who had made the places their hideouts, from where they launch criminal onslaughts as well as for farming marijuana.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cI am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities, but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories, break the supply chain, discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers, rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests, especially, in the Southwest and the South-South.\n\n\u201cYou may, therefore, need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts, because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people\u201d.\n\nHe, however, called on all families, schools, civil society organisations, professional associations, religious organisations, the academia, community leaders and individuals to work for the common good in order to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking.\n\n\u201cAs your President, I will continue to address underlying causes of drug abuse, including poverty reduction, for which my pledge for lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years and strengthened by the recently developed National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy signposts my unwavering commitment.\n\n\u201cI would like to appreciate our stakeholders and international collaborators, especially, the European Union, and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Control, for their unwavering support to our drug control efforts, including the development of our roadmap. Also appreciated are the members of the inter-ministerial committee on drug control, civil society organisations, the academia, for their contributions and efforts to our National Drug Control initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe war against drugs is a war that must be fought by all, it is therefore my pleasure, to declare on behalf of the good people of Nigeria, a War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), not just as a slogan, but a call for civil action for all Nigerians to take active part in this war\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on their current efforts, Chairman of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) put the cash value and drugs seized in the past five months since he assumed office at over N90 billion adding that over 2,180 traffickers had been arrested, including five drug barons controlling different cartels across Nigeria.\n\nHe also revealed that a record 2.05 million kilograms of drugs were intercepted and seized across the country; and 2,100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 already jailed by courts.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile the statistics are impressive, we wouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Augean Stable in five months. We have only made a head start. We need to sustain the momentum. We need to win the drug war. We cannot afford to be complacent.\u201d\n\nMarwa said going by the available statistics, Nigeria ranked the highest users of cannabis worldwide, adding that revelations from kidnapped victims have collaborated the facts that illicit substances were enablers of insecurity currently plaguing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria\u2019s albatross. The enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.\n\n\u201cToday, it is a glaring fact that Nigerian youths are involved in drug abuse. Over the years, an undesirable subculture had flourished whereby adolescents and young adults wantonly indulged in the abuse of illicit substances. They not only became addicted to conventional substances such as cannabis and prescription opioids, such as tramadol and codeine, they also experimented with dangerous mixtures leading to novel psychotropic substances such as \u2018monkey tail\u2019 and \u2018skoochies\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the context of that warped reality, they also normalised the smoking of cannabis as we have seen in some popular music videos and on social media. \u2018High\u2019 became part of their social media. So, it wasn\u2019t surprising, when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019, for example, indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians, some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age.\n\n\u201cThe Global Drug Survey 2019, also, cited cannabis as the most abused substance with West Africa having the highest abuse prevalence. The World Health Organisation on substance abuse also stated unequivocally that cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in Africa, with the highest prevalence, between 5.2% and 13.5%, found in West Africa. Ladies and Gentlemen, West Africa, by implication, means Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe NDLEA boss linked the successes recorded by the agency so far to the resolution of officers and men of the NDLEA to clean up Nigeria and make the country drug free.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in this campaign, we are tackling the scourge of drug abuse and trafficking on all fronts. In addition to the arrest and prosecution of drug offenders, we have worked out intensive drug abuse awareness and sensitisation programmes targeting different groups, with an emphasis on youths. In this regard, my administration has thrown the door open to all for partnership in the fight against abuse of illicit substances. It is to this end that we have set up a Special Purpose Committee to involve stakeholders in the cause.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, called on the President to approve the appointment of 10,000 additional workers for NDLEA, which he said was currently \u201cunderstaffed\u201d, \u201cunderfunded\u201d, and \u201cill-equipped\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was represented by Chairman, House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Hon Francis Agwu, said the NDLEA was using weapons used during the civil war, stressing the need to fight the menace of drugs abuse in the country as all crimes were enabled by narcotics drugs addiction.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly was working to amend the Police Trust Fund Act to ensure that other policing agencies like NDLEA benefitted from the pool, adding that efforts would be made to guarantee accelerated endorsement of the president after its amendment.\n\n\u201cIf the surge in crimes must be minimised, then, we must fight narcotics drugs addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the United Nations General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and hinder a healthy recovery.\n\nRepresented by Oliver Stolpe, the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the UN Scribe urged law enforcement agents to go after the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.\n\nGuterres said, the 2021 world drug report of UN, showed that death and crime attributed to disorders have nearly doubled over the past decade, adding that while new HIV/AIDS infections among adults have declined worldwide but not among people, who injected drugs, which accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.\n\nHe, however, claimed that international cooperation had helped to limit the proliferation of new psycho active substances but the problem was shifting to poorer regions, where control systems were weaker, drug sales continued to rise and non-medical use of pharmaceutical such as Tramadol and Codeine was expanding.\n\nHe too agreed that drug trafficking and organised crime fuel and perpetuate circles of violence and conflicts, adding that armed groups and terrorists profited from the illicit drugs trade, even as the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit drug cultivation.\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Commander of the NDLEA, Mr. Haruna Kwatiche, has said bandits, kidnappers and terrorists operated after consuming hard drugs, which usually gave them fake confidence and strength.\n\nKwatiche, who disclosed this in Minna, Saturday, said these categories of people often claimed they did not know how and why they embarked on such acts after being arrested and when the effect of the drugs had worn out.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark this years United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking, Kwatiche said the country should rise up to stop the circulation of hard drugs by bringing all peddlers under the law if the activities of bandits kidnapers and terrorists were to be reduced to the barest minimum in the country.\n\nHe admitted that 90 per cent of other crimes and criminalities were committed under the influence of drugs and warned that, \u201cUntil all stakeholders join hands together to fight this menace, crimes and criminalities will continue to increase\n\n\u201cThe NDLEA is committed to confronting circulation and consumption of hard drugs frontally\u201d the Niger commander declared, adding that to achieve this the Agency required the support of all the major stakeholders in the states of the federation.\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, commended the NDLEA for its renewed war against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in the state and assured the agency of government\u2019s support in order to reduce the menace of drug abuse in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn monetary terms, changes in marginal fields\u2019 ownership in the oil and gas industry were worth about $584 million in 2019, the latest report on the sector by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has indicated. The report showed that the changes were mainly due to internal reorganisation by asset owners, inability to pay outstanding debts owed to government, and non-development of oil assets, leading to revocation of licences.\n\nIn all, eight of the deals yielded the $584 million, the sum generated by three of the changes were not available in the report, while four changes were due to revocation of operating licences of the original owners by the federal government.\n\nThe licences cancelled were those belonging to Allied Energy Resources, Cavendish Petroleum, Express Petroleum and Gas, Pan Ocean Corporation Asset, and Summit Oil International Limited, which operated OML 120, 110, 108, 98, and OPL 206, respectively.\n\nWhile 7 Energy transferred 62.5 per cent shares of 51 per cent equity in Stub Creek Universal Energy Resources in a transaction worth $3.682 million, it also moved 100 per cent ownership of its shares in Uquo marginal field to Savannah Petroleum Plc in a $10.586 million deal.\n\nIn the same vein, FHN transferred its 100 per cent interest to Cape Energy Limited, Vertex Energy, and Earl Act Global in a $1.99 million deal while PanOcean allocated OML 98 to the NNPC JV worth $99.836 million in a deal that was expected to be fully paid for by January 2021.\n\nForty per cent equity of Ubima field, according to the document, was assigned to Wester Ord Oil and Gas Limited for $700,000, while there was a reassignment of 38.67 per cent interest from OML 141 to Emerald Energy, Amni, and Blue Water Group.\n\nEroton E&P also assigned 16.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of Sahara field and Bolton in a deal worth $6.901 million.\n\nBesides, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) acquired OML 11, formerly operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), in a contract totalling $456.03 million. Full payment is due in Q4 2021.\n\nSimilarly, New Age Exploration Nigeria Limited acquired OML 113, while Vitol transferred 12.83 participating interest in the field in a $4 million sale.\n\nDuring the year under review, seismic data acquisition was up by 348 per cent, field development plans 65 per cent, well activities 45 per cent, while gas development plan was down by 75 per cent, with six approved for 2019, as opposed to 24 in 2018.\n\nIn terms of deferred production due to shutdowns, scheduled repairs and maintenance, pipeline breaks/leaks, and general force majeure, SPDC was the biggest casualty, with deferred production of 30.9 million barrels, comprising 56.10 per cent of the entire quantity during the year.\n\nSeplat was next with 7 million barrels, followed by SNEPCo, with 3.8 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, NPDC and Neconde suffered losses and subsequent deferment of 3.7 million barrels, Newcross\u2019 was 3.2 million barrels, Aiteo deferred 2.84 million barrels, Energia\u2019s share of deferment was 1.7 million barrels, while APDNL\u2019s loss was 733,000 barrels during the year.\n\nAll deferred production amounted to 55.2 million barrels while there were 1,387 pipeline breaks, with Mosimi recording the highest with 637 breaks, followed by Port Harcourt, 536, and Warri with 96 breaks.\n\nAccording to the report, in 2019, 43 companies emerged buyers of Nigeria\u2019s federation export crude oil, compared to 41 in 2018, with 20 of the entities accounting for 73 per cent of total sales while the rest 23 accounted for 27 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, companies operating in the Nigeria oil and gas space expended $896 million on social expenditure, including a mandatory sum of $815.59 that is paid to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), while the non-mandatory expenditure stood at $81.2 million. Of that amount, NDDC got $721.275 million from its three per cent statutory allocation, while NCDMB received $94.3 million.\n\nOf the 34 companies, three entities, including Agip, Total Upstream, and Sterling Global Resources, topped the list of the non-mandatory social expenditure companies, with $12 million, $11 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\n\nNon-mandatory social expenditure is voluntary payment for or to the host communities and other commitments across the country. They include provision of social amenities, like roads, boreholes, health centres, etc.\n\nNEITI further observed that the requirement for all companies, including government-owned enterprises, in Nigeria to submit Audited Financial Statement (AFS) to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and Auditor General of the Federation in six months after the preceding year was not strictly adhered to by all covered entities.\n\n\u201cThis has the potential of creating an assurance uniformity gap for the data used in the exercise,\u201d NEITI stated.\n\nHowever, the Dr Ogbonnaya Orji-led agency said despite that limitation, the additional steps taken by the independent administrator using other elements of the accounts covered the gap caused by the development.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has responded to a fresh threat by a militant group, Niger Delta Avengers, to cause instability in Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta region.\n\nThe group in a recent statement attributed to it said it was planning to sabotage Nigeria\u2019s economy by attacking oil installations in the region.\n\nThe group also threatened to attack politicians \u201ccollaborating\u201d with the Nigerian government to \u201cundermine\u201d the interest of the region.\n\nBut Mr Buhari on Sunday described the group\u2019s statement as \u201ccurious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC),\u201d a presidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina said in a statement.\n\nThe statement contained Mr Buhari\u2019s remarks during his meeting on Friday with the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) who visited him at the Presidential Villa. The remarks could be seen also as the president\u2019s response to the latest threat by the Niger Delta Avengers, apparently.\n\nMr Buhari, who expressed concern about the environmental pollution in the Niger Delta, said he had directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the ongoing cleanup of Ogoniland is \u201cimplemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities\u201d.\n\nHe said relevant government agencies were working to reduce oil spills in the region.\n\nPresident Buhari also talked about a request for the creation of additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people, as well as the call for the restructuring of the Nigerian federation.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe said he agreed with the call for the allocation of operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people, but that it would have to follow laid down rules and regulations. \u201cI see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Buhari also said the completion of the East-West Road, which is meant to link together the states in the Niger Delta region, was top on his administration\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe presidential spokesperson, Mr Adesina, said Mr Buhari\u2019s comment \u201crenders any sabre-rattling rather unnecessary.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",
          "summary": "Tunde Opalana, AbujaThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\nThis has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals.",

          "title": "Insecurity in FCT: UniAbuja, Veritas varsity, COED Zuba, 5 others on red alert",
          "text": "Tertiary institutions within and around the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja are on red alert following escalating incidences of kidnapping in higher institutions across the country in recent times.\n\nWithin the last two months, some tertiary institutions in Kaduna, Niger, Benue, Kebbi and Abia states were attacked and students taken captives for ransom, thereby heightening tension about the safety of students in higher institutions across the country.\n\nThe FCT Police Command had in May, directed the nine public and privately owned universities, polytechnic and college of education located in and around the territory to reduce their academic activities to a \u2018minimal level\u2019 to forestall inadvertently and unduly exposing their students and staff to present danger of kidnapping by insurgents and bandits.\n\nThe directive followed unusual movements of persons suspected to have banditry profiling into the FCT as well as claims that insurgents were occupying Shiroro town and villages around its vicinity in Niger state.\n\nThe alleged occupied places are about two hours drive to Abuja metropolis and the respective area councils, as recently stated by Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nTertiary institutions in Abuja\n\nThe FCT plays host to eight public and privately owned higher institutions, including six universities, a polytechnic and college of education namely: University of Abuja, Nile University, Baze University, Veritas University, Dubem Polytechnic, College of Education Zuba, Philomath University Kuje, African University of Science and Technology Abuja (yet to take off) and Bingham University in Karu, Nasarawa state with very close proximity to the FCT.\n\nTertiary institutions meet security agencies\n\nAccordingly, the police authorities held series of meetings with respective higher institutions\u2019 management highlighting the present danger as well as taking precautionary measures aimed at averting such danger in future.\n\nBeyond holding meetings at the level of the FCT Police Command, the tertiary institutions\u2019 managements equally held security meetings with their respective Divisional Police Officers in the six area councils where further precautionary measures were suggested and modalities for implementation put in place.\n\nIn one of such meetings between the Zuba DPO and the College of Education, Zuba held Thursday, June 17th, 2021, the school management was directed to increase the presence of plainclothes security operatives in and around their facilities and to ensure both students and visitors were properly profiled but without attracting attention.\n\nSpeaking on the development, a senior management staff of the college, who, for administrative purpose, spoke under anonymity said: \u201cYes, we were directed by the police authorities in the FCT Command to step up security presence in our facilities because of the escalating incidences of kidnapping in tertiary institutions in the country.\n\n\u201cIn fact, just yesterday (Thursday, June 17th, 2021) we were in a meeting with the DPO of Zuba where we discussed issues of security of the school and its environs and it was resolved that security be stepped up to reflect the current situation.\n\n\u201cEven before the directive, our security arrangement has always been intact. We have the presence of operatives of the Directorate of State Security Service in and around the school. They are there to monitor and assist us coordinate security activities within the school because of our huge students\u2019 population and staff. We are always conscious of security, especially following the escalating cases of kidnapping for ransom of tertiary institutions\u2019 students in the country in recent time,\n\n\u201cBefore now, we had taken solid measures to tighten security around our facilities and the students\u2019 population and we are not about to slack. Instead, in response to the current threat, we are ever more determined to further strengthen our presence and boost security consciousness among students and staff.\u201d\n\nUniAbuja\n\nSimilarly, the University of Abuja Head of Information Department, Dr Habib Yakoob, said the school, in conjunction with the police authorities, has adopted measures to further tighten security within and around the permanent site of the university located along the Airport Road.\n\n\u201cAs you can see in the school, students are going about their normal businesses without tension, there is calm because there is reasonable security. We are on our toes, very alert and monitoring situation.\n\n\u201cThis university is a federal government entity so we are not in charge of the police nor any official security agencies but what we have done is to have our internal security mechanism that we hope can contain any security issues.\n\n\u201cOur security personnel have the capacity to carry out surveillance to ensure the safety of our students. Besides, they are working in conjunction with the federal government security agencies, particularly the police, in case we have a threat,\u201d Yakoob said.\n\nVeritas University\n\nAt Veritas University, a privately owned institution, the institution scaled down academic activities, including vacating the students on campus.\n\nThis was stated by the institution\u2019s Vice Chancellor, Professor Hyacinth Ichuko.\n\n\u201cWe are a residential university and over time, we have been very conscious of the security of our staff and students. We have had to build a police station in front of the university at the buffer zone of the university and they (police) are gracious enough to send 14 police officers there. Still that does not stop our internal security efforts. We have beefed up our own internal security in terms of use of no-armed bearing security operatives,\u201d Ichuko said while featuring on a recent television programme.\n\nNotwithstanding the various security arrangements put in place by the various authorities, Professor Ichuko called for increased military presence in schools as well as collaborative efforts among the higher institutions and parents as well as the security agencies.\n\nThis, he said, would not only ensure the institutions are protected but would also wade off the threat of kidnapping and banditry-related vices and make it almost impossible in the FCT higher institutions.\n\nPerimeter fence\n\nThough each of these schools occupies large expanse of land, very few of them have protective perimeter fence which could stall encroachment by unwanted elements.\n\nFor instance, University of Abuja has almost 12,000 hectares of land at its permanent site along Airport Road, but less than 5,000 hectares enjoy perimeter fence with almost the long stretch of land comprising of hills and rocks and thick bushes behind its perimeter yet to be fenced.\n\nSpeaking on this, spokesman of the university, Dr. Yakoob said: \u201cWell our perimeter fence, in all modesty, covers a relatively large portion of the university and work is still ongoing. But the university is not only relying on the perimeter fence. We have reasonably adequate security and we are working in conjunction with other security forces and we also have a mechanism if there is any threat to our security.\u201d\n\nAlso, Veritas University said it\u2019s doing its best to provide a secure environment for both students and staff, stressing that the security buffer zone created was for that purpose.\n\n\u201cWe also want to create a security buffer around the university and we have gone out of our way to support the vigilante groups around the communities,\u201d Ichuko explained.\n\nBut the situation at the College of Education, Zuba is almost similar to the UniAbuja as the school\u2019s permanent site is entirely without front and back perimeter fence.\n\n\u201cWe have perimeter fence around the temporary site and also around the permanent site,\u201d a senior staff insisted.\n\nHowever, our correspondent observed that though it (COE Zuba) occupies several acres of land, but apart from the unused main entrance, perimeter fence is nonexistent leaving the school completely exposed.\n\nThe sprawling permanent site consisting of about three acres of land is a beehive of construction activities with herders and farmers competing for portions of the land.\n\nThe same is applicable to Baze University where a makeshift security presence is at the entrance with a reflexive mirror used to check the under of cars while pedestrians could walk almost with minimum hassles. From behind it shares a boundary with the thick bush adjacent to the CCECC, International Cancer Centre along the Lugbe Expressway but with a near nonexistent perimeter fence.\n\nStudents raise concern\n\nStudents of Veritas varsity, Baze varsity, UniAbuja and others all lamented the lack of protection which perimeter fence could have offered them and pleaded with the federal government to prevail on their respective school managements to construct perimeter fence to provide a measure of safeguard against intruders into their schools.\n\nA final year student at Veritas University Bwari, \u2018May\u2019 Danjuma, said since they were asked to vacate their hostels sometime April, most students had been anxious to complete their programmes.\n\n\u201cWe have been eager to get over with our programmes because the tension is palpable. In fact, none would want to experience the ordeal the kidnapped students of Greenfield University got in the hands of kidnappers. I can\u2019t imagine being subjected to any ordeal in the hands of kidnappers or insurgents. Most students would gladly welcome the presence of the military in our school pending when the situation normalizes,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, a student of the Faculty of Arts (English Language) University of Abuja, who simply identified himself as Theo, lamented the insecurity around the school.\n\nTheo said: \u201cThe tension generated by insecurity around schools is worsened by lack of adequate presence of security operatives. Besides, we, in the Faculty of Arts, are not safe at all because the school is seriously exposed without the perimeter fence at the stretch of land that constitutes the back of the school. You can see rocky hills, columns of thick bushes all around, herders stray in at will and you don\u2019t know who is who. The school is vulnerable without the protective perimeter fence. We need improved deployment of the police and other armed security outfits.\u201d\n\nAnother student, Ismail Musa, said: \u201cThe federal government needs to step up security presence in schools in the FCT particularly tertiary institutions which seem to be the focus of attacks by unknown gunmen or kidnappers. Whatever internal arrangements the schools have made is not enough to guarantee reasonable security.\u201d\n\nExpressing similar worry, Bobby Frank,a student of College of Education Zuba said: \u201cInsecurity has become the sad reality of our society and it has induced tension, particularly in schools which are gradually becoming the epicentre for kidnappers. Well, while we count on God, we hope the government will beef up security around school facilities not only in the COE, Zuba but everywhere as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurgents and kidnappers I think are working together firstly to create tension and then scare away students from school. If the government does not want education in the country destroyed, now is the time to act decisively against these unwanted elements in the society. Besides, tightening security in schools, it is high time the government arrested, prosecuted and jailed kidnappers and insurgents to tame the tide of invasion of schools and kidnapping of Nigeria\u2019s future leaders,\u201d said another student, Muradi Bulama.\n\nAt the Philomath University, Kuje which is set to resume academic activities September, communities around the institution urged the authority to tighten security around the facility because of its vulnerability to attacks from \u201cdebased elements.\u201d\n\nExpert says there\u2019s reason to worry\n\nCommenting on the development, a security expert, retired Captain Aliyu Umar Babangida and CEO Coldwater and Riversand Consult, in a recent television programme, shared the concern of the students.\n\nThe ex-military intelligence officer said: \u201cIn virtually all the regions, we have a very heightened state of fear due to insecurity. It is not surprising that people who have seen nomads moving cows from one place to another have become worried.\n\n\u201cThe tension is further heightened because a certain group of people and their activities have become synonymous to insecurity because the situation itself was not managed properly a initio. Certain men did not manage these kidnappers and herdsmen\u2019s security issues properly and today one has become synonymous to the other.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has called on the States\u2019 House of Assembly to ensure that the Constitutional Amendment Bill is passed when passed to them by the National Assembly.\n\nOkowa made the call on Friday when he received the Conference of Speakers of States\u2019 Legislatures in Nigeria led by its Chairman and Speaker of Bauchi State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Abubakar Suleiman, at Government House, Asaba.\n\nHe stated that as states\u2019 legislatures, the onus was on them to pass the Constitutional amendments in the interest of the nation.\n\nHe said that the nation was in dire need of the amendments to provide equity, justice and fairness in the affairs of the country.\n\nOkowa urged the Conference to continue to be a voice for the people and to remain true in enforcing executive-legislative relations across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that the National Assembly is currently engaged in the review of the 1999 Constitution and when they are through, it will be passed over to the States\u2019 Assemblies for passage.\n\n\u201cThe management of the country has placed a key role in your hands and I urge you all to look at it passionately to ensure that we are fair, equitable and justiciable in all decisions we will take in passing the ammendment.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in trouble but I believe that in working together, we can pilot the nation out of the current challenges through a passionate approach because as leaders, everything about governance must be in the overall interest of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the legislature in Delta for its cooperation which had led to the achievements recorded by his administration in the last six years.\n\nAccording to him, whatever we have achieved as a state so far is because we have a very robust relationship with the State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThey are very passionate about the development of the state and that has helped us to make lots of progress.\n\n\u201cI am glad that you have organised yourselves under the Conference to compare notes, just as the Governors, to discuss and share ideas and to also talk to ourselves because it helps to improve the bond of unity among the various states.\n\n\u201cThe more we are talking together and remain strong the better for our country and I believe that was why the Conference of Speakers was berthed and I hope that you will continue to use the conference to better the lots of this nation,\u201d he added.\n\nOkowa who underscored the importance of executive-legislative relations, said \u201cif any state is to make progress there is need for a very warm relationship with the executive and legislative arms to enable policies and programmes work more efficiently than they would have ordinarily had.\n\n\u201cWe are in very trying times and this poses more burden on the various state legislatures. There must be a lot of collaborations and thinking to get the states out of unemployment, poverty and insecurity pervading the nation.\n\n\u201cA very cordial relationship that works will help to improve on the development of our country.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, you have a lot of role to play and I charge you to see yourselves going beyond just making laws, to help the executive to ensure that the people get the best of governance.\n\n\u201cThe fear of legislative autonomy is unfounded because our state House of Assembly has been operating in autonomy since 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Rt. Hon. Suleiman had said that the Speakers were in the state for the second quarter meeting of the Conference.\n\nHe said that the Conference was made up of Speakers of the 36 States Houses of Assembly representing the 998 members of Houses of Assembly in the country.\n\nHe commended the Governor for the massive development in Asaba and parts of the state, adding that the mutual understanding between the Executive and Legislative arms of government in the state was commendable and worthy of emulation.\n\nSpeaker of Delta House of Assembly and Deputy Chairman of the Conference of Speakers, Rt Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, appreciated Governor Okowa for his love for the legislature and for graciously approving to host the Conference in Delta.",

That is why there is so much suffering in the world. Today, the Lord wants to repair all that is broken down. Only come back and reconnect to Him.\n\n\u201cYou will reconnect and your life will never remain the same. You can begin to think about the freedom, power and authority the angels enjoy, and God made it so that we can enjoy the good life He planned for us. The glory and honour are coming back. The Lord will cleanse and change you, and all you lost will be restored to you.\n\n\u201cHe also made all things: sickness, suffering, oppression, calamities, etc. to be under your feet. By divine connection, from tonight, there will be a restoration of all that God planned for you originally.\u201d\n\nThe former university don stressed that sin is the instrument used by the devil to influence people to do evil and achieve his aim of destroying human lives and all good things that would bring peace and development.\n\nHe added that sin is the spiritual challenge of man that generates physical and moral decays in the society, therefore appealed to Nigerians to connect with God, and the expected divine intervention individually, family, nationally, and socio-economically will come but through absolute repentance from all sin.\n\n\u201cYou can invite sin with one finger but at the end, ten fingers will not be enough to remove them. Many people commit sin today and they feel they are alright. We are saying tonight that when you are in sin, you are not alright.\n\n\u201cThe Lord is your Redeemer, He will save you from all troubles and problems. He knows where your goodness, prosperity, satisfaction and sufficient supplies are, and He will lead you to them as you connect to Him. After giving you all this goodness, in the end, He will take you to heaven.\n\n\u201cWhen God calls you to repentance, you have to come to Him and do away with all those things which cause disconnection, chief of which is sin\u201d, he said.",

If we do not start getting it right now, we will not get it right by the year 2050.\u201d\n\nArguing that the population could either be an asset or a liability, the elder statesman noted that if the nation does not make adequate preparations then the country will pay for its over-population both now and in the future.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is education about population management. Some people don\u2019t like saying family planning, but whatever you do, you must manage your population to the benefit of all that is living within your nation,\u201d Obasanjo stated.\n\nWhile fielding questions from the students on mentorship, the former president highlighted service to the fatherland, integrity, loyalty, and good moral standing as some of the virtues that could sustain them in their varied career paths.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the threat issued by the Niger Delta Avengers on Saturday is rather unnecessary.\n\nThe special adviser to the president on media and publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement, quoted Buhari as saying that all issues raised by the group were already responded to when the president met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the presidential villa on Thursday.\n\nMr. Adesina said when the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress visited the president, issues such as the call for restructuring and the inauguration of a board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) were addressed.\n\nHe quotes the president saying \u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the niger delta and as you are aware the hydrocarbon pollution remediation project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the minister of environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities\u201d\n\nThe militant group, in a statement on Saturday, had announced the launch of \u2018operation humble\u2019, a new mission to resume attacks in the oil-rich region.\n\nThey said the south-south remains the most underdeveloped region in the country, with their needs and interests \u201cundermined by the failed Nigerian State\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: How FG Will Tax Profits Made By Global Tech Giants In Nigeria \u2013 Osinbajo\n\nBelow is a statement from the President on Sunday signed by his media aide, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cThe media was on Sunday awash with threats and demands by the group to embark on economic sabotage through the bombing of critical oil and gas installations unless certain demands, including the development of the Niger Delta, and restructuring of the Federation, were met.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\u201d\n\n\u201cFor clarity and record purposes, below is the full text of the speech by President Buhari on Friday, June 25, 2021, which renders any saber-rattling rather unnecessary:\n\n\u201cI warmly welcome all the Elders of the Niger Delta and particularly the National Executive of the Ijaw National Congress, under the leadership of Professor Benjamin Okaba. I thank you for paying this courtesy visit not too long after your election in April, and swearing-in last May.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate you all for your election and to add that a lot of responsibility is placed on your shoulders, especially coming from the fact that the Ijaw National Congress was almost without leadership for some time.\n\n\u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people-oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten-point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for the creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, as you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid-down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\u201d",

          "title": "How FG Will Tax Profits Made By Global Tech Giants In Nigeria \u2013 Osinbajo",
          "text": "Nigeria is set to utilise its legal provisions that empower the Federal Government to collect taxes on profits made in the country by global technology and digital firms not based in the country, but with a significant economic presence here.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, (SAN) made this known on Friday, while interacting with a delegation of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), led by its President, Mr Adesina Adedayo who visited him at the Presidential Villa.\n\nWhile noting that the Federal Government will not be raising tax rates at this time, based on the Finance Act 2019, the Vice President said it is already empowered to widen the tax net, including through the collection of taxes on the Nigerian income of global tech giants with significant economic presence here, even if they have not established an office or permanent establishment and are currently not paying taxes in Nigeria.\n\nIn this regard, Section 4 of the Finance Act 2019, provides that \u201cthe Minister (Finance) may by order (of the President) determine what constitutes the significant economic presence of a company other than a Nigerian company,\u201d the VP said.\n\nRead Also: Twitter Gave IPOB Platform To Promote Violence, Lai Mohammed Tells Reps\n\nAccording to Prof. Osinbajo, \u201cwe have had severe economic downturns which of course implies that we may not be able to collect taxes with the aggressiveness that would ordinarily be expected.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that we must widen our tax net so that more people who are eligible to pay tax are paying. Several efforts have been made, and I am sure you are aware of the initiatives including the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) which was also an attempt to bring more people into the tax net, including those who have foreign assets.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the VP said: \u201cwe have also recently taken a step with respect to a lot of the technology companies that are not represented here but who do huge volumes of business here.\n\n\u201cThe Finance Act has shown that we are very prepared to ensure that these big technology companies do not escape without paying their fair share of taxation in Nigeria. Many of them do incredible volumes here in Nigeria and in several other parts of the region.\n\n\u201cWe have drawn up the regulations and we are prepared to go, and I think that we are at least in a good place to tap into some of the tax resources we can get from some of these companies.\u201d\n\nIndeed, besides the FG, a recent Bloomberg news article reported that \u201cgovernments around the world are grappling with how to modernize their legal frameworks to account for the global reach of the digital economy, reshaping how policymakers think about issues as varied as monopoly power, taxation and workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nAlso, international talks are currently ongoing in Paris on global standard rules for governments to receive taxes from such digital and technology firms with significant economic presence in foreign countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, according to the Finance Act 2019, a company will pay taxes if it \u201ctransmits, emits or receives signals, sounds, messages, images or data of any kind by cable, radio, electromagnetic systems, or any other electronic or wireless apparatus to Nigeria in respect of any activity, including electronic commerce, application store, high-frequency trading, electronic data storage, online adverts, participative network platform, online payments and so on, to the extent that the company has significant economic presence in Nigeria and profit can be attributable to such activity.\n\n\u201cIf the trade or business comprises the furnishing of technical, management, consultancy or professional services outside of Nigeria to a person resident in Nigeria to the extent that the company has significant economic presence in Nigeria\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Prof. Osinbajo noted that while the Federal Government has no plans to raise taxes now, there are those who argue that \u201cour tax rates are too low, comparing us to other places in the region where the rates are much higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we have had to balance all of these issues because clearly, higher tax rates can be a disincentive to businesses and investments. In terms of domestic resource mobilization, we are trying to do the best we can, given the present circumstances and I believe that there is room for improvement.\u201d\n\nActually, under the Finance Act 2019, the Buhari administration has reduced taxes for small companies \u2013 companies with less than N25 million in annual turnover are charged Zero Company Income Tax, CIT. Also CIT for companies with revenues between N25 and N100m (described in the Act as \u201cmedium-sized\u201d companies) has been reduced from 30% to 20%. Besides, Nigerians making minimum wage income are not to pay tax at all.\n\nUnder the 2020 Finance Act there is also an exemption of small companies from payment of education tax under the Tertiary Education Trust fund (TETFUND)-meaning companies with less than N25m turnover are eligible\n\nSimilarly, there is a 50% per cent reduction in minimum tax; from 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent for gross turnover for financial years ending between January 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2021\n\nWelcoming the delegation, the Vice President emphasized the need for regular interaction between the council and government to address issues bothering on tax legislation, noting that \u201cthere is need for continuous engagement with the National Assembly because engagement with government cannot be a one-off thing.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo added that the Federal Government has over the past few years, initiated programmes aimed at improving the growth of small businesses including the formalization of many of them. Under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), there is a formalization of 250,000 businesses.\n\nHe said the ongoing MSME Week has encouraged many businesses to register with regulatory authorities in order for them to benefit from the numerous programmes earmarked by the government for their growth.\n\nIn his remarks, the President of the CITN, Mr Adesina Adedayo, commended the leadership of the Vice President in the implementation of key government interventions in the economy, stating that \u201cwe acknowledge your great zeal and commitment to Nigeria project.\u201d\n\nHe said the visit became necessary given the enormous work the Buhari administration has done towards addressing the huge fiscal challenges in the polity, public financing reforms, and sustained efforts towards addressing infrastructural deficit across the country.\n\nRead Also: Falana Faults FG, Says Decision To Meet With Twitter Should Have Come Earlier\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Economic Sustainability Plan (NESP) and other measures implemented was a right response to the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic and were largely instrumental to creating buffers for the government at all levels in withstanding the pressures and waves created during the peak period and the aftermath of COVID-19,\u201d Adebayo said.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we sustain measures already being implemented to improve tax collection at all levels.\u201d\n\nOther members of the delegation included the Vice President of the Institute, Barrister Samuel Olushola Agbeluyi, past Presidents of the institute, Dame Gladys Simplice, and Dr. James Naiyeju, and Council members Prof. Muhammad Mainoma and Hon. Babangida Ibrahim. Mr. Adefisayo Awogbade, CITN Registrar/Chief Executive was also in attendance.",

          "title": "SERAP Asks African Commission To Order FG, NASS To Withdraw Bills To Gag Media",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights in Banjul, The Gambia, to \u201cissue provisional measures to urgently stop the Nigerian government and National Assembly from supporting and pushing through two bills to gag the media, and impose arbitrary and harsh punishment on journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, SERAP said: \u201cthe complaint, addressed to the Chairperson of the Commission Mr Solomon Ayele Dersso, and Commissioner and Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, Ms Jamesina Essie L. King, is brought pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Rule 100 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\u201d\n\nThe complaint followed the move to push through two repressive bills to amend the National Broadcasting Act, and to amend the Nigeria Press Council Act. The bills are reportedly sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Information, Mr Segun Odebunmi (PDP, Oyo State).\n\nDated June 26, 2021, and signed by its Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP said: \u201cThe push by the Nigerian government and the National Assembly to support and pass the two anti-media bills is unlawful, as passing the bills would be contrary to the country\u2019s obligations to respect, protect, promote and fulfill the right to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom under articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter.\u201d\n\nAccording to the rights group, \u201cthese anti-media bills are the latest threats to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom in the country. The bills are not in keeping with the provisions of the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa, which supplements articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cthe Commission has the power to request Provisional Measures from the Nigerian government and National Assembly under Rule 100 of the Rules of Procedure to prevent irreparable harm and threats to human rights including freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom as urgently as the situation demands.\u201d\n\nThe complaint, read in part: \u201cThe bills include retrogressive provisions that threaten human rights, including freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, and could criminalize reporting and give the government overly broad powers and oversight over journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf passed into laws, the bills would be used by those in power to intimidate and harass their critics, and to stifle freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom. The bills would have a chilling effect on the media thereby inducing some measure of self-censorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedia freedom, which is an aspect of the right to freedom of expression, is now generally recognised as an indispensable element of democracy. The mass media promotes the free flow of information, which enables citizens to participate in a meaningful and informed manner in the democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe actions by the Nigerian government and National Assembly are contrary to Articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter, and have thereby violated Nigeria\u2019s positive obligation under Article 1 to recognise the rights, duties and freedoms and to adopt legislative or other measures to give effect to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP regularly relies on the media to carry out its mandate in the promotion of transparency and accountability and respect for socio-economic rights of Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government and National Assembly are directly responsible for pushing the bills that would gag the media and impose harsh punishment on journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in the country, action in violation of the African Charter, and therefore also in violation of Article 1 of the Charter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in the country face a real and immediate risk of violation of their rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom if the anti-media bills are not urgently withdrawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government and National Assembly have failed to produce any evidence that the two bills are necessary or lawful, and in the absence of such, SERAP asks the Commission to order the immediate withdrawal of the bills by Nigerian authorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media also serves as a watchdog by scrutinising and criticising public officials over the way they manage public affairs and public resources. In the performance of these functions, the media\u2019s debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide-open. Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.\u201d\n\n\u201cA free press is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy, one in which journalists are both benefactors and beneficiaries of human rights and carrying out their professional duties to inform their communities and enable democratic participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndividual journalists cannot do their jobs if the institution of the press is compromised or if the legal protections for that institution are subject to approvals by political authorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exhaustion of domestic remedies requirements set out in Article 56(5) of the African Charter has been met. There are no effective or sufficient local remedies available to the Complainant.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian courts do not entertain cases on the legality of anti-media and anti-human rights bills. Also, one of the lawmakers pushing the bills Mr Odebunmi Olusegun has reportedly boasted that \u2018No court will stop us from passing the bills. Requiring SERAP to exhaust domestic remedies in such circumstances would be a mockery of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the bills, the National Broadcasting Commission can shut down TV and radio stations \u201cin the public interest\u201d and the press code must be approved by the Minister of Information. The overly broad definition of public interest opens the door for the Nigerian government to crackdown on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bills would also allow the Nigerian government to jail journalists, fine newspapers up to N10m naira ($20,000) or close them for up to a year if they publish \u201cfake\u201d news. Under the bills, journalists could be held liable for the offence committed by their organisations and can be made to pay heavy fines.\u201d\n\nSERAP, therefore, urged the commission to request the following provisional measures from the Nigerian government and the National Assembly:\n\n1.Immediately withdraw the oppressive bills to gag the media. The first is the bill to amend the National Broadcasting Act, and the second, is the bill to amend the Nigeria Press Council Act.\n\n2.Immediately end harassment and intimidation of journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in Nigeria, and to respect the rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, Unless the African Commission urgently intervenes in this case, there is a risk of irreversible denial of the Complainant\u2019s and Nigerians\u2019 rights, which in turn will render nugatory the resolutions and declarations by the African Commission on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom.\n\n3.Give assurances that they will not support and pass the anti-media bills being pushed by Nigerian authorities. The Nigerian authorities should also give assurances that they will fully implement the resolutions and declarations on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom in the country.\n\n4.Undertake a prompt review of Nigerian legal framework and administrative practices on freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom to ensure their consistency and compatibility with the African Charter, and resolutions and declarations by the African Commission. Pending this, the Nigerian government should take concrete steps to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, and ensure that journalists and media practitioners are able to carry out their work freely, without any intimidation and harassment.",

          "text": "Katsina United have ended the unbeaten run of Akwa United in the Nigeria Professional Football League.\n\nBefore the matchday 29 fixture at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium in Katsina, Akwa United were unbeaten in 18 league matches. A league record.\n\nLosing 1-0 to Rivers United on matchday 28, the Changi Boys were avoiding back-to-back defeats when they filed out to take on the in-form Promise Keepers. The home side stayed true to their winning objective and it paid off in the 15th minute when they were awarded a penalty.\n\nSamuel Kalu stepped up to the spot and scored. 1-0 and it remained that way till half time.\n\nIn the second half, the visitors tried all they could to get something out of the game. In the 71st minute, Charles Okafor sent a long ball to Akarandut Orok inside the box but the striker failed to convert the chance into a goal.\n\nKatsina United won 1-0 and recorded their 10th win of the season. Unbeaten run over for Akwa United but coach Kennedy Boboye\u2019s team still maintained the top position in the league.\n\nIn Bauchi, the early kick-off match between Wikki Tourists and Lobi Stars ended 1-0 in favour of the hosts. Mohammed Guda\u2019s goal from the penalty spot sealed victory for Wikki, a team in desperate need of victories to avoid the relegation zone. They are currently 15th on the log.\n\nAt the Pantami Stadium in Gombe, Adamawa United showed they will not go down without a fight. The bottom-placed team beat Jigawa Golden Stars to record just their 5th win of the season.\n\nAt the New Jos Stadium, the star match between Plateau United and Enyimba Football Club of Aba ended in a goalless draw. As regards movement on the table, the result didn\u2019t harm both sides so much but win for the People\u2019s Elephant would have shot them into the top four. They are fifth on the log but tied on 49 points with Kwara United.\n\nSadly, another show of fans misconduct was displayed as some players of Enyimba were attacked and injured.\n\nDominant Home Wins\n\nSince moving to the Ahmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna, Kano Pillars are making it a fortress and getting better match after match. They have drawn just two games at the venue against Rangers and Akwa United.\n\nAfter a disappointing 1-0 loss to Jigawa Golden Stars on matchday 28, Sai Masu Gida needed to get back to winning ways. Going against an unpredictable FC Ifeanyi Ubah team, Coach Ibrahim Musa\u2019s team erased all forms of complacency to get the job done.\n\nDavid Ebuka scored in the 27th minute was good enough to secure victory and give Sai Masu Gida their 15th win of the season, they are third on the log, tied on 52 points with second-placed Nasarawa United, and with their dominant home form, they are still a top contender for the league title.\n\nIn Ilorin, Kwara United continued their dominant home form with a 1-0 win over struggling Sunshine Stars of Akure. The Harmony Boys who are unbeaten at home this season took the lead in the 7th minute via Michael Ohanu\u2019s goal. They held on to the lone goal to record their 14th win of the season and returned into the top four on the league table. Coach Abdullahi Biffo\u2019s team is still the surprise package of the season. It\u2019s the 14th loss of the season for Sunshine Stars who are well placed in the relegation zone.\n\nIn Lafia, Nasarawa United showed class to record a 2-1 victory over Rivers United. The Solid Miners are having fun at home, they score goals and record convincing victories. So far, they hold the record of highest goalscoring team in the league.\n\nMotivated from matchday 28 goalless draw result with Enyimba in Aba, Coach Bala Nikyu\u2019s team needed to consolidate on that performance against Rivers United and they did. Chigozie Obasi opened the scoring for the home side in the 23rd minute while Michael Udeh doubled the lead in the 61st minute. Godwin Aguda pulled one back for the visitors from the spot but that was how far they could go.\n\nNasarawa United held on to win 2-1 and moved to second on the log. It\u2019s the 16th win of the season for the Solid Miners and they moved to second position on the log.\n\nWith just one home defeat, Heartland FC is another team with good home performance. Today, they did the double-over MFM with a 2-0 win at the Dan Anyiam Stadium. On matchday 9, the Naze Millionaires beat MFM 1-2 at the Agege Stadium. It was the first home defeat for the Olukoya Boys this season.\n\nThe reverse fixture provided an opportunity for the Lagos-based team to avenge that loss but with the home superiority of Heartland, it was a difficult task. As early as the 5th minute, Chidera Eze opened scoring for the hosts and in the closing minutes of the game, Kingsley Maduforo scored to seal victory for coach Fidelis Ilechukwu\u2019s team who are now 10th on the log with 41 points.\n\nVital Away Victories\n\nIn Ozoro, the struggle continued for Warri Wolves. Just 2 weeks ago, they lost at home to Dakkada FC, today, they fell at home again. A 67th-minute goal scored by Christian Nnaji gave Rangers International Football Club a vital 1-0 victory over sinking Warri Wolves. It is the 16th time the Wolves are losing this season, they are 19th on the log and will need a miracle to survive relegation.\n\nDakkada FC recorded their third away win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Abia Warriors at the Okigwe Township Stadium. Issac George scored in the 76th minute to give the Chosen Ones another crucial win on the road and inflict the third defeat in a row on the Warriors.\n\nThis is the second defeat to Abia Warriors in Okigwe. Before losing to Enyimba in a rescheduled fixture last week, they were unbeaten at home. Coach Imama Amapakabo\u2019s team have now lost 10 times this season while Dakkada FC recorded their 12th win of the season.\n\nNIGERIA PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE\n\nMatchday 29 Results\n\nKatsina United 1 Akwa United 0\n\nWikki Tourists 1 Lobi Stars 0\n\nAdamawa United 2 Jigawa Golden Stars 0\n\nPlateau United 0 Enyimba FC 0\n\nKano Pillars 1 FC Ifeanyi Ubah 0\n\nKwara United 1 Sunshine Stars 0\n\nNasarawa United 2 Rivers United 1\n\nHeartland FC 2 MFM FC 0\n\nWarri Wolves 0 Rangers Int\u2019l FC 1\n\nAbia Warriors 0 Dakkada FC 1",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the Niger Delta Avengers, who recently emerged and threatened to blow critical oil and gas installations in the region unless specific demands were met.\n\nA statement released on Sunday by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity said it was curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe media was Sunday awash with threats and demands by a group, Niger Delta Avengers, to embark on economic sabotage through bombing of critical oil and gas installations unless certain demands, including development of the Niger Delta, and restructuring of the Federation, were met.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\n\u201cFor clarity and record purposes, below is full text of the speech by President Buhari on Friday, June 25, 2021, which renders any sabre-rattling rather unnecessary:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI warmly welcome all the Elders of the Niger Delta and particularly the National Executive of the Ijaw National Congress, under the leadership of Professor Benjamin Okaba. I thank you for paying this courtesy visit not too long after your election in April, and swearing-in last May.\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate you all for your election and to add that a lot of responsibility is placed on your shoulders, especially coming from the fact that the Ijaw National Congress was almost without leadership for some time.\n\n\u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the HydroCarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The world\u2019s number-one ranked side Belgium take on holders Portugal in a standout Euro 2020 tie in Spain for a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nAll eyes will be on Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku and Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, who have scored eight goals between them at Euro 2020.\n\nRonaldo, who is the tournament\u2019s leading scorer on five goals, is one away from setting a new men\u2019s record for most national team goals.\n\nThe last-16 tie takes place in Seville.\n\nLeicester City\u2019s Youri Tielemans could return for the match, which will include extra-time and penalties if it is level after 90 and 120 minutes respectively. Tielemans started the first two group wins but did not play against Finland.\n\nWolves defender Nelson Semedo picked up a knock in Portugal\u2019s last outing against France but has since returned to training.\n\nManchester United\u2019s Bruno Fernandes is hoping to return to the starting line-up after being dropped to the bench for the last game.\n\nDespite being top of Fifa\u2019s world rankings, Belgium have yet to win a major tournament.\n\nAlong with Italy and the Netherlands, Roberto Martinez\u2019s team were one of three sides to finish the group stage with a maximum nine points.\n\nWhile Italy and the Netherlands played their three games at \u2018home\u2019 in Rome and Amsterdam respectively, Belgium overcame Russia in St Petersburg, came from behind to beat Denmark in Copenhagen before returning to St Petersburg to defeat Finland.\n\nEuro 2016 winners Portugal made it through to the last 16 as one of the best four third-placed teams.\n\nThey lost to Germany 4-2 in Munich after winning 3-0 in Hungary before a dramatic 2-2 draw with world champions France in Budapest.\n\nSince the end of the 2018 World Cup, Lukaku has scored 23 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions for Belgium, while also providing four assists.\n\nThe Inter Milan forward netted three goals in the group stage, including two in one match against Russia.\n\nRonaldo, 36, is now the top-scoring European player at major tournaments (World Cup and European Championship), with his double against France in the last game moving him beyond Miroslav Klose (19) to 21 goals.\n\nIndeed, that was Ronaldo\u2019s second double of Euro 2020 already \u2013 no player has registered three in a single tournament at the European Championship.\n\n\u201cAt his age, he continues to shine and I\u2019m going to try and get as close to his achievements as possible,\u201d Lukaku, 28, said of his Portuguese rival.\n\nBoth sides have got plenty of match-winners, capable of a moment of genius. I\u2019d argue Belgium have the edge going forward but their defence has got mistakes in them.\n\nIt is very difficult to call, and I think this will be settled by a penalty shoot-out.\n\nSimon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen\u2019s Gracenote: Belgium are the top-ranked club in Europe according to Gracenote\u2019s World Ranking, ahead of France, Italy and Portugal.\n\nProgress to the last 16 has increased Belgium\u2019s chance of winning the tournament from 14.1% to 15% but they are now second favourites due to being in the tougher half of the draw.\n\nPortugal have been unlucky with the draw in this tournament, firstly ending up in Group F with France and Germany, and now having to face Belgium in the last 16.\n\nPortugal\u2019s Gracenote World Football Ranking of fourth in Europe implies that they are capable of a semi-final place but they first have to knock out a team who are theoretically better than them.\n\nThis is the first meeting between Belgium and Portugal at a major tournament.\n\nPortugal are unbeaten in their past five matches against Belgium across all competitions (W3 D2) since a 3-0 defeat in World Cup qualifying in September 1989.\n\nBelgium have only failed to score in two of their last 58 games under Roberto Martinez.\n\nDespite playing just 134 minutes so far, Kevin de Bruyne has been involved in three of Belgium\u2019s seven goals at Euro 2020, netting once and providing two assists.\n\nBelgium\u2019s victory over Finland last time out marked their ninth win at a World Cup and European Championship combined under Roberto Martinez, with the Spaniard now holding the outright managerial record for major tournament wins with the Red Devils.\n\nPortugal have conceded six goals in three games at Euro 2020 so far, already one more than they did at Euro 2016 when they went on to lift the trophy.\n\nPortugal have qualified for the knockout stages of the European Championship in third place for the second tournament in a row, also doing so in 2016 before going on to win it.\n\nPortugal\u2019s return of four points from three group games is the poorest return for a defending champion at a European Championship since Greece in 2008.",

          "text": "Donald Trump has held his first campaign-style rally since leaving the White House, repeating his election grievances and baseless claims of fraud as he urged his supporters to help Republicans win back majorities in the United States Congress.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally in Ohio \u2013 a state the former president carried in the 2020 election \u2013 marks a return to the kind of freewheeling mass gatherings that have been critical to retaining the support of his base.\n\nIt was held to support Max Miller, a former White House aide who is challenging Republican Representative Anthony Gonzalez for his congressional seat. Gonzalez was one of 10 Republican House members who voted to impeach Trump for his role in inciting the January 6 attack on the US Capitol in the wake of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has pledged to back those who challenge the 10 legislators in the upcoming Republican primaries.\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress will be on the line in the 2022 midterm elections and history favors Republicans\u2019 chances of gaining seats in those contests.\n\n\u201cWe will take back the House, we will take back the Senate, and we will take back America, and we will do it soon,\u201d Trump told thousands of cheering supporters at Ohio\u2019s Lorain County Fairgrounds.\n\nSo far, nine of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment have drawn primary challengers. The former president has offered to support anyone who steps forward to challenge the remaining candidate, Representative John Katko of New York, according to the website syracuse.com.\n\nTrump has also endorsed a challenger to Senator Lisa Murkowski, the only one of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict him in his January impeachment trial who is up for re-election in 2022.\n\nThe Ohio event in Wellington, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Cleveland, was the first of three public appearances, followed by a trip to the US-Mexico border on June 30 and a rally in Sarasota, Florida, on July 3.\n\nWhile Trump praised Miller as an \u201cincredible patriot\u201d and a \u201cgreat guy\u201d who \u201cloves the people of Ohio,\u201d he spent much of his 90-minute address fixating on the 2020 election, which he insists he won, even though top state and local election officials, his own attorney general and numerous judges, including some he appointed, have said there is no evidence of the mass voter fraud he alleges took place.\n\n\u201cThis was the scam of the century and this was the crime of the century,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe 2020 presidential election was rigged. We won that election in a landslide.\u201d\n\nThe crowd chanted \u201cTrump won\u201d and \u201cfour more years! four more years!\u201d. But the former president made no clear mention of his political future.\n\nHe did however tease the crowd at one point by alluding to the possibility of another stab at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe may have to win it a third time. It is possible,\u201d he said.\n\nA supporter waits for former President Donald Trump to speak at a rally at the Lorain County Fairgrounds, Saturday, June 26, 2021, in Wellington, Ohio [Tony Dejak/ AP]\n\nWhether Trump runs again could be influenced by the outcome of various legal troubles.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan informed his company on Thursday that it could soon face criminal charges stemming from a wide-ranging investigation into the former president\u2019s business dealings. The New York Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that charges could be filed against the Trump Organization within days.\n\nTrump has denounced the investigations as nothing more than a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d aimed at damaging him politically.\n\nThe former president also used the Ohio rally to lambast Biden, calling him a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d and focusing on the rising number of immigrants crossing over the US southern border \u2013 an issue Republicans have zeroed in on to rally their voters.\n\n\u201cYou have millions of people coming into our country. We have no idea who they are. Joe Biden is doing the exact opposite as we did,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is destroying our nation before our very eyes,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s rallies have been instrumental to his politics since he launched his 2016 campaign and his supporters in Ohio said they hoped he would use such events to help unify the party behind like-minded candidates for Congress.\n\n\u201cContinuing these rallies is extremely important,\u201d said Jessica Dicken, a 30-year-old stay-at-home mother from southeast Ohio, adding Trump could be \u201ca voice for the more conservative movement here in Ohio and across the nation\u201d.\n\nChris Laskowski, 55, who lives in Medina, Ohio, said she missed Trump.\n\n\u201cI think they robbed him of the election and he\u2019s still our president.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated false claims of election fraud have taken hold of the Republican Party, with 53 percent of Republican voters saying they believe Trump won the 2020 election, according to a Reuters/ Ipsos poll. They blamed his loss on illegal voting, the poll found.\n\nRepublican strategist Matt Dole said both Trump and those vying to stay close to him benefited from the public bonhomie on display at the Ohio event. Some of the candidates now seeking his endorsement have made disparaging comments about Trump in the past.\n\n\u201cThese are marriages of convenience,\u201d said Dole, who is based in Ohio. \u201cDonald Trump is using these opportunities to keep his name out there, to keep the base motivated.\u201d",

          "text": "Authorities in several countries \u2013 from Bangladesh and Indonesia to Australia and Israel \u2013 are racing to contain the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, while Russia\u2019s Saint Petersburg announced a record death toll, laying bare the challenges faced by nations worldwide in their efforts to return to pre-pandemic life.\n\nWhile vaccination campaigns have brought down infections in mostly wealthy nations, the rise of the Delta variant has stoked fears of new waves of a virus that has already killed nearly four million people.\n\n\u201cThere is currently a lot of concern about the Delta variant,\u201d World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a Friday news briefing.\n\n\u201cDelta is the most transmissible of the variants identified so far, has been identified in at least 85 countries and is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations.\u201d\n\nIn Bangladesh, authorities announced they would impose a new national lockdown from Monday over the variant, with offices shut for a week and only medical-related transport allowed.\n\nAustralia\u2019s largest city Sydney, meanwhile, entered a two-week lockdown, with people ordered to stay home except for essential trips.\n\nSydney\u2019s new restrictions apply to some five million people, along with hundreds of thousands of others living in nearby towns.\n\nNew Zealand, citing \u201cmultiple outbreaks\u201d in Australia, announced a three-day suspension of its quarantine-free travel arrangement with its larger neighbour.\n\nAustralia\u2019s COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the suspension would give officials time to consider measures \u201cto make the bubble safer, such as pre-departure testing for all flights\u201d between the two countries.\n\nIn Indonesia, President Joko Widodo said the country of 270 million people was facing an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d and pledged to respond with \u201cquick and appropriate policies\u201d. The country recorded more than 21,000 new infections on Saturday, the highest daily tally yet.\n\nDelta, which was first identified in India in April, is so contagious that experts say more than 80 percent of a population would need to be inoculated in order to contain it \u2013 a challenging target even for nations with significant vaccination programmes.\n\nThe variant is now responsible for more than 90 percent of all new infections in the United Kingdom and about 30 percent in the United States.\n\nEuropean scientists estimate Delta is 40 to 60 percent more contagious than the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), first discovered in the United Kingdom, which itself was more infectious than the original virus first detected in late 2019.\n\n\u201cIt infects more people, it can spread faster,\u201d vaccinologist Dr Annelies Wilder Smith, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe saw it in India. We\u2019re seeing it in Australia and Indonesia, in the UK. And I think we\u2019ll see now increasingly in Europe, and indeed, also in the Americas,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it really also causes more severe disease has not yet been confirmed. So if you see more disease you will also see more hospitalisations \u2013 that does not mean that the virus itself causes more severe disease.\u201d\n\nExperts say Delta spreads more easily because of mutations that help it latch onto cells in the body. While several studies have shown that vaccines are slightly less effective against Delta, they are still highly effective \u2013 but only after the second dose.\n\nIsrael, which has one of the world\u2019s most successful vaccination campaigns, has seen infections linked to the variant surge since dropping a requirement to wear masks in enclosed public places 10 days ago.\n\nAfter four days of more than 100 new cases a day, the health ministry has now reversed that decision.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s Euro 2020 host Saint Petersburg on Saturday reported the country\u2019s highest daily COVID-19 death toll for a city since the start of the pandemic.\n\nOfficial figures said Saint Petersburg, which has already hosted six matches of the football tournament and is due to host a quarter-final on Friday, recorded 107 virus deaths during the past 24 hours.\n\nAuthorities in the Russian city tightened anti-coronavirus restrictions last week in an effort to curb the spike in new infections, including closing food courts in the city\u2019s shopping malls and its Euro 2020 fan zone. This came as Russia has seen an explosion of new cases since mid-June, driven by the Delta variant.\n\nIn neighbouring Finland, health officials said they had detected a spike in coronavirus infections that was traced to football fans returning from Saint Petersburg. The Finnish health institute\u2019s director, Mika Salminen, told public broadcaster YLE that more than 120 cases have so far been identified from passengers returning from the Russian city, mostly football fans, and the number is likely to increase.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Paul Brennan, reporting from London, said there have been concerns about a link between the tournament and COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\u201cAttendance at these stadiums has been pre-conditional on you actually showing a negative coronavirus test. But that doesn\u2019t stop people\u2019s mingling in the streets and mixing with other members of the public who don\u2019t have to go through these tests,\u201d he said.\n\nElsewhere, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned infections were also surging at an alarming rate in at least 12 countries in Africa, with the Delta variant leading to unprecedented hospitalisations.\n\nAccording to the WHO, only one percent of Africans are fully vaccinated \u2013 the lowest ratio globally.\n\nIn South Africa, the continent\u2019s worst-hit country, scientists said on Saturday the Delta variant appeared to be dominating new infections. On Friday, authorities registered 18,000 new cases.\n\nActing Health Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane told the same news conference that it was now likely that the peak of the third wave would surpass the peak of the second wave in January.\n\nIn Europe, however, some countries announced the lifting of restrictions even as scientists have warned that Delta was expected to account for 90 percent of all new cases in the European Union by the end of August.\n\nSpain on Saturday brought an end to mandatory outdoor mask-wearing, a year after the rule was first introduced.\n\nThe decision came despite the announcement of a major coronavirus cluster in the capital, Madrid, traced to a student trip to the holiday island of Mallorca, with more than 2,000 people ordered to self-isolate.\n\nThe Netherlands also ended its rules on outdoor mask-wearing, while easing restrictions on indoor dining and reopening nightclubs to people who have tested negative.\n\nAnd Switzerland scrapped most of its remaining coronavirus restrictions on Saturday after Health Minister Alain Berset said this week that the country\u2019s use of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines gave adequate protection against the Delta variant.",
