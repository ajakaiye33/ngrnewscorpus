          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nThe Coordinator at the Bone Marrow Registry Nigeria, Dr. Emmanuel Nna, says sickle cell disease can be cured with a bone marrow transplant, noting that people with this health condition should explore the option.\n\nDr. Nna also stated that a bone marrow transplant can equally help in the treatment of many invasive cancers.\n\nHe, however, said only a few Nigerians have undergone the genetic test used to identify certain individual variations in a person\u2019s immune system (Human Leukocyte Antigen typing) which is crucial to bone marrow transplant.\n\nVery few people, he added, are also willing to donate stem cells.\n\nAccording to the BMRN coordinator, the bone marrow is rich in stem cells which are capable of regenerating cells in people who have leukaemia and other life-threatening diseases including solid cancers.\n\nA blood stem cell transplant is a procedure used to replace damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone marrow blood stem cells.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Dr. Nna said contrary to the assumptions of some people, individuals with a tattoo or piercing can be blood stem cell donors.\n\nHe, however, stated that such individuals with a tattoo or piercing have to wait a year after undergoing the act before they can donate blood stem cells.\n\nHe also added that those who have regular tattoos, piercings, or people who have been exposed to Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, or have been injected with illegal or non-prescriptive drugs cannot be blood stem cells donor.\n\n\u201cThe stem cells in the bone marrow are capable of replicating (divide and yield specialised cells) which can cure blood cancers.\n\n\u201cOver four million Nigerians suffer sickle cell disease which is curable by marrow stem cell transplant.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, 66.4 per 100,000 men and 130.6 per 100,000 women suffer invasive cancers. A lot of these can be treated by stem cell transplant,\u201d he said.\n\nInvasive cancers are cancers that have grown past the original tissue or cells where they developed and spread to otherwise healthy surrounding tissue.\n\nThe physician noted that with stem cell donation from the blood, there is very little pain involved.\n\n\u201cIt is very similar to donating platelets and there is absolutely no operation whatsoever. A cell separator machine is used to collect stem cells from your blood. The life-saving bone marrow stem cells are found in your bloodstream. A cell separator machine is used to collect stem cells from your blood,\u201d he said.\n\nNna, who is also the Director-General of the Molecular Pathology Institute, Enugu, added that through the Match and Search Services, the BMRN has access to the World Marrow Donor Association Registry that houses over 39 million potential donors worldwide and the BMRN can help an intending recipient to search this registry for his or her donor match.\n\nHe said \u201cPotential informed consented donors, aged 18-50 years can have a free HLA typing if they are willing to donate marrow stem cells in the future. The HLA typing is free of charge for the potential donors to enroll in the registry.\n\n\u201cThe BMRN is a member of the WMDA. Through its membership, it can always arrange donations once a recipient-donor match is found. Through BMRN partners, intending recipients can have a highly discounted high-resolution HLA typing to start their journey towards finding a perfect match for donation.\n\n\u201cThe BMRN is at the forefront of promoting transplant science in Nigeria. Through awareness lectures, donor drive, and research. We urge Nigerians to support and join the BMRN in this laudable effort. The BMRN also submits HLA results of informed consented potential donors to the WMDA registry. This helps to expand the global registry.\u201d\n\nHe noted that people can walk into the UNN Centre for Clinical Trials building to enlist and get swabs for HLA typing as a potential donor.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Robert Okubo\n\n\u2022I built boreholes in Inikorogha community; gave jobs to 418 youths\n\n\u2022Insists.. \u2018all allegations against me are false\u2019\n\nEXMILITANT leader and former Senior Special Assistant, SSA, Surveillance/Waterways Security, in Edo State, RobertOkubo, has said he was prepared to meet with former general officer commanding, GOC, defunct\n\nMovement for Emancipation of Niger-Delta, MEND, Government Ekpemupolo, alias Tompolo, over complaints against him by elders of his community, Inikorogha, in\n\nOvia South-West Local Government area of Edo State.\n\n\n\nElders of Inikorogha had visited Tompolo at Oporoza, traditional headquarters of Gbaramatu Kingdom, in Warri South-West Local Government Area of Delta State,\n\nsome weeks ago, urging him, as the generalissimo of Niger-Delta struggle, to call Okubo to order.\n\nIn his response to NDV inquiry, sent through a go-between, Robert Okubo, who restated his innocence in the entire saga, stated: \u201cYes, it is the rights of every individual to report to whoever you want when you are angry. Tompolo is a leader and father to us, anybody can report to him. One thing I know Tompolo for is that he knows when you lie to him andhe does his own independent investigation into any matter before\n\nhim.\n\n\u201cIf Tompolo asks me to come, I will go because I do not have anything I am hiding. Tompolo knows that I have developed Inikorogha community and he likes such\n\nthings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former SSA who reaffirmed that he provided boreholes for Inikorogha community added that he gave job to 418 youths.\n\nAmaokosuwei not against me He debunked the claim that the Amaokosuwei of the community, Joseph Megbuwei, was against him, saying: \u201cSome greedy PDP people are only trying to use the Amaokosuwei name against me.\n\nThe Amaokosuwei to be has come up to deny everything they used his name to publish against my person and I have the video recording to that effect.\u201d\n\n\n\nOkubo further stated: It is not true that I am using those that I gave appointments in the past to intimidate anyone. It is not correct and I want all those carrying such\n\nfalse news to prove it.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t collect revenue for Inikorogha\n\nHis words: \u201cI do not collect and I have never collected any revenue for Inikorogha community.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe community has their revenue\n\ncollectors who are collecting revenue for the community. The\n\nAmaokosuwei is not the community treasurer and as such, revenue cannot be remitted to the Amaokosuwei, but to the community treasurer or chairman. We have an existing constitution that guides the community.\u201d\n\nPotoki lied against me\n\n\n\nHe denied the claim by a former security officer and community leader, Madam Victoria Potoki, that she linked him to Government House for his appointment as SSA\n\nto ex-governor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, pointing out: \u201cIt was the then Commissioner of Police, Edo State, Danladi Yar\u2019dua and the then deputy director of DSS, Edo State, Mr. Osuji, who introduced me to the Comrade Adams Aliu\n\nOshiomhole for appointment because of how I was assisting the security agents to fight crimes in Edo State.\n\n\u201cThe security agents are aware of all these facts. I was the first to embrace the Federal Government Amnesty programme on the pages of newspaper on the 4th of August, 2009 and Andrew Igiri is aware of all these facts.\n\nI only called Madam Victoria Potoki to follow me on a courtesy visit to Oshiomhole.\n\n\u201cAll what she said about me was never correct. Oshiomhole is still alive, the then commissioner of Police Yar\u2019dua who retired as AIG is still alive, the then DSS deputy\n\ndirector Mr. Osuji is still very much alive and Andrew Igiri is still alive. You can confirm from them.\n\nHow can someone who brought Ijaw women together in the name of politics and collected the only two appointments given to the body to herself and her\n\ngrandson? That was what led to the fall of that body during Oshiomhole regime as a governor of Edo State.

          "title": "Ndokwa nation seeks chairmanship of APC, writes Buni",
          "text": ".\n\nA Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC in Delta State, Steve Ossai Uweh, has called on the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to consider ceding the Chairmanship slot of the party in the state a politician of Ndokwa extraction noting that it is the only to get overwhelming support from the people of Ndokwa/Ukwani Federal constituency.\n\nThis was revealed in a September 18, 2021 dated letter addressed to the Chairman of the party\u2019s Caretaker Committee who doubles as the governor of Yobe State, Buni stating that the least the people of the three local areas of Ndokwa nation, which he described in his letter as the second largest homogenous entity in the oil-rich state will accept from the broom party to produce in the forthcoming state Congress is a Chairman of Ndokwa extraction.\n\nHe reeled out the advantages inherent in the emergence of a Chairman of Ndokwa extraction to include massive support from the people of his federal constituency and stressing that making a Ndokwa person a chairman will go a long way to assuage the ill feelings and suspicions of ethnic supremacy in the broom party.\n\nChief Uweh, who is a leader and co-founder of the Organisation for Ndokwa Unity otherwise known as Ndokwa Unite, a pan Ndokwa nationalist movement argues that the Ndokwa nation has suffered age-long marginalisation and deliberate neglect by successive governments in the past owing to non-recognition of the Ndokwa bloc by the political party that forms the government.\n\nRecall that leaders of APC in Ndokwa nation had on June 18, 2021, at Abbi warned the party leadership not to toy with the solidarity and loyalty of Ndokwa people as it demanded at that well-attended gathering that Ndokwa politician be made the party Chairman to overwhelmingly get the support of the people.\n\nNdokwa nation, Uweh said, will not fold its arms and sheepishly follow any group into the election without adequately protecting the interest of the Ukwuani and Aboh speaking Deltans.\n\nHe noted that, there\u2019s no gain saying the fact that the people of Ndokwa nation are massively drifting to the APC with the understanding that their national interest will be paramount to the party leaders at both the state and national level, he maintained that the party should equally give the people a commensurate position to justify their solidarity to the party.\n\nAccording to the letter: \u201cNdokwa ethnic nationality is the 2nd largest ethnic group in Delta state and its is made up of the present Ndokwa East, Ndokwa West and Ukwuani Local Government Areas of the Delta State, which constitute the Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency. It is approximately the same area previously referred to as Aboh Division (less the areas carved into Rivers and other Divisions) in Midwest Region.\n\n\u201cAboh Division was in the old Delta Province with the Urhobos (who presently occupy Delta Central Senatorial District) and the Isokos, Ijaws and Itsekiris (who presently occupy the Delta South Senatorial District). The three Ndokwa LGAs are presently in Delta North Senatorial District with Ika, Aniocha and Oshimili peoples. Ndokwa shares geographical and cultural affinities with these sister nationalities and is seen as the bridge and stabilizer of the peoples of Delta State.\n\n\u201cEconomically, Ndokwa, which harbours Nigeria\u2019s first Gas Recycling Plant (IPP, built by Nigeria Agip Oil Company, NAOC) bears the largest reserves of natural gas in the entire West African sub-region (Nigeria\u2019s future hope) and produces over 110,000 barrels of crude oil per day from various oil fields in the area. The NAOC IPP in Okpai, Ndokwa East, contributes 480MW to the national grid or 15% of total electricity generation in Nigeria. The area is, however, still in the dark as power has not been stepped down.\u201d The statement reads in part.\n\nThe Utagba-Uno \u2013 born Chieftain of the APC further averred that; \u201cNatural Gas from these Agip plants, many oil field and gas fields in Ndokwa land are piped through hundreds of kilometres to feed the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) in Bonny, Rivers State for exports. The NLNG Train 7 that will bring about $10 billion of Foreign Direct Investment into Nigeria recently commissioned by H.E President M. Buhari would be harvesting most of her gas from gas Ndokwa land.\n\n\u201cNdokwa is seriously marginalized as none of her sons or daughters has been considered for appointment by the FG either as Minister, Special Adviser, Ambassador, statutory federal boards\u2026 Ndokwa land and her people have however remained active but peaceful and loyal to the Nigerian authority. In recent and contemporary times, Ndokwa sons have been moving into the All Progressives Congress (APC), in the determination to take Delta State into the Progressives family.\n\n\u201cCurrently there is no Federal institution in Ndokwa land except Prisons and NIPOST that was established in the colonial era.\n\n\n\nOur people have been excited since the news for the establishment of Federal University of Agriculture and Technology, Aboh was read in the National Assembly recently we hope and pray it\u2019s passed and gets presidential assent.\n\n\n\n\u201d It is on the basis of these facts, and the political capital to be gained that we request for the position of State Chairman for the APC in the forthcoming congress of the Party. We assure all that we have capable and able persons to steer the Party\u2019s ship to victory if given the opportunity. We know that congresses are election driven, but we count on the prior understandings and endorsements that make such an election a formality and build the needed consensus for the ensuing election of 2nd October 2021 of our Party State Congress\n\n\u201cSir, we will produce on-demand copies of letters, petitions, press releases and presentations we have made on Ndokwa marginalization to this government and successive government for your kind perusal in your spare time as we don\u2019t want to bore you with details for now.\n\n\u201cNdokwa APC leaders and leadership of Organization for Ndokwa Unity aka Ndokwa Unite met at Abbi in June and resolve to seek for the Position of State Chairmanship of APC it was shocking reading the zoning arrangement announced by acting state Chairman-Prophet Jones Erhue and till date, no leader in APC was consulted before the zoning,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

What is left now is Anambra State. Because from the letter they have written, OPL 915 and 916 are in our area.\n\n\u201cI want to put on record here that since the RMAFC has accorded recognition to our neighbours, Kogi and Anambra, they should extend same to Enugu State, so that there will be peace.\u201d",

          "text": "Former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha has revealed why he refused to order his men to shoot and kill members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, during his tenure.\n\nThe former Governor called on the Buhari Government to sympathise with the youth and address their grievances.\n\nSpeaking further, the lawmaker called on the people of the South-East region to present a good reason they should be given the opportunity to produce the next President of the country in 2023.\n\nOkorocha, who represents Imo West Senatorial District at the National Assembly, said this during \u2018Conversation with Owelle Rochas Okorocha at 59 and Award of Icon of Service and Philanthropy,\u2019 aired by NTA.\n\n\u201cWhen IPOB started, they came to Imo State when I was the governor, but I listened to them and understood their grievances.\n\n\u201cThey asked me to join them, and I told them if they can convince me to have another (Biafra country) passport, I will join.\n\n\u201cI could have asked my men to shoot them as they were killed in Okigwe and other states, but no. I had to listen to know what they were going through.\n\n\u201cThat is how the Nigerian government should treat the youths, sympathise with them. Treat them well,\u201d Okorocha said.\n\nRecently, many youths have been reportedly killed while many others have been arrested and jailed by Nigerian security operatives.\n\nSpeaking with DAILY POST on the recent happenings in the South East, especially Imo State, a security expert in Aba, Abia State, Dr. Maxwell Uchenna, apportioned most of the blames on the incumbent Imo State governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma.\n\nAccording to him, the Governor is rather taking instructions from Abuja in the matters of security of his state instead of seeking a local solution to what he( Uchenna) described as a local problem.\n\n\u201cHope Uzodinma is an Igbo man who should understand Igbo problems better,\u201d he told DAILY POST.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m not in any way in support of youths who go about killing security operatives and destroying government institutions should not be dealt with. But it\u2019s wrong to kill them extrajudicially. It is unconstitutional to order the shooting of Nigerian youths without proper investigations and trials.\n\n\u201cIn this same country we see bandits being arrested and detained by the security forces; we see Boko Haram members being integrated into the society by the government, so why will the South East be different? Why should the agitating youths be shot on sight with arresting and trying them in a court of competent jurisdiction? There\u2019s insecurity everywhere in Nigeria and the government must rise to the occasion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about Okorocha\u2019s claim of having listened to the Biafra agitators during his tenure but all I can tell you is that it is unlawful for a sitting governor to order the shooting and killing of his people in order to look good before the central government and his political party.\u201d",

          "text": "From Isaac Anumihe (Abuja) Adewale Sanyaolu and Merit Ibe\n\nMore difficult times await Nigerians in the months ahead as the Federal Government yesterday announced it is ending the N30 billion monthly electricity subsidy by January 2022.\n\nThe decision is also to affect all forms of subsidies hitherto extended to operators in the power sector value chain.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on infrastructure, Ahmed Zakari, disclosed this at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement meeting, organised by the Nigerian Electricity Commission (NERC) in Lagos.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, had last July said the government expected the electricity sector to generate its revenue from the power sector market.\n\nThe VP noted that government would be investing over N43 billion in the coming years to improve transmission and distribution infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe power industry in Nigeria has reportedly been bugged down by claims of revenue shortfall allegedly due to a tariff regime that is \u201cnot cost reflective.\u201d Data from the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) shows that the tariff being collected by DisCos is below 50 per cent of their invoices.\n\nThe Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED) had consistently lamented that the absence of of a cost reflective remained one of the major setbacks confronting the sector.\n\nZakari, stated that the \u201cFederal Government intends to reduce its interventions in the power sector and thus allow the electricity market forces to to determine the course of action.\u201d\n\nStakeholders have argued that allowing market operators to determine the course of action simply means that Nigerians are to pay the full commercial price for power as determined by the generating and distribution companies.\n\nOne of the participants at that public hearing and Executive Director, Center for Transparency & Accountability in the Energy Sector, Barrister Abel Godson, stated that, \u201cwith the deteriorating nature of electricity supply in the country, coupled with a deteriorating and ageing infrastructure within the electricity network, government\u2019s pre-occupation should be about stabilizing the market, and not tariff hike.\u201d He also maintained that, \u201cpromoting cost reflective tariff at a time where the country is battling one its worst forex regimes and high inflation rates, which affect the cost of goods and services, will be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cIf this current precarious situation is met with any form of hike in electricity tariff, then we can bid goodbye to any meaningful development in the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Federal Government and Organised Labour had gone into extensive discussions prior to the implementation of the Service Based Tarrif in November 2020, where the electricity regulator (NERC) had promised improvement in service delivery to Nigerians.\n\nZakari noted that Nigeria has one of the poorest supply of electricity despite the power sector contributing 78 per cent to GDP growth for Q2 2021.\n\nBut reacting to the planned hike in electricity tariff, President, Consumer Rights Advancement Organisation(CRADO), Chief Adeolu Ogunbanjo, said consumers will mobilise the Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) against this insensitive pronouncement which is anti-people.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr Frank Onyebu, Chairman, MAN, Apapa branch said, \u201c I\u2019m not against the removal of subsidy , but we need to look at it in a better context.\n\nThere is so much inefficiency in the electricity industry leading to much of the power generated being wasted, while DisCos want consumers to pay for their inefficiency.\n\nIf they run their firms as expected, there won\u2019t be need for subsidy because I believe the current tariff which is already high is adequate. We are still talking about tariffs because the handlers are still looking at the industry as old \u2018NEPA\u2019. They are not running the industry as a private concern . If they run it efficiently as a private organisation, they will realise that there is no need for subsidy.\n\nThere is really no subsidy on electricity, efficiency needs ro be improved upon.\n\nIn his reaction, a lawyer and economy expert, Mr Eze Onyekpere, said he does not see any reason government should subsidise the inefficiency of the GenCos and DisCos with public fund, stressing that such funds should be channelled into productive consumption. \u201cWhat I am saying is that just as we supported the increase in VAT what we need to do is to free up resources for other infrastructure and development. And subsidy on electricity is one of the things that is taking the money which we don\u2019t even have. What I am advocating is conditional in terms of ensuring that these DisCos and GenCos and transmission company are run with the best corporate performance standard and run very efficiently. I am not actually advocating that Nigerians should subsidise the inefficiency of these companies.\n\n\u201cMy suggestion is for the citizens of this country to resist the companies whether through civil disobedience or litigation or media advocacy to ensure that they are run efficiently.\n\nFor his part former Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Indsuty, Mr Muda Yusuf, argues that the Nigerian power sector situation is a complicated one. \u201cGenerating the liquidity to feed the power supply chain remains a major challenge\u201d. It is all the more worrisome because we have seen significant adjustments in tariffs over the last two years. There is a large measure of discontent over the moves towards a cost effective tariff. Therefore, the push towards a full cost reflective tariff should be gradual to minimise the shocks on citizens and corporates. This has become even more necessary because of the frequency of tariff reviews that had taken place over the last one to two years.\u201d\n\nHe however noted that the challenge of collection and commercial losses appear intractable. The DisCos seem helpless in tackling this menace. The problem of estimated billing still persists generating serious ill feeling towards the DISCOs. The metering programme is not as fast as promised.\n\nThe transition to full cost recovery has to be a gradual thing. There are significant social and economic considerations to be reckoned with. In a statement to Daily Sun the LCCI noted that was still too early to offer a prognosis. However, what matters most is the availability of electricity to power our homes, industries, and offices. Comparably, the cost of providing diesel for industries is likely higher than the electricity supply from the national grid.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

I believe that if you carry out your responsibility very well, the public would be the most beneficiary of it all.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like and which I have always said I will never be a party to is where award is given based on sentiments or given based on political affiliations.\u201d\n\nOn his recognition as Man of the Year, Wike said: \u201cWhen I got the letter, I did say that if you have thought it necessary that we merit it, then, we have no choice but to accept it. I will dedicate this award to God Almighty and entire people of the state.

But here in our state you can see the reaction of the people, telling you how happy they are with your actions and activities.\n\n\u201cFor me, governance is not only based on the infrastructure. There are certain laws that are in place that will enhance governance in the state.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address, the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief, The Sun Publishing Limited, Onuoha Ukeh, explained that Wike\u2019s selection for The Sun Man of the Year award was the outcome of a rigorous a rigorous process.\n\nOutlining what influenced the decision to name Wike Man of the Year 2020, he said the has contributed immensely to the socio-economic and political development of the country.\n\nHe said Wike recent intervention on Value Added Tax (VAT) has opened Nigerians\u2019 eyes to the practice of true and fiscal federalism.\n\nHe said right from the time Wike assumed office as governor, he had worked in a way to show that wants to make Rivers State a place to live in.\n\n\u201cBy your performance, you have graduated from being \u2018Mr. Project,\u2019 which Vice President Yemi Osinbajo named you to a \u2018Miracle Worker,\u2019 as you have delivered the \u2018dividends of democracy\u2019 to your people even at difficult times.\n\n\u201cLast year, when COVID-19 became a pandemic, you taught the world how to keep people safe from it.

          "text": "*Says \u2018one north\u2019 assumption delusional\n\n*Advises region to put purported numerical strength to productive use\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe issue of rotational presidency sparked yet another debate yesterday following a boast at the weekend by Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, that the North could retain the country\u2019s presidency, irrespective of the South, if the region\u2019s numerical strength was factored in.\n\nBut the Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) dismissed the NEF spokesman\u2019s claim as both reckless and careless.\n\nSaMBA, in a statement by its spokesman, Rwang Pam Jnr, said the statement purportedly made on behalf of NEF, lacked basis. It wondered how NEF could resort to such lowly submission.\n\nBaba-Ahmed had on Saturday said the North was in the process of rebuilding itself and was not prepared to play second fiddle in a nation, where it enjoyed numerical strength. He stated this in a keynote address at the maiden edition of the Maitama Sule Lecture Series organised by the students\u2019 wing of the Coalition of Northern Groups at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.\n\nBaba-Ahmed stated, \u201cWe will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before, whether we are president or vice president, we will lead Nigeria. We have the majority of the votes and democracy says vote whom you want. Why should we accept a second-class position when we know we can buy a form and contest for first class and we will win?\n\n\u201cWhy does anybody need to threaten us and intimidate us? We will get that power, but be humble, because power comes from God. We inherited leadership and being honest is not being stupid. The North has pride; we are humble enough to know that we are going to run Nigeria with other people, but we are not going to play a second fiddle to anybody.\n\n\u201cWe may not have the most robust economy, there are people, who are trying to strangulate us even more than we are being strangled. We are ready for this. We will consider every economic adversity, challenge. We will fix the northern economy and we are the only ones who can fix this northern economy. For that reason, we are not for sale. We are in the process of rebuilding the North and we will rebuild the North from 2023.\n\n\u201cWhether the North holds power in 2023 or not, anybody who wants to break up in this country will say so, they are just looking for excuses. This is democracy. If they don\u2019t like what Nigeria is, they will say they want to break up from this country, we don\u2019t pay attention to those people, we are focused on the fact that we are running a democratic system.\u201d\n\nHowever, responding, SaMBA said in astatement, \u201cLet Dr Baba-Ahmed be reminded that without the Middle Belt, such numbers boasted about in the North are mere political posturing.

Nigeria is presently rated as the poverty headquarters of the world, because of poor standards of living in the region under the present leadership.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge liberal minded northerners to work with the Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) to produce a new crop of leaders in 2023 with the requisite competence, character and courage to usher Nigeria into the 21st century.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Gen Christopher Musa, said the military was working within the ambit of international laws and maintained that the law would take its cause.\n\nHe further noted that the military was doing all within international laws in the handling of Boko Haram and the prosecution of surrendered terrorists against the backdrop of the recent mass surrender of the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe are just doing what we are supposed to do. The laws will naturally take its course, nobody will take them in and tomorrow say \u2018go, your sins are forgiven\u2019.\n\n\u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t work that way, and that is why we were able to talk to the Governor (Borno) and advise him to call for a stakeholders\u2019 meeting which was held to chart a way forward,\u201d Musa said.\n\nSpeaking earlier during a media tour of troops in the frontlines, units and formations in the theatre of Operation Hadin Kai, Sector I and II in the region, Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, said the objective of the visit was to review the wrong narratives about the surrendered Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists.\n\nHe noted that operations conducted against the terrorists had resulted in depleting its ranks.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is very important to stop their desperate recruitment bid,\u201d he said.\n\nNwachukwu said the efforts of the military should be highlighted by the media for Nigerians to appreciate the efforts of the troops particularly, in the fight against insurgency and terrorism in the North-east.\n\nHe said the media tour was aimed at discussing the issues of rehabilitation of surrendered terrorists and plight of the victims of the conflict.\n\n\u201cThese fundamental reasons gave birth to the media tour of the North-east. The Boko Haram insurgents have been surrendering. People have questioned the authenticity of the surrendering of these insurgents. People are also questioning why the insurgents are surrendering at this point in time.\n\n\u201cThe fight against insurgency has recorded tremendous success considering what it was in the past. At some point, few years back, as far back as 2014, Boko Haram was almost advancing towards Lokoja, they were marching towards Abuja. Today, they have been boxed to the Timbuktu or the hills,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Govt rakes in N1.1trn\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nSignificant growth in non-oil tax receipts in April, prompted by the gradual return of business activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, led to a 28.2 per cent increase in the federal government\u2019s revenue, relative to the preceding month, raising the government\u2019s revenue to N1.106 trillion, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed.\n\nThe CBN stated this in its monthly economic report for April posted on its website.\n\nAccording to the report, at N1.106 trillion, the federation receipt in April 2021 outpaced both the budget benchmark and collections in March 2021 by 28.2 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively.\n\nWhile oil revenue accounted for 35.5 per cent (or N392.91 billion) of total receipts in the period, non-oil revenue contributed 64.5 per cent (or N712.87 billion).\n\nThe report attributed the diminished share of oil to the meagre remittance of N3.79 billion from crude oil and gas exports, compared with N52.50 billion in the 2021 budget estimate.\n\nThis reflected the exacerbating incidence of cost \u2018under-recovery,\u2019 as reported by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), it stated.\n\nThe report said, \u201cIn addition, the significant decline in domestic crude oil and gas sales, also contributed to the meagre oil receipt during the period. The strong performance of non-oil revenue in April 2021 reflected the maturing benefits of the Strategic Revenue Generation Initiative (SRGI) of the federal government, as contained in the 2019 and 2020 Finance Acts.\n\n\u201cThe contribution of non-oil revenue was driven, majorly, by higher earnings from Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and Value Added Tax (VAT).\u201d\n\nHowever, the report disclosed that the federal government\u2019s total outstanding contractual liabilities increased to N28.98 trillion at the end March 2021, indicating an increase of 15.8 per cent relative to March 2020 and 2.5 per cent compared to December 2020.\n\nThis was as debt service obligations amounted to N1.03 trillion as at first quarter of 2021 compared with N779.73 billion and N461.98 billion in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively.\n\nThe increase in the federal government\u2019s liability was propelled by the fiscal policy drive to support economic recovery, reduce infrastructural deficit and fund COVID-19 mitigation programmes.\n\nThe CBN stated that the significant rise in debt service was due, largely, to the interest payments on additional FGN bonds, promissory notes and the redemption of the $500 million Eurobonds, which matured in January 2021.\n\nThe retained revenue of the federal government stood at N409.31 billion or 38.5 per cent below target.\n\nSimilarly, the provisional aggregate expenditure of the federal government stood at N559.67 billion, or 50.6 per cent below the budget benchmark and 59.4 per cent short of the level in March.\n\nConsequently, the fiscal operations of the FGN in April 2021 contracted by 67.8 per cent, relative to the budget estimate.\n\nThe CBN, however, stated that output growth trajectory remained largely positive, looking ahead, following optimism of an accelerated COVID-19 vaccination and expected favourable crude oil prices.\n\nIt stated, \u201cGrowth will continue to be supported by the implementation of the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) and the accommodative monetary stance of the Bank.\n\n\u201cThe moderation in food supply shocks, associated with the improved harvests, as rainy season kicks in, will continue to have favourable knock-on effects on inflationary pressures and moderate headline index, going forward.\u201d\n\nThe CBN predicted that the external sector outlook remained stable and would be supported by the on-going policy on diaspora remittances.\n\nIt added, however, that despite the confidence, downside risks to the outlook persist.\n\nThe apex bank stated, \u201cConcerns over the emerging third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and Asia could depress global supply chain and crude oil demand.\n\n\u201cIn addition, external vulnerability, insecurity across the country, subsisting infrastructure gap, and constrained fiscal space, may weigh negatively on the growth prospects.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The law also prohibits the act of moving cattle round public places by herders.\n\nThe signing of the anti-open grazing law by the Governor followed the decision of Southern Governors\u2019 Forum last August, setting the September deadline to pass the law across member States.\n\nThere have been crises witnessed in some States, resulting from alleged open grazing.\n\nAlthough farmer-herder crisis is not pronounced in Lagos, the anti-open grazing law is expected to prevent the spillover of the menace into the State.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who assented to the bill during the State\u2019s Executive Council meeting in Alausa, directed the security agencies to swing immediately into action and enforce provisions of the law.\n\nHe said: \u201cBy the powers vested in me as the Governor of Lagos State, I am signing the bill on Open Cattle Grazing and Trespass of Cattle on Land into law to prohibit issues associated with open grazing of livestock.\u201d\n\nThe Governor also signed legislation transforming the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT) into a full-blown agency.\n\nThe development coincided with the commemorative month dedicated to raising awareness on gender-based violence in the State. The Governor and members of the State\u2019s cabinet wore attire with purple shades to support the campaign against sexual violence.\n\nThe DSVRT legislation provides for the establishment of Sexual Offenders\u2019 Register that would help the State efficiently tackle violations in the communities.\n\nAfter signing the law, Sanwo-Olu said: \u201cRaising awareness about domestic and sexual violence is an important piece of working to end the cycle of violence. It is important to reiterate the State Government\u2019s zero tolerance to all forms of sexual and gender-based violence. We will not rest on our oars until the menace is reduced to the barest minimum in Lagos.\u201d\n\nThe Governor appointed Mrs. Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi as the Executive Secretary of the new agency.\n\nVivour-Adeniyi was the coordinator of the response team before the legislation was signed into law.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The images show gory footage of KIA and items taken by the terrorists. Please viewer\u2019s discretion is advised. (Please find attached pictures).\n\n\u201cInformation Ops by terrorists has redoubled by ISWAP. Any misleading effort is being taken by the terrorist group to maintain status quo within the helms of propaganda used to encourage youths of the factions course. ISWAP elements need to pay dearly for this.\n\n\u201cIt is believed that the terrorists are planning more ambush Ops using command IED lanes/small gun attacks on MSR Maiduguri-Monguno.\n\n\u201cIt is advised that AI/fire missions are conducted by JTF OpHK to neutralise terrorist positions which are suggested to be based at Kukawa Primary School and Gudumbali in Kukawa and Guzamala local government areas respectively.\n\n\u201cIt is important that troops of Sector 3 initiate robust clearance and fighting patrols dominate the MSR to dismantle ISWAP attack approaches.\n\n\u201cTroops should be urged to be cautious of IED lanes whenever moving. Period movements should be aided by AC OpHK CAS or surveillance miniature drones to D\u00b3 terrorist elements.\u201d\n\nThe warning trails last week's attack on military personnel in Borno.\n\nOn Thursday, a yet-to-be-confirmed number of soldiers were killed and several others missing after an ambush by militants from the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jam\u0101'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jih\u0101d in Borno State.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the attack took place in Monguno on Thursday.\n\nBUSTED: @HQNigerianArmy Secretly Contacts Families As Boko Haram Fighters Kill 25 Soldiers In Borno | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/gTrJWlXLch pic.twitter.com/716u31zcF2 \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) September 21, 2021\n\nMonguno is over 100km north of Maiduguri, the state capital and hosts thousands of Internally Displaced Persons, mostly from Dikwa and Marte council areas.\n\n\u201cWe lost so many soldiers during the attack that lasted for many hours.

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) says the country\u2019s first digital currency, eNaira, must be accepted as a form of payment by all merchants and business outlets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, the apex bank said it would launch the pilot scheme of eNaira by October 1, 2021, with Bitt Inc., a Barbados-based fintech firm, as its technical partner.\n\nSpeaking when he featured on Business Morning, a Channels Television programme, on Monday, Musa Jimoh, CBN\u2019s director of payment system management, said eNaira is a legal tender just as the naira.\n\n\u201cToday, anywhere you present naira to pay, compulsorily it must be accepted because that is our fiat currency,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, the same way naira is accepted that you can\u2019t reject it, is the same way e-naira must be accepted. Anywhere in this country where e-naira is presented, it must be accepted. So, merchants must accept e-naira as a means of payment.\u201d\n\nHe said that similar to the fiat currency (naira), the CBN bears all liabilities for the eNaira.\n\nJimoh advised Nigerians to open eNaira wallets, which could be downloaded on mobile phones from October 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe liability of the e-naira money is directly on CBN, which is similar to the cash you hold. The liability of the cash you hold today rests with the CBN. So, it gives Nigerians the opportunity to bank with CBN,\u201d he added.\n\nOn whether Nigeria was ready for the e-naira due to the technological challenges in the country, he said that he didn\u2019t expect it to be a serious problem.\n\n\u201ceNaira is a journey. We don\u2019t expect that on October 1, all business merchants in Nigeria will accept it. We don\u2019t even expect that come October 1, all Nigerians will have e-naira. It is a journey.

          "text": "In June 2016, Ventures Platform launched as an innovation hub where tech enthusiasts, freelancers, startup founders, and professionals in Nigeria could meet, network, and co-create. The 1,200-square-meter hub in Abuja also served as a residential base for technology entrepreneurs on the continent selected to go through the VP accelerator programme.\n\nOver the past five years, Ventures Platform has changed its investment strategy from the accelerator model to become one of the leading early-stage funds in Africa while it spun off the innovation hub business, now managed by its subsidiary Ventures Park.\n\nWith the recent surge in fundraising, tech activity, and uptake of remote freelance jobs in Nigeria, Ventures Park has seen its community of active users nearly double from just over 100 in early 2021 to almost 200. In response to the increase, the company has launched a bigger campus, in Abuja, to provide greater support to its community.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria has the highest number of startups in Africa, according to findings by fDi Intelligence of Financial Times, in collaboration with Briter Bridges. As of August, a report by Disrupt Africa showed that Nigerian startups accounted for the biggest share of the $1.1 billion funding the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem had attracted this year.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, yet remote work shows no signs of going away. The social distancing rules, public gathering restrictions, and other lockdown measures that were imposed to curb the spread of the virus forced companies across the world to adopt remote work options to keep their businesses running.\n\nThat reality has also played out in Nigeria. While most people in the country still work from physical offices amid the health crisis, a few companies, such as Andela, Paystack, and Buycoins, have fully embraced the work-from-home idea.\n\nBut there are significant barriers to the success or long-term adoption of remote work; such as Nigeria\u2019s inefficient power grid and irregular electricity supply as well as poor network connectivity and high internet costs. Nigeria ranks among countries with the most expensive data in the world.\n\nThe new Ventures Park campus in Abuja. Image credit: Supplied.\n\nA shared workspace at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja. Image credit: Supplied\n\nInnovation hubs and co-working spaces like the new Ventures Platform campus in Abuja are equipped with power and internet amenities that help freelancers work and entrepreneurs build better.\n\nThe new 2,000-sq-meter hub is located in Wuse II, Abuja, and has the capacity to accommodate over 200 people. It has facilities such as private and shared offices, dedicated desks, restaurants, and spaces designed to host events, conferences, fun activities, and more.\n\nOn the walls of the new campus are displays of several contemporary Nigerian art, which help create a stimulating and stress-free work environment. \u201cAt Ventures Park, we believe fundamentally that the space people work in influences the kind of work they produce,\u201d Kola Aina, founder of Ventures Platform told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThe Chill Zone. Image credit: Supplied.\n\nThe Chill Zone. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nIn addition to technology enthusiasts and stakeholders, the campus is open to non-governmental organisations, international agencies such as the United Nations, as well as researchers and professors working in northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our users are in the startup ecosystem but we have a good mix of people that come, work, and interact with one another,\u201d Ventures Park CEO, Nkechi Oguchi said. According to Aina, the \u2018multidisciplinary\u2019 nature of the community is \u201creally important to creating a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Garden of V-Den.

Oguchi explains that the company believes that talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn\u2019t evenly distributed.\n\n\u201cIf everyone continued to focus on Lagos, we\u2019d miss out on talents in other parts of Nigeria,\u201d she said. \u201cWe chose Abuja to cater to the community and build the ecosystem here and since we launched, we\u2019ve seen real progress in tech activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aina, Ventures Platform, since its launch, has been deliberate about wanting to provide opportunities in Abuja and the broader northern region of the country. \u201cMany years later, the ecosystem in Abuja and northern Nigeria has grown significantly and we\u2019re proud to have been part of that process.\u201d\n\nVentures Park offers different free and paid membership plans for people looking to make use of the campus, including low-cost options from as low as N1,500 ($2.7).\n\n\u201cWe understand how important it is for people to work with budgets,\u201d Oguchi said. \u201cCompanies can book a space for a two or three-hour meeting and we also have several membership plans for individuals and startups.\u201d\n\nThe training room at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja.

          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Inside story of electronic bank fraud in Nigeria",
          "text": "More than six high-profile electronic bank fraud cases took place in Nigeria between February and July this year. Among these was the failed attempt on an account of a Federal Government parastatal domiciled with one of the first-generation banks in which well over N1 billion was transferred to various accounts across different banks in the country.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d some repentant bank hackers, told BusinessDay, \u201cbecause the transfers were done over the NEFT platform and it takes 24 hours to clear on that platform. So, it was detected before the money could clear.\u201d\n\nBarewa, Ele, and Ereke (not real names) are repentant bank hackers. It took months to cultivate their trust. \u201cWe used to be in the business,\u201d Ereke told BusinessDay, after getting assurances of anonymity.\n\nThe digital revolution in banking has resulted in an equivalent revolution in e-banking frauds. PwC in a recent report on Payments in Emerging Markets notes that to meet the need for financial inclusion, there has been a rapid expansion of new technologies and innovations, which are helping to make it more economically viable for banks to reach the \u2018unbanked\u2019 or \u2018underbanked\u2019 populations. Technology has leapfrogged from branch banking to e-banking and now mobile money, which has helped to create pockets of strength even among the less financially inclusive countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, usage of mobile-based payment systems has increased due to wide access to mobile phones as a payment form, both on the customer usage side and acceptance (merchant) side.\n\nA 2020 McKinsey & Co report observed that \u201ca youthful population, increasing smartphone penetration, and a focused regulatory drive to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments, are combining to create the perfect recipe for a thriving fintech sector.\u201d\n\nBut these variables have not just been drivers of financial inclusion alone. The Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) warned that \u201cthe increase in transaction processing, speed and available channels comes with an unavoidable side effect \u2013 more vectors for fraudulent activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NIBSS, fraud-related transactions reportedly cost Nigerian banks on average N14 billion in losses annually. These figures, some within the banking sector, believe are understated.\n\nThe Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) in 2018 sought to investigate some banks for the inadequate rendition of returns to the Corporation on instances of fraud, forgeries, and cases involving members of their staff who were either dismissed or had their appointments terminated on grounds of fraudulent activities. The NDIC made the decision in the light of the report from its Off-Site Supervision of the banks, which revealed the number of fraud cases attributed to internal abuse by staff of banks increased from 231 in 2016, to 320 in 2017, or 38.53 percent above the figure reported for the previous year.\n\nToday, e-banking frauds have developed into a mega industry where cyber criminals deploy sophisticated tools to steal information and scam account holders. The list of bank frauds perpetrated online is endless.\n\nElectronic bank fraud\n\nIn September 2020, the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation arrested four Nigerian nationals in Muntinlupa City of the country for alleged involvement in an international syndicate that hacks and siphons funds from banks.\n\nAccording to the NBI, the fraudsters\u2019 transactions were traced when they hacked a system of one Philippine bank, where at least P100 million ($2m) were transferred into a different account.\n\nIn early 2016, a criminal gang penetrated the security systems of Bangladesh Bank with malware that cloned legitimate transactions. On February 4, the malware sent 35 withdrawal requests through the international SWIFT system to the New York Federal Reserve, where the Bangladeshi central bank had money on deposit. The fraudsters attempted to steal a total of $951 million. Thirty of the orders, worth $850 million, were blocked by the New York Fed, but the gang succeeded in having $101 million transferred to banks in Sri Lanka and the Philippines before their activities were noticed, thanks to a spelling mistake in one of the transfer requests. Subsequently, $20 million was recovered from a Sri Lankan bank, but officials were too late to stop the remaining $81 million from disappearing.\n\nIn January this year, the Police in Edo State arrested six suspected bank hackers who stole N5 million from a victim\u2019s account. One of the suspects, Adesola Kayode, was said to have confessed to the police: \u201cWe buy stolen SIM cards from armed robbers and thieves. We normally assess the ones that have money in their bank accounts and remove the money.\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, the police in Kano State arrested eight men and two women for belonging to a syndicate that specialises in hacking individuals\u2019 bank accounts to withdraw money.\n\nAlmost a year earlier, a Lagos High Court convicted Abbas Mohammed and a Bureau De Change operator, Ibrahim Saidu Jogal, who connived to hack into the flexible database of Union Bank of N2,550,000,000 (two billion, five hundred and fifty million naira).\n\nIn February, Obiwanne Okeke, who once appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine, was jailed for 10 years in the US over a cyber fraud scam that led to the theft of about $11 million. Obinwanne Okeke, also known as Invictus Obi, used Nigerian-based companies to defraud people in the US. His companies used phishing emails to steal funds from victims.\n\nIn one phishing attack in 2018 he managed to gain access to the email of a manager at Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar\u2019s heavy industrial and farm equipment. They made fraudulent wire transfers to the value of nearly $11 million, and moved the funds overseas.\n\nElectronic or e-banking in Nigeria has become so expansive that it is hard to believe that it was only in the 2000s that this reality began to gain prominence within the country\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHow frauds are committed, those behind them and their methodologies\n\nTargeting the business account of a large corporate or public sector organisation requires fraudsters to always recruit an insider from within the target organisation. In the case of the Federal Government parastatal targeted in April this year, such an insider was able to aid the hacking of the accounting platform of the parastatal by accessing the log-in details of as many as six approving officials.\n\nA device known as a \u2018Grabber\u2019 will be connected to the key-board of an approving officer\u2019s computer. The work of the grabber is to collect and send all actions on the keyboard to the fraudsters wherever they may be\u201d. The major objective of the fraudsters at this point is to get the password of the approving officers.\n\nWith the fraudsters\u2019 computer system connected to the parastatal\u2019s server, they now had a system that served as the link between the server and themselves. At this point, they could now comfortably operate from within or outside the country.\n\nThis is made possible by installing a software like TeamViewer which makes it further possible to connect multiple computers to one server once the master hard disc (computer connected to host server) is connected to the server of the targeted bank. TeamViewer is a remote access and remote control computer software that connects computers, smartphones, servers, IoT devices including robots, with fast, high performance connections through a global access network. It was first released in 2005, and its functionality has expanded step by step. It is proprietary software, but does not require registration and is free of charge for non-commercial use. It has been installed on more than two billion devices.\n\nI ask if they are aware of the recent hacking of a first-generation bank in early August. They all mention the name of the bank in unison. \u201cWord spreads around,\u201d they tell me. \u201cIt is impossible to undertake such a big project without word spreading in the community. People have to be recruited, accounts have to be opened and money has to be evacuated. You can\u2019t do that alone,\u201d one of them says.\n\nAccording to the Police Special Fraud Unit, after hacking the Flex-Cube Universal Banking System (FCUBS) of the bank, Salau Abdulmalik Femi created fictitious credits totalling One Billion, Eight Hundred Thousand Naira (N1,868,900,000.00) on the accounts of three of the bank\u2019s customers and successfully consummated debits (outflows) amounting to Four Hundred and Seventeen Million, Five Hundred and Forty-Two Thousand Naira (N417,542,000.00) through Internet Banking transfers to other banks.\n\nOver N1.8 billion was transferred out of different accounts domiciled with the bank using the most secure anti-fraud device known as TOKEN, as the gateway. What they did was to reconfigure existing TOKENS of other customers of the bank and refresh it to match a targeted account in the bank that has good money. Account providers then provided accounts which were credited with amounts ranging from twenty million naira (N20m) to five hundred million naira (N500m) depending on the volume the accounts can carry without raising a red flag.\n\nRead Also: How to protect yourself from rising e-banking fraud\n\nHow are these huge amounts evacuated and laundered through the system?\n\nThis is where the Bureaux De Change comes in. BDCs are the major platforms for laundering fraud-based monies. There is a long incestuous relationship between the BDCs and bank fraudsters, a relationship an official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission tells me is well known to the regulators, the police and the anti-graft agencies.\n\nIn late July, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, banned the sale of foreign exchange to BDC operators. The ban, Emefiele said, was necessary because the parallel market had become a conduit for illicit forex flows and graft.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that BDCs have allowed themselves to be used for graft,\u201d he had said. \u201cThis measure is not punitive on anyone, but it is to ensure the CBN is able to carry out its legitimate mandate of serving all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nBDCs are indispensable partners with the fraudsters in major bank fraud operations. The BDCs do not originate any fraud operation, but they serve as the most credible and most practicable instruments for evacuating and laundering the billions of naira hacked out of the banks\u201d.\n\nThe methodology is simple. The BDCs provide accounts to which the fraudsters who have attacked a bank pay let\u2019s say five hundred million naira into. The BDCs will then use the money to purchase dollars from the CBN from which they would pay the fraudsters an agreed percentage of the total amount credited to their accounts. Percentages range from 40 to 50 percent for the fraudster. So, if the BDC buys one million dollars from the CBN with the N500 million given to them by a fraudster, they will give the fraudster between four hundred and five hundred thousand dollars and keep between five hundred and six hundred thousand dollars for themselves as their cut.\n\nWhy do the BDCs get such huge amounts when they are not involved in the initiation and operationalisation of the frauds? It is because the BDCs take the biggest risk. \u201cThey have to be paid well\u201d, I am told, \u201cbecause the BDCs will need lots of money to follow up the case in the event of arrest and investigations. It is not easy to find and arrest the brains behind the fraud. It is easier to trace the flow of money to the BDCs. The BDCs provide the final evacuation accounts for the big money and this can easily be traced to them by the Police or EFCC and when investigations start, the monies would easily be traced to them. With big risk comes big money\u201d.\n\nBut why do BDCs take such big risks? \u201cGreed!\u201d Ereke asserts. \u201cGreed and because they can get away with it\u201d.\n\nHe asks me if I have ever heard of a BDC owner jailed for abetting bank fraud.\n\nI cannot recollect any. He tells me that no BDC owner has ever been jailed for aiding fraudsters after the fact. \u201cSome owners and managers are arrested of course; they settle with the Police or EFCC and are released. Any BDC person jailed is just a low-level employee that has been put forward for just that purpose\u201d.\n\nWho is the Insider?\n\nWhat is the role of Insiders in e-banking frauds? Absolutely no bank fraud of any nature can happen without the collaboration of someone from the inside; a staff of the bank or staff of the organisation whose business account is being targeted. Though the insider in almost all cases is not the originator of the bank fraud, he or they (most times the fraudster will have multiple insiders on a single fraud transaction) playing a significant role in the operation.\n\nThe insider, they tell me, is responsible for plugging the keylogger to the system (for the hardware) or installing it on the system in the case of the software type. A keylogger is a small hardware device not bigger than the smallest flash drive. It is used to record keyboard actions, like keystrokes on a key-board, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored and recorded. Some keyloggers also come as soft wares.\n\nDeveloped in the then Soviet Union in the 1970s, the Keylogger was first used by KGB (Soviet Intelligence Service) counterintelligence officers who installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow. They installed the bugs in Selectric II and Selectric III electric typewriters. It measured the movements of the print head of IBM Selectric typewriters. By doing this, they were able to determine the exact information American diplomats were sending back to their headquarters at the State Department in Washington.\n\nIt is almost impossible for fraudsters to hack into a bank\u2019s system from the outside, because all the banks operate on an intranet system. So, there is always the need for an insider who can smuggle a computer system into the bank and connect it to the server. Such a system must have been configured to provide intranet connectivity of the bank to the fraudsters anywhere they are in the world.\n\nIn addition, an insider is critical to the fraudsters in their understanding of the detailed process required to carry out fraudulent operations on a customer\u2019s bank account. This will include but not limited to initiation and authorisation process, withdrawal limits on specific accounts, confirmation system and approval patterns, among others.\n\nFurthermore, they enable the fraudsters to be very much cognisant of everything happening within the bank after the fraud has taken place. The post-fraud information they provide makes it difficult for the bank to arrest an account holder in the process of trying to make withdrawals because once the banks find out about the fraud, all account holders will be informed by the insider to stay clear for the meantime.\n\nThere is no specific profile of an insider based on tribe, region or religion, but a very distinctive characteristic of such an individual is someone who has gained the trust of his co-workers. They will be careless around him because of his hard work, cheerfulness and willingness to help.\n\nThe typical Insider is almost always a Male. Very few women tend to be willing to take big risks to serve as Insiders.\n\nIn searching for an insider, fraudsters tend to look out for bankers that are sociable and who tend to live above their income. A banker with a drug addiction is a very sure bet for recruitment as an insider. The insiders are cultivated by the fraudsters who expose them to a very lavish lifestyle. \u201cThey fly them on first class air tickets, lodge them in five-star hotels, ply them with some of the most expensive whiskey and wines, and in fact there are cases where senior insiders are flown on weekends to Dubai for operational meetings,\u201d they tell me.\n\nAn insider can be any staff of a bank, depending on the role he or she is expected to play. An insider can be a senior bank staff, junior staff, a bank cleaner or the security seated at the door.\n\n\u201cCertainly, you won\u2019t need a Head of Operations in a bank for the purpose of plugging a keylogger\u201d, Ele informs me. These classes of insiders are mostly casual staff of the bank who most times are aggrieved with their employer for a number of reasons such as low salaries, lack of motivation, bogus target, job insecurity and the ego factors such as having the requisite qualifications as their colleagues who are core staff with better enumeration. Even a cleaner can be recruited for key log plugging.\n\nAn insider that helps provide connectivity for remote access most likely would have a good knowledge of IT, this is so because IT information will be needed in setting up remote access; information such as URL, domain name and general information. Such a person is expected to be able to multitask. Among other things he or she is expected to identify accounts that will be attacked and debited for the fraud.\n\nAccount openers and account peddlers\n\nThese are people whose only role in the fraud cycle is the provision of accounts that will not be traceable to them in the event of fraud. What they do is recruit financially handicapped people in the society and open various bank accounts for them and then collect the ATM cards from them. Their targets are shoe shiners, truck pushers, bike riders (Okada) who have never had any dealings with a bank. The \u2018account peddler\u2019 tends to sell them a glossy but false story about the Federal Government distributing money to the poor through the banks. For these financially excluded persons to be able to access these monies, they are told they first need to open a bank account.\n\nBecause of voter awareness in the northern part of Nigeria most of this group of people have the INEC voter\u2019s card which is one of the means of identification needed to open a savings account. The \u2018peddler\u2019 now provides them with the other requirements needed, such as utility bills, phone number (which the peddler already has), email address and N10,000 (amount needed to open a bank account).\n\nWhen the account is opened and the bank ATM given to the account opener, the \u2018peddler\u2019 collects the ATM from the account owner on the pretext of taking it to the government agency for registration. A day or two later he calls the account holder, and informs him that the money has been paid into the account, gives him N10,000 and tells him that particular account cannot collect the grant twice. So now armed with his BVN from the first account, the \u2018peddler\u2019 will now take the account opener round commercial banks in town, opening accounts and paying N5000 to N10,000 for each account.\n\nAt the end of the day, a single person could provide between 10-12 ATM cards for the peddler. An active Peddler can recruit up to 10 persons in a month, and by doing so he will have control of over 100 accounts that are not traceable to him. In the event of a bank hacking fraud operation, he is able to provide these accounts to the fraudsters.

So, all the \u2018chairman\u2019 needs, is to access the pool, where he will get all the \u2018specialists\u2019 needed. Each \u2018specialist\u2019 in the team for a specific bank fraud has a specific role to play. Nobody is called upon to participate unless there is a role he or she has to play.

          "text": "More than six high-profile electronic bank fraud cases took place in Nigeria between February and July this year. Among these was the failed attempt on an account of a Federal Government parastatal domiciled with one of the first-generation banks in which well over N1 billion was transferred to various accounts across different banks in the country.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d some repentant bank hackers, told BusinessDay, \u201cbecause the transfers were done over the NEFT platform and it takes 24 hours to clear on that platform. So, it was detected before the money could clear.\u201d\n\nBarewa, Ele, and Ereke (not real names) are repentant bank hackers. It took months to cultivate their trust. \u201cWe used to be in the business,\u201d Ereke told BusinessDay, after getting assurances of anonymity.\n\nThe digital revolution in banking has resulted in an equivalent revolution in e-banking frauds. PwC in a recent report on Payments in Emerging Markets notes that to meet the need for financial inclusion, there has been a rapid expansion of new technologies and innovations, which are helping to make it more economically viable for banks to reach the \u2018unbanked\u2019 or \u2018underbanked\u2019 populations. Technology has leapfrogged from branch banking to e-banking and now mobile money, which has helped to create pockets of strength even among the less financially inclusive countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, usage of mobile-based payment systems has increased due to wide access to mobile phones as a payment form, both on the customer usage side and acceptance (merchant) side.\n\nA 2020 McKinsey & Co report observed that \u201ca youthful population, increasing smartphone penetration, and a focused regulatory drive to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments, are combining to create the perfect recipe for a thriving fintech sector.\u201d\n\nBut these variables have not just been drivers of financial inclusion alone. The Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) warned that \u201cthe increase in transaction processing, speed and available channels comes with an unavoidable side effect \u2013 more vectors for fraudulent activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NIBSS, fraud-related transactions reportedly cost Nigerian banks on average N14 billion in losses annually. These figures, some within the banking sector, believe are understated.\n\nThe Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) in 2018 sought to investigate some banks for the inadequate rendition of returns to the Corporation on instances of fraud, forgeries, and cases involving members of their staff who were either dismissed or had their appointments terminated on grounds of fraudulent activities. The NDIC made the decision in the light of the report from its Off-Site Supervision of the banks, which revealed the number of fraud cases attributed to internal abuse by staff of banks increased from 231 in 2016, to 320 in 2017, or 38.53 percent above the figure reported for the previous year.\n\nToday, e-banking frauds have developed into a mega industry where cyber criminals deploy sophisticated tools to steal information and scam account holders. The list of bank frauds perpetrated online is endless.\n\nElectronic bank fraud\n\nIn September 2020, the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation arrested four Nigerian nationals in Muntinlupa City of the country for alleged involvement in an international syndicate that hacks and siphons funds from banks.\n\nAccording to the NBI, the fraudsters\u2019 transactions were traced when they hacked a system of one Philippine bank, where at least P100 million ($2m) were transferred into a different account.\n\nIn early 2016, a criminal gang penetrated the security systems of Bangladesh Bank with malware that cloned legitimate transactions. On February 4, the malware sent 35 withdrawal requests through the international SWIFT system to the New York Federal Reserve, where the Bangladeshi central bank had money on deposit. The fraudsters attempted to steal a total of $951 million. Thirty of the orders, worth $850 million, were blocked by the New York Fed, but the gang succeeded in having $101 million transferred to banks in Sri Lanka and the Philippines before their activities were noticed, thanks to a spelling mistake in one of the transfer requests. Subsequently, $20 million was recovered from a Sri Lankan bank, but officials were too late to stop the remaining $81 million from disappearing.\n\nIn January this year, the Police in Edo State arrested six suspected bank hackers who stole N5 million from a victim\u2019s account. One of the suspects, Adesola Kayode, was said to have confessed to the police: \u201cWe buy stolen SIM cards from armed robbers and thieves. We normally assess the ones that have money in their bank accounts and remove the money.\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, the police in Kano State arrested eight men and two women for belonging to a syndicate that specialises in hacking individuals\u2019 bank accounts to withdraw money.\n\nAlmost a year earlier, a Lagos High Court convicted Abbas Mohammed and a Bureau De Change operator, Ibrahim Saidu Jogal, who connived to hack into the flexible database of Union Bank of N2,550,000,000 (two billion, five hundred and fifty million naira).\n\nIn February, Obiwanne Okeke, who once appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine, was jailed for 10 years in the US over a cyber fraud scam that led to the theft of about $11 million. Obinwanne Okeke, also known as Invictus Obi, used Nigerian-based companies to defraud people in the US. His companies used phishing emails to steal funds from victims.\n\nIn one phishing attack in 2018 he managed to gain access to the email of a manager at Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar\u2019s heavy industrial and farm equipment. They made fraudulent wire transfers to the value of nearly $11 million, and moved the funds overseas.\n\nElectronic or e-banking in Nigeria has become so expansive that it is hard to believe that it was only in the 2000s that this reality began to gain prominence within the country\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHow frauds are committed, those behind them and their methodologies\n\nTargeting the business account of a large corporate or public sector organisation requires fraudsters to always recruit an insider from within the target organisation. In the case of the Federal Government parastatal targeted in April this year, such an insider was able to aid the hacking of the accounting platform of the parastatal by accessing the log-in details of as many as six approving officials.\n\nA device known as a \u2018Grabber\u2019 will be connected to the key-board of an approving officer\u2019s computer. The work of the grabber is to collect and send all actions on the keyboard to the fraudsters wherever they may be\u201d. The major objective of the fraudsters at this point is to get the password of the approving officers.\n\nWith the fraudsters\u2019 computer system connected to the parastatal\u2019s server, they now had a system that served as the link between the server and themselves. At this point, they could now comfortably operate from within or outside the country.\n\nThis is made possible by installing a software like TeamViewer which makes it further possible to connect multiple computers to one server once the master hard disc (computer connected to host server) is connected to the server of the targeted bank. TeamViewer is a remote access and remote control computer software that connects computers, smartphones, servers, IoT devices including robots, with fast, high performance connections through a global access network. It was first released in 2005, and its functionality has expanded step by step. It is proprietary software, but does not require registration and is free of charge for non-commercial use. It has been installed on more than two billion devices.\n\nI ask if they are aware of the recent hacking of a first-generation bank in early August. They all mention the name of the bank in unison. \u201cWord spreads around,\u201d they tell me. \u201cIt is impossible to undertake such a big project without word spreading in the community. People have to be recruited, accounts have to be opened and money has to be evacuated. You can\u2019t do that alone,\u201d one of them says.\n\nAccording to the Police Special Fraud Unit, after hacking the Flex-Cube Universal Banking System (FCUBS) of the bank, Salau Abdulmalik Femi created fictitious credits totalling One Billion, Eight Hundred Thousand Naira (N1,868,900,000.00) on the accounts of three of the bank\u2019s customers and successfully consummated debits (outflows) amounting to Four Hundred and Seventeen Million, Five Hundred and Forty-Two Thousand Naira (N417,542,000.00) through Internet Banking transfers to other banks.\n\nOver N1.8 billion was transferred out of different accounts domiciled with the bank using the most secure anti-fraud device known as TOKEN, as the gateway. What they did was to reconfigure existing TOKENS of other customers of the bank and refresh it to match a targeted account in the bank that has good money. Account providers then provided accounts which were credited with amounts ranging from twenty million naira (N20m) to five hundred million naira (N500m) depending on the volume the accounts can carry without raising a red flag.\n\nRead Also: How to protect yourself from rising e-banking fraud\n\nHow are these huge amounts evacuated and laundered through the system?\n\nThis is where the Bureaux De Change comes in. BDCs are the major platforms for laundering fraud-based monies. There is a long incestuous relationship between the BDCs and bank fraudsters, a relationship an official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission tells me is well known to the regulators, the police and the anti-graft agencies.\n\nIn late July, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, banned the sale of foreign exchange to BDC operators. The ban, Emefiele said, was necessary because the parallel market had become a conduit for illicit forex flows and graft.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that BDCs have allowed themselves to be used for graft,\u201d he had said. \u201cThis measure is not punitive on anyone, but it is to ensure the CBN is able to carry out its legitimate mandate of serving all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nBDCs are indispensable partners with the fraudsters in major bank fraud operations. The BDCs do not originate any fraud operation, but they serve as the most credible and most practicable instruments for evacuating and laundering the billions of naira hacked out of the banks\u201d.\n\nThe methodology is simple. The BDCs provide accounts to which the fraudsters who have attacked a bank pay let\u2019s say five hundred million naira into. The BDCs will then use the money to purchase dollars from the CBN from which they would pay the fraudsters an agreed percentage of the total amount credited to their accounts. Percentages range from 40 to 50 percent for the fraudster. So, if the BDC buys one million dollars from the CBN with the N500 million given to them by a fraudster, they will give the fraudster between four hundred and five hundred thousand dollars and keep between five hundred and six hundred thousand dollars for themselves as their cut.\n\nWhy do the BDCs get such huge amounts when they are not involved in the initiation and operationalisation of the frauds? It is because the BDCs take the biggest risk. \u201cThey have to be paid well\u201d, I am told, \u201cbecause the BDCs will need lots of money to follow up the case in the event of arrest and investigations. It is not easy to find and arrest the brains behind the fraud. It is easier to trace the flow of money to the BDCs. The BDCs provide the final evacuation accounts for the big money and this can easily be traced to them by the Police or EFCC and when investigations start, the monies would easily be traced to them. With big risk comes big money\u201d.\n\nBut why do BDCs take such big risks? \u201cGreed!\u201d Ereke asserts. \u201cGreed and because they can get away with it\u201d.\n\nHe asks me if I have ever heard of a BDC owner jailed for abetting bank fraud.\n\nI cannot recollect any. He tells me that no BDC owner has ever been jailed for aiding fraudsters after the fact. \u201cSome owners and managers are arrested of course; they settle with the Police or EFCC and are released. Any BDC person jailed is just a low-level employee that has been put forward for just that purpose\u201d.\n\nWho is the Insider?\n\nWhat is the role of Insiders in e-banking frauds? Absolutely no bank fraud of any nature can happen without the collaboration of someone from the inside; a staff of the bank or staff of the organisation whose business account is being targeted. Though the insider in almost all cases is not the originator of the bank fraud, he or they (most times the fraudster will have multiple insiders on a single fraud transaction) playing a significant role in the operation.\n\nThe insider, they tell me, is responsible for plugging the keylogger to the system (for the hardware) or installing it on the system in the case of the software type. A keylogger is a small hardware device not bigger than the smallest flash drive. It is used to record keyboard actions, like keystrokes on a key-board, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored and recorded. Some keyloggers also come as soft wares.\n\nDeveloped in the then Soviet Union in the 1970s, the Keylogger was first used by KGB (Soviet Intelligence Service) counterintelligence officers who installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow. They installed the bugs in Selectric II and Selectric III electric typewriters. It measured the movements of the print head of IBM Selectric typewriters. By doing this, they were able to determine the exact information American diplomats were sending back to their headquarters at the State Department in Washington.\n\nIt is almost impossible for fraudsters to hack into a bank\u2019s system from the outside, because all the banks operate on an intranet system. So, there is always the need for an insider who can smuggle a computer system into the bank and connect it to the server. Such a system must have been configured to provide intranet connectivity of the bank to the fraudsters anywhere they are in the world.\n\nIn addition, an insider is critical to the fraudsters in their understanding of the detailed process required to carry out fraudulent operations on a customer\u2019s bank account. This will include but not limited to initiation and authorisation process, withdrawal limits on specific accounts, confirmation system and approval patterns, among others.\n\nFurthermore, they enable the fraudsters to be very much cognisant of everything happening within the bank after the fraud has taken place. The post-fraud information they provide makes it difficult for the bank to arrest an account holder in the process of trying to make withdrawals because once the banks find out about the fraud, all account holders will be informed by the insider to stay clear for the meantime.\n\nThere is no specific profile of an insider based on tribe, region or religion, but a very distinctive characteristic of such an individual is someone who has gained the trust of his co-workers. They will be careless around him because of his hard work, cheerfulness and willingness to help.\n\nThe typical Insider is almost always a Male. Very few women tend to be willing to take big risks to serve as Insiders.\n\nIn searching for an insider, fraudsters tend to look out for bankers that are sociable and who tend to live above their income. A banker with a drug addiction is a very sure bet for recruitment as an insider. The insiders are cultivated by the fraudsters who expose them to a very lavish lifestyle. \u201cThey fly them on first class air tickets, lodge them in five-star hotels, ply them with some of the most expensive whiskey and wines, and in fact there are cases where senior insiders are flown on weekends to Dubai for operational meetings,\u201d they tell me.\n\nAn insider can be any staff of a bank, depending on the role he or she is expected to play. An insider can be a senior bank staff, junior staff, a bank cleaner or the security seated at the door.\n\n\u201cCertainly, you won\u2019t need a Head of Operations in a bank for the purpose of plugging a keylogger\u201d, Ele informs me. These classes of insiders are mostly casual staff of the bank who most times are aggrieved with their employer for a number of reasons such as low salaries, lack of motivation, bogus target, job insecurity and the ego factors such as having the requisite qualifications as their colleagues who are core staff with better enumeration. Even a cleaner can be recruited for key log plugging.\n\nAn insider that helps provide connectivity for remote access most likely would have a good knowledge of IT, this is so because IT information will be needed in setting up remote access; information such as URL, domain name and general information. Such a person is expected to be able to multitask. Among other things he or she is expected to identify accounts that will be attacked and debited for the fraud.\n\nAccount openers and account peddlers\n\nThese are people whose only role in the fraud cycle is the provision of accounts that will not be traceable to them in the event of fraud. What they do is recruit financially handicapped people in the society and open various bank accounts for them and then collect the ATM cards from them. Their targets are shoe shiners, truck pushers, bike riders (Okada) who have never had any dealings with a bank. The \u2018account peddler\u2019 tends to sell them a glossy but false story about the Federal Government distributing money to the poor through the banks. For these financially excluded persons to be able to access these monies, they are told they first need to open a bank account.\n\nBecause of voter awareness in the northern part of Nigeria most of this group of people have the INEC voter\u2019s card which is one of the means of identification needed to open a savings account. The \u2018peddler\u2019 now provides them with the other requirements needed, such as utility bills, phone number (which the peddler already has), email address and N10,000 (amount needed to open a bank account).\n\nWhen the account is opened and the bank ATM given to the account opener, the \u2018peddler\u2019 collects the ATM from the account owner on the pretext of taking it to the government agency for registration. A day or two later he calls the account holder, and informs him that the money has been paid into the account, gives him N10,000 and tells him that particular account cannot collect the grant twice. So now armed with his BVN from the first account, the \u2018peddler\u2019 will now take the account opener round commercial banks in town, opening accounts and paying N5000 to N10,000 for each account.\n\nAt the end of the day, a single person could provide between 10-12 ATM cards for the peddler. An active Peddler can recruit up to 10 persons in a month, and by doing so he will have control of over 100 accounts that are not traceable to him. In the event of a bank hacking fraud operation, he is able to provide these accounts to the fraudsters. If the fraudster credits each of these cards with N5 million each, the total will amount to over N500 million. He will then be given a percentage of the amount withdrawn from these accounts.\n\nThese funds tend to be withdrawn at different sources such as big departmental stores with the aid of staff such as the Manager or Supervisor of the store at an agreed percentage. He uses the ATM on their POS and collects cash. Petrol filling stations, electronics and car marts also serve as withdrawal points.\n\nOperational team\n\nThere is no specific number of persons required to undertake an electronic bank fraud. The \u2018Chairman\u2019 (initiator and supervisor of a particular fraud) alone determines exactly what he needs for the operation. So, he recruits people based on the input he requires and the operational strategy he has put in place. I am told there is a pool of bank fraudsters of over ten thousand people scattered across the country. So, all the \u2018chairman\u2019 needs, is to access the pool, where he will get all the \u2018specialists\u2019 needed. Each \u2018specialist\u2019 in the team for a specific bank fraud has a specific role to play. Nobody is called upon to participate unless there is a role he or she has to play. These include roles like an Insider to plug the keylogger, an Insider that can provide remote access, account peddlers that will be used for the evacuation of proceeds of the fraud and if need be, a sponsor of the operation.\n\nD-Day\n\nAlmost all bank frauds tend to take place during weekends and public holidays. The reason for this is to allow ample time for the monies hived out of the bank to be squirrelled away. \u201cIt is mostly on Fridays that these operations take place. Public holidays that begin on Thursdays are the most welcome period for bank fraud. This is because there will be sufficient time to carry out the operation, move the funds to twenty to fifty different accounts, and then the weekends and public holiday periods will allow them to withdraw the money through ATMs, POS, supermarket purchases and transfers to BDCs\u201d.\n\nA crime without end\n\nAndy Greenberg in Wired, aptly noted that \u201cthe traditional model of robbing a bank isn\u2019t so different from the old-fashioned method of robbing one. Thieves get in, get the goods, and get out\u201d. In 2016, Nigeria\u2019s central bank warned, \u201cthat this digital journey is plagued with land mines represented by electronic fraud would be stating the obvious, as the world over has shifted security policy stances to a more cybercentric position.

          "text": "Bunmi lives in Maitama, a swanky district of Nigeria\u2019s capital city, Abuja. She runs a medium-sized fashion design and fabric procurement outfit from her home from where she dresses a small but well-heeled posse of customers, and supplies draperies and textiles to clients.\n\nShe sighs as she remembers the day, she said changed her life. \u201cIt was on Saturday, July 11th last year,\u201d she said.\n\nWith a corporate account in one of the fastest growing banks in the country, she had become worried after customers, including an international NGO based in the city had paid ninety-three million naira into her corporate account over a two-day period for the supply of fabrics. \u201cI became nervous,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen I neither received alerts nor emails on my phone alerting me to these deposits. It was very unusual. I actually thought it was a network problem. In fact, I hadn\u2019t been bothered initially; it was after a few hours that I began to get agitated. I needed to pay my suppliers in Lagos that Saturday\u201d.\n\nRead Also: How to protect yourself from rising e-banking fraud\n\nBunmi called her friend who works in the bank that evening, and it was then she found out that her alerting system had been compromised.

          "text": "Chief Executive Officers (CEO) of eleven commercial banks out of the 13 listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited as well as those of two unlisted banks earned N1.7 billion between them in executive pay for 2020.\n\nThe average total compensation for the heads of the banks came to N144 million, one one per cent less than the N1.74 billion earnings for 2019, Premium Times reported.\n\nNigerian banks generally did well amid COVID-19 in 2020, recording profits above the 2019 level in a year that witnessed lockdowns and an economic decline.\n\nThe increase in revenue and profit did not stop banks from cutting jobs and pay, however. While some lenders added new jobs, others retrenched despite a directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria for banks to keep their staff.\n\nFigures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the total number of staff in commercial banks fell by 9.03 per cent to 95,026 from 103, 610 in 2019. Not all who left the sector were dismissed. Some resigned and others retired.\n\nThe bulk of those who lost their jobs were contract staff. The number of contract workers dropped from 45,350 in 2019 to 39,798 while the total number of junior staff declined from 39, 896 to 37,590.\n\nInterestingly, the commercial banks increased their sizes of their executive staff from 184 to 257, a 39.67 per cent rise, that pushed total personnel cost by 3.37 per cent to N552 billion.\n\nCEOs pay\n\nZenith\u2019s Ebenezer Onyeagwu took a pay rise of more than four per cent bringing his remuneration to N230 million, while his FBN Holdings counterpart, U.K Eke, received N122 million, about 2 per cent higher than his earnings for 2019.\n\nOn the contrary, Innocent C. Ike of Polaris took N65 million, N19 million lower than his 2019 pay, just as Union Bank Managing Director Emeka Emuwa received almost 5 per cent less. Both CEOs opted for a pay cut even when their banks posted increases in profit. The emoluments of the rest 8 CEOs were unchanged.\n\nGTB\u2019s Segun Agbaje maintained the top spot, his N400 million earnings almost two times those of his closest rival. Oluwatomi Somefun of Unity Bank earned the least pay, according to Premium Times report.\n\nThe analysis below show the pay spread on a table and infographic.\n\nDirectors\u2019 Pay\n\nGenerally, the emoluments of bank directors in Nigeria were little impacted by the 2020 global economic crisis, given a modest increase in their pay and entitlements for the year, relative to those of 2019.\n\nOnly one (FirstBank) of the Big 5 banks, commonly called FUGAZ, reported an increase in directors\u2019 remuneration; the rest four recorded a drop. In some ways, it reflects the efficiency of frugality as a winning factor in the time of austerity. Even when some lenders had grounds like bigger revenues and profits to up the pay of directors, they chose to lower them and took the longer view by laying up more earnings for future operations.\n\nFidelity, Polaris and Sterling all upped the emoluments of board members (excluding CEOs) despite reporting a slide in revenue, with Fidelity increasing its by as much as 78 per cent. Wema retained the remuneration of its top rank at the same level as 2019.\n\nCutting its directors pay by almost one third, Zenith Bank adopted the most prudent approach in compensating its directors out of the 14 banks monitored by Premium Times.",

          "title": "JUST-IN: 20% Of Nigeria\u2019s Workforce Lost Employment In 2020 \u2013 Report",
          "text": "A new report released this Tuesday by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Nigeria and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has shown that 20 per cent of the fulltime workforce in Nigeria lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe report, which assessed the impact of COVID-19 on business enterprises in Nigeria, is based on in-depth interviews with almost 3,000 businesses from both the formal and informal sectors across major industries of the economy, UNDP and NBS said in a joint statement today.\n\n80 per cent of enterprises reported experienced a decrease in production with a majority reporting a decline in production between 21 percent to 60 percent.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a decline in production of goods and services and an increase in operational costs, 55 per cent of business enterprises were utilising less than 60 percent of their capacity.\n\nThe organisations said \u201cto counter the impact of containment measures on operations, 77 per cent of business enterprises reported that they either reduced working hours, or either temporarily or permanently had to lay off workers.\u201d\n\nThe findings also reveal a level of uncertainty plaguing enterprises around the country with 61 per cent of enterprises expressing low confidence in relation to outlook on the future, where their perception of their capacity to operate uninterrupted, under the current circumstances, was less than one year.\n\nA small minority of businesses however reported positive gains during the pandemic with 19 per cent of enterprises reporting increase in revenue with higher proportions of enterprises in the utilities, financial and insurance and human and health services sectors registered revenue gains over the course of the pandemic, compared to the year before.\n\nMirroring broader global movement towards e-commerce and direct distribution to consumers to reduce health risks and overcome hurdles imposed by pandemic restrictions, 15 percent of the enterprises expanded either products and services offered or their sales and distribution channels\n\nWhile there have been promising signs of recovery this year, COVID-19 has had an outsized socio-economic impact on Nigeria. From disruptions in supply chains, to ongoing supply and demand shocks and a drop in consumer confidence, these challenges are expected to leave lasting impact on the businesses and enterprises that make up the backbone of the economy.\n\nThe report, \u2018The Impact of COVID-19 on Business Enterprises in Nigeria,\u2019 also highlights the significant decline in revenue faced by enterprises and establishments across the country as a result of the pandemic.\n\n81 per cent of enterprises interviewed experienced a decline in revenue and 73 per cent stated that they faced liquidity challenges due to secondary impacts of COVID-19 in 2020. The median loss in revenue reported remained at 44 percent, in comparison to 2019 revenues.\n\nClose to 60 per cent of enterprises surveyed experienced an increase in operational costs with the price of raw materials and logistics being the top two contributors to this increase. Other operational challenges included access to credit and capital, high expenditure on utilities and the lack of an adequate social safety net, especially for informal enterprises.\n\nIn addition, the report shows that one in three business enterprises surveyed indicated that they know of businesses that have permanently closed due to operational challenges resulting from the pandemic.\n\nStatistician-general of the federation, Dr Simon Harry highlighted the importance of the survey results saying that \u201cas the economy begins to show signs of gradual growth, this report contains important information that can guide policy makers in their interventions to mitigate the negative socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 in the country. I wish to thank UNDP for collaborating with National Bureau of Statistics on this important report and I urge other development partners to emulate this worthy endeavour by partnering with the Bureau in matters relating to data generation in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the report findings highlight the complex challenges the economy continues to face because of COVID-19, it also tells a powerful story of innovation, resilience and strength as Nigerian businesses leverage their ingenuity to adjust to this new normal\u201d said UNDP Resident Representative Mr. Mohamed Yahya.\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria mobilises to recover from the devastating health and socio-economic impact of the pandemic, this report will be a critical tool in informing targeted policymaking and programme interventions for both medium and long-term planning as the country rebuilds.\u201d\n\nData from the report suggests that businesses are likely to continue experiencing the impact of the pandemic even after the easing of public health measures. Despite reduced restrictions at the time of the interviews, 74 percent of enterprises still reported a decrease in production levels when compared to the same time in 2019.",

          "text": "The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has expressed disappointment over the exclusion of Rivers State from states that are to benefit from the projects to be executed with the fresh loan that the Federal Government is seeking to obtain from the World Bank.\n\nThis is as he observed that Nigeria must encourage federating states to harness their resources and generate revenues, including Value Added Tax (VAT) to advance their development.\n\nHe described as a sheer act of discrimination the Federal Government\u2019s exclusion of Rivers State as one of the states that would benefit from projects for which it is seeking fresh foreign loans to execute.\n\nThe governor made the observation when the Managing Director of Sun Publishing Limited, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh, led a delegation to present a letter of nomination to him in Port Harcourt on Monday.\n\nHe said; \u201cLook at the money that Federal Government has gone to borrow from the World Bank. Of all the projects, in all the states, Federal Government did not include Rivers State.\n\n\u201cLook at the list of projects that states will benefit from this money they\u2019re borrowing from the World Bank, that they have sent to National Assembly for approval, the only states that are not benefitting is Rivers State.\n\n\u201cIt is the prerogative of Mr. President; if he says he does not like Rivers State, if the ruling party says they don\u2019t like Rivers State, I won\u2019t kill myself. But leave the one that the law says I should be the one to collect so that I will be able to develop my own state,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe governor observed that there are mounted attempts to frustrate federating states like Rivers, to actualise the constitutional provisions that empower them to harness their resources and revenues, particularly VAT.\n\nHe decried the situation where the legality of states collecting VAT is not considered on the merit of the law by some public commentators including state executives, rather, they are politicising it and looking at it from the prism of ethnicity and religion.\n\nAccording to Governor Wike, what the FIRS was doing was illegal and could be likened to robbing from the states.\n\nHe said; \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to be a lawyer to know that VAT is not in items 58 and 59 of the second schedule of the 1999 Constitution as amended. Everybody knows that. It is not even in the concurrent list. Therefore, it falls under the residual list. It is not arguable. That yesterday nothing happens does not mean that today nothing will happen, or tomorrow something will not happen.\n\n\u201cNigeria should encourage states to be strong enough to have resources to develop their states. We are in a federal system where we are practicing a unitary system. Everybody at the end of the month will run to Abuja to share money. Nobody comes back to the state to think, how do I develop my state?\u201d",

Even as a Governor of Imo State, I didn\u2019t draw a penny for the years I spent. I hate public funds. One thing about public funds is that, if you don\u2019t work for it, don\u2019t collect it because it has spiritual implications\u201d, Okorocha told the Journalists.\n\nSpeaking further on the basic salaries and allowances of Senators, Okorocha said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much a Senator earns. But I think the basic salary is around N2m, but allowance is around N3m for housing, then transportation and other allowances put together to be around N10m or N11m, not too sure\u201d.\n\nOkorocha who has been clamouring for the reduction in the cost of governance by reducing the number of Senators to one for each State and three House of Representatives Members from each state, however, said the take home of the Senators was not that much, compared to their status and the cost of living.\n\n\u201cBut truly speaking, can the N3m for housing allowance pay for the rent of a Senator? Except if you want them to go and live in Maraba and Nyanya.\n\n\u201cI have advocated that we reduce the numbers of Senators and Reps Members, but they said NO. So, if we must have these numbers of lawmakers in Nigeria, then we should be able to carter for their welfare also\u201d, he added.\n\nOkorocha, who talked on a wide range of subjects related to governance, unity, and development in Nigeria, also stated that the judiciary must be strengthened in order to drive citizens and leaders to be patriotic, since this is where the Nigerian state\u2019s grandeur rests.\n\nThe NUJ presented Senator Okorocha with the icon of humanitarian award in recognition of his services to the emancipation of Nigerian children through his foundation.",

A simple internet search would have availed Mr. Whoriskey of the judgment of the case and the present state of affairs. Further, questions 2-5 were directly extracted from untested allegations contained in a first amended verified complaint filed before the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division\u201d the groups alleged.\n\nThey called on media houses not to yield their platforms to people whose objectives were not noble as such would encourage unhealthy business rivalry. \u201cThere is a plethora of questions which The Washington Post rather has to answer and which directly calls to question its genuineness in permitting this to happen. It will be damning to the long-held image of The Washington Post that its staff have yielded the platform of the medium to the use for a global smear campaign and unhealthy business rivalry\u201d Mr. Tochukwu Ohazuruike who addressed the press was quoted as saying.\n\nIn answering the allegations against Mr. Peters, the groups claimed that \u201cMr. Peters has stated severally that he has never received any favour by way of facilitation or otherwise from Dieziani Alison-Madueke, and there was therefore nothing to be grateful for. He has severally denounced any such attempt to link the purchase of his property with Dieziani under such premises. His purchase of the furniture was in furtherance of his desire to furnish a property that belonged to him, and those furniture can be found, even today, at his said property at 58 Harley House. No furniture that belonged to him can be found at any other place other than in his property. The furniture found at the UK address of Dieziani Alison-Madueke does not belong to him, and certainly could not have been the same found in his said property at 58 Harley House.\u201d\n\nThey insist that the answers they provided should discourage future smear campaigns as this is not the first time it was happening saying \u201cwe hope that with these answers we would have satisfied Mr. Whoriskey and got him to alert his sponsors that the plot is dead on arrival and cannot be revived. We also say to all such persons who would in the future want to regurgitate these issues that the answers are already available in the public space as there is nothing hidden and there is nothing any media house can unearth again so no need taking any jobs from the sponsors of this smear campaign.\u201d",

All the security agencies will be working on it so that when those people eventually appear in court, there will be a prima facie case against them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t first call people before the court and start looking for evidence against them later. No! The cases will be tied up before they appear in court,\u201d Adesina stated.\n\nHis remarks come four months after the Federal Government said it had begun profiling for prosecution, well-placed Nigerians suspected to be financiers of terrorism in the country.\n\nOn May 7, the AGF and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, revealed that investigations conducted established reasonable evidence of the involvement of some highly placed individuals, businessmen, and institutions across Nigeria in financing insurgency in the North East.",

          "text": "The issue of rotational presidency sparked yet another debate on Monday following a boast at the weekend by Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, that the North could retain the country\u2019s presidency, irrespective of the South, if the region\u2019s numerical strength was factored in.\n\nBut the Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) dismissed the NEF spokesman\u2019s claim as both reckless and careless.\n\nSaMBA, in a statement by its spokesman, Rwang Pam Jnr, said the statement purportedly made on behalf of NEF, lacked basis. It wondered how NEF could resort to such lowly submission.\n\nBaba-Ahmed had on Saturday said the North was in the process of rebuilding itself and was not prepared to play second fiddle in a nation, where it enjoyed numerical strength. He stated this in a keynote address at the maiden edition of the Maitama Sule Lecture Series organised by the students\u2019 wing of the Coalition of Northern Groups at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.\n\nBaba-Ahmed stated, \u201cWe will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before, whether we are president or vice president, we will lead Nigeria. We have the majority of the votes and democracy says vote whom you want. Why should we accept a second-class position when we know we can buy a form and contest for first class and we will win?\n\n\u201cWhy does anybody need to threaten us and intimidate us? We will get that power, but be humble, because power comes from God. We inherited leadership and being honest is not being stupid. The North has pride; we are humble enough to know that we are going to run Nigeria with other people, but we are not going to play a second fiddle to anybody.\n\n\u201cWe may not have the most robust economy, there are people, who are trying to strangulate us even more than we are being strangled. We are ready for this. We will consider every economic adversity, challenge. We will fix the northern economy and we are the only ones who can fix this northern economy. For that reason, we are not for sale. We are in the process of rebuilding the North and we will rebuild the North from 2023.\n\n\u201cWhether the North holds power in 2023 or not, anybody who wants to break up in this country will say so, they are just looking for excuses. This is democracy. If they don\u2019t like what Nigeria is, they will say they want to break up from this country, we don\u2019t pay attention to those people, we are focused on the fact that we are running a democratic system.\u201d\n\nHowever, responding, SaMBA said in astatement, \u201cLet Dr Baba-Ahmed be reminded that without the Middle Belt, such numbers boasted about in the North are mere political posturing. It is disheartening that Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed will make such reckless and careless statement at a time, when we are still battling to keep the country united.\n\n\u201cOne would have expected that the retired Permanent Secretary with his exposure and academic prowess, will choose his words carefully, but it is quite unfortunate that NEF will talk recklessly.\n\n\u201cIt is certain that some liberal minded people in the North will be shedding secret tears as a result of the statement credited to the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), because it is based on a delusion of a \u2018one north\u2019 that has treated the Middle Belt region as second class citizens.\n\n\u201cThe so-called \u2018north\u2019 cannot boast of numerical strength to win election without reckoning with the strength of the Middle Belt and other northern Christians that have decided to work with their southern Nigeria counterparts to produce fresh and effective leaders for the country.\n\n\u201cRather than boasting of numerical strength to win election, NEF should look for ways to turn the numerical strength to productivity. Nigeria is presently rated as the poverty headquarters of the world, because of poor standards of living in the region under the present leadership.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge liberal minded northerners to work with the Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) to produce a new crop of leaders in 2023 with the requisite competence, character and courage to usher Nigeria into the 21st century.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "text": "Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said the state aims to vaccinate 30 per cent of its population within one year.\n\nAccording to a statement, the governor said this at the 2021 Global Citizen Live Concert held at Fela\u2019s Afrika Shrine at Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nAudiences in 11 cities across the world, including Paris, Seoul, London, Sidney, New York and Los Angeles, witnessed the live event held in honour of frontline and essential workers in the battle against the global pandemic.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is a 24-hour global event initiated in six continents to unite the world in defending the planet against diseases and defeating poverty. A-list Nigerian musical artistes that performed live during the international concert included Femi Kuti, Davido, Tiwa Savage and Made Kuti, among others.\n\nSpeaking further, the governor pointed out that access to COVID-19 vaccines was one of the strategies designed by the United Nations (UN) to kick start global recovery, especially in cities that are signatories to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework.\n\nThe governor gave detailed explanation about how the state government had expanded access to vaccines since the vaccination programme began in March and the state\u2019s projection to protect its residents and environment.\n\nAs the epicentre of the pandemic outbreak, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos had pursued a radical vaccination programmes, which led to the administration of 16,000 jabs of vaccines daily.\n\nThis, the governor said was a far cry from what was projected in achieving herd immunity.\n\nHe disclosed that 405,000 residents had received first doses of AstraZeneca, while 289,000 persons returned for their second doses.\n\nThe state, he said, administered 230,000 first shots of Moderna to raise the vaccinated population to about 1.2 per cent within five months.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur vaccination rate is far below the minimum target of 60 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) per city population. At the current rate, it would take about three years to achieve our herd immunity target. We cannot continue at this speed if we seriously want to beat this virus.\n\n\u201cTo safely achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of our population would need to be vaccinated to lower the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population.\n\n\u201cOne of the objectives of attaining herd immunity is to prevent mutations from emerging leading to more aggressive strains. It is important that Lagos achieves herd immunity at the same time with all countries together.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu noted the situation of unequal distribution of vaccines in which richer nations secured more doses than the size of their populations and are preparing to roll out booster shots, while poorer countries struggled to administer first doses, threatening the global efforts to end the pandemic.\n\nHe said vaccine equity remained the only path to toe by world leaders to end the pandemic.\n\nTo do this, the Governor said the world must ensure that vaccines were available to all, especially poorer countries that had struggled with supply.\n\nOn how Lagos was creating access and ramping up vaccination, Sanwo-Olu said the government was leveraging the private sector funding, capacity and infrastructure to scale up availability and distribution.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur proposal to the private sector is to reserve and administer 50 per cent of the vaccines procured in partnership with the private sector to be made available free of charge at Government health centres. We propose to deploy a proven system where those who can pay for vaccines subsidise the cost of vaccination for those who cannot.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that we expect COVID-19 vaccinations to be annual going forward, this is the only sustainable path towards achieving herd immunity and making Lagos free of the virus. \u201cWith our approach, we expect to vaccinate 30 per cent of the population of Lagos within one year. This will put us on a better and more sustainable path towards herd immunity. We expect COVID-19 vaccinations to be an annual programme, going forward, as this is the only way to making Lagos free of the virus.\u201d\n\nEditor",
