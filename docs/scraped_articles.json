          "title": "#TwitterBan: We are monitoring closely repression in Nigeria, says Commonwealth",
          "text": "The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Rt Hon Patricia Scotland QC has stated that the Commonwealth is \u201cclosely monitoring developments around suspension of Twitter, and allegations of repression of the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, media freedom, as well as disregard for the rule of law in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMs Scotland said: \u201cAll Commonwealth member countries, including Nigeria, have obligations and commitments to uphold freedom of expression as one of the core values and principles of the Commonwealth Charter. This underscores a commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights covenants and international instruments.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the Commonwealth followed an Urgent Appeal by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) urging Ms Scotland to \u201capply the Commonwealth Charter to hold the Nigerian government to account over the unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and the resulting repression of freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom.\u201d\n\nThis development was disclosed today by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nIn the Urgent Appeal, SERAP had stated that: \u201cThe Nigerian government has repeatedly demonstrated that it is not committed to protecting human rights. The Commonwealth should take a clear stand to ensure accountability of institutions, freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nResponding, Ms Scotland in a letter sent to SERAP, said: \u201cI write to acknowledge with thanks, receipt of your letter dated 5 June 2021 highlighting concerns about the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe letter by the Commonwealth dated 22 July 2021, and signed on behalf of Ms Scotland by Roger Koranteng, Officer in Charge, Governance and Peace Directorate, read in part: \u201cThe Commonwealth Secretary-General has been following the developments in Nigeria very closely and she is engaging the relevant stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease be assured that the Secretariat will remain engaged with the authorities in Nigeria and encourage a speedy resolution of this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Commonwealth member countries [including Nigeria] have committed themselves to upholding freedom of expression as one of the core values and principles of the Commonwealth Charter, which underscores a commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights covenants and international instruments.\u201d\n\nKolawole Oluwadare said: \u201cWe are very delighted that our letter and the concerns that it raises have caught the attention of the Commonwealth Secretary-General. Given her public record for justice and human rights, we have absolutely no doubt that she will prevail on the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to lift the unlawful suspension of Twitter, respect human rights, and obey the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it should never have reached this level, as the government has absolutely no justification to suspend Twitter in Nigeria. The Buhari administration ought to have complied with the Commonwealth Charter and other similar human rights standards as a matter of routine.\u201d\n\nSERAP\u2019s Urgent Appeal dated 5 June, 2021, read in part: \u201cMs Scotland should urgently consider recommending the suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth to the Heads of Government, the Commonwealth Chair-in-office, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, as Head of the Commonwealth to push the government to take concrete measures to respect and promote the Commonwealth\u2019s values of human rights, transparency, accountability and the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians can only freely participate in the democratic processes and shape the society in which they live if these fundamental human rights are fully and effectively respected, protected and promoted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension has the character of collective punishment and is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution and the country\u2019s international obligations. Nigerian authorities would seem to be suppressing people\u2019s access to Twitter to exploit the shutdown to cover up allegations of corruption, abuses, and restrict freedom of expression and other fundamental rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government has also called for the prosecution of those who violate its order suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria. This order for prosecution of Twitter users violates the legal rule that there should be no punishment without law.\u201d\n\n\u201cRespect for Commonwealth values is essential for citizens to trust Commonwealth institutions. The Commonwealth ought to take a strong stand for protection of human rights, transparency and the rule of law in Nigeria, principles which are fundamental to the Commonwealth\u2019s integrity, functioning and effectiveness of its institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter in Nigeria demonstrates the authorities\u2019 determination to suppress all forms of peaceful dissent by the Nigerian people. There are well-founded fears that the human rights situation in Nigeria will deteriorate even further if urgent action is not taken to address it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, the Nigerian government on Friday 4 June, 2021 unlawfully ordered all internet service providers to suspend Twitter in Nigeria. The suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria followed the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets, which according to Twitter \u2018violated the Twitter Rules.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter in Nigeria is taking place against the background of repression of the civic space and harassment of media houses, and journalists who are targeted simply for performing their professional duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter has seriously undermined transparency and accountability in government. The lack of transparency undermines the rule of law and Nigerians\u2019 ability to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cLack of transparency and accountability, and the absence of the rule of law in Nigeria have contributed hugely to denying Nigerians their fundamental human rights. People have been targeted simply for using Twitter and peacefully exercising their fundamental human rights.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Just yesterday, in a statement by the Police service commission, It noted that \u201cA US Court cannot order the arrest of a Non-Citizen resident in Nigeria.\u2019 The statement further revealed that only the PSC has prerogative power to either suspend, demote or dismiss an erring officer.\u201d\n\nThe Arewa Youths and the former Minister of Aviation, FFK, among others have also thrown their weights behind the embattled Cop, stating that he is innocent and shouldn\u2019t be extradited.\n\n4-man special investigation panel begins probe\n\nA 4 man panel has been set up by the IGP to investigate the FBI\u2019s indictment of DCP Abba Kyari. The panel is expected to do a thorough review of documents sent to the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI.\n\n\u201cThe Special Investigation Panel (SIP), comprising four (4) Senior Police Officers, is headed by DIG Joseph Egbunike, the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID).\n\n\u201cThe SIP, inter alia, is to undertake a detailed review of all the allegations against DCP Abba Kyari by the US Government as contained in relevant documents that have been availed the NPF by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\n\u201cThe SIP is also to obtain a detailed representation of DCP Abba Kyari to all the allegations levelled against him, conduct further investigations as it deems fit, and submit recommendations to guide further actions by the Force Leadership on the matter,\u201d The letter stated.\n\nThe IGP has, however, reaffirmed the commitment of the Force to the Rule of Law and assured the public of the sanctity of the probe as well as the absolute respect for the rights and privileges of the officer throughout the period of the investigations.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "* FINDINGS: Ansaru winning N/West locals with al Qaeda model\n\n*How ISIS aided terrorists\u2019 growth\n\n* Present threat is from ISWAP\n\n* Insurgents may remain immune to counter-terrorism in Lake Chad basin\n\n*Factional splits have led to more violence\n\n* RECOMMENDATION: Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon should synchronise efforts\n\nBy Charles Kumolu, Deputy Editor\n\nAmid what seems like an onslaught against law enforcement agents in Nigeria, it has emerged that no fewer than 1,868 members of security forces may have been killed in the North-East by Boko Haram between 2018 and 2020.\n\nAlso, the three years were said to be the deadliest for security agents on the frontline of the fight against terrorists.\n\nThe figure for the three years is said to be almost equal to the total number of people killed by the terrorist group in six years, 2011-2017.\n\nThese were contained in a report titled: Violent Extremism in Sub-Saharan Africa: Lessons from the Rise of Boko Haram, published by UK-based Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.\n\nTony Blair is a former British Prime Minister.\n\nThe report, dated July 23, 2021, is part of the institute\u2019s Africa Frontiers Series.\n\nAuthored by Audu Bulama Bukarti, it, among other issues, extensively investigated the origin of Boko Haram, its founders, funding, internal battles, strengths, sustaining factors and capacity to carry out attacks.\n\nMany misconceptions about the group were addressed just as likely solutions were proffered.\n\nIt drew from Hausa, Kanuri and Arabic-language evidence and eyewitness accounts, including the author\u2019s extensive interviews with former classmates and associates of three of the four founders \u2013 Muhammed Yusuf, Muhammed Ali and Mamman Nur.\n\nThe report also warned that for Nigeria\u2019s counter-terrorism campaign against Boko Haram to be successful, the sincerity of those prosecuting the battle on the frontlines is essential.\n\nIn addition, it warned that in the North-West, Ansaru is winning the hearts and minds of locals by using the al-Qaeda model.\n\nNorth-West has, of late, been a hotbed of bandits who have been kidnapping people, including schoolchildren, for ransom.\n\nFactional splits\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cfactional splits led to more, not less, violence with Boko Haram\u2019s ideology retained despite the divisions. Boko Haram\u2019s splintering into the Ansaru faction in 2012 and then ISWAP in 2016 (the original faction JAS also remains present) did not diminish the terror threat \u2013 but enhanced it. All three splinter factions share operational and ideological histories, with networks built over many years. This divergence has only served to create additional modus operandi and growth strategies beyond the initial plans outlined by Muhammed Yusuf.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, for instance, 1,868 security personnel were killed \u2013 a number almost equal to the total casualties between 2011 and 2017. ISWAP, led by Muhammed Yusuf\u2019s son Abu Musab al-Barnawi between 2016 and 2019, symbolically continues the Boko Haram legacy and is responsible for much of the violence in the Lake Chad Basin, while Abubakar Shekau\u2019s rogue JAS faction has pivoted to a criminal-like operation that targets civilians and engages in systematic looting of property \u2013 despite its leader\u2019s recent death.\n\nAnsaru\n\n\u2018\u2019In the North West, meanwhile, Ansaru is engaged in a long and dangerous game of winning the hearts and minds of locals by mimicking al-Qaeda\u2019s so-called civilian-friendly model. Yet each essentially remains driven by the same ideology of their founding fathers.\n\n\u201cDo not mistake factional disputes and changes in leadership as \u201coperational crises\u201d for terrorist groups. Global jihadi factions are now more prone to splintering and operational divergence than they were 20 years ago. Yet policymakers need only look to Boko Haram to see how it has grown stronger following its factional splits \u2013 an approach that can apply equally to jihadi actors emerging in the Sahel and parts of Syria. Efforts to tackle Boko Haram factions should be tailored to the individual entities that are operating but all bodies, including the UN and military forces involved in the fight against ISWAP, need to recognise that the group\u2019s founding ideology, relationships and local influences still matter today. Whatever incarnations the separate factions might take in the future, they will always carry their Boko Haram doctrines and heritage with them. Policymakers can therefore future proof their strategies by acknowledging that splinter factions will remain Boko Haram at their core.\n\nLast 2 years\n\n\u201cThe threat from Boko Haram became more acute following its splintering into three distinct factions between 2012 and 2016, and the past three years have proved the deadliest ever for security forces battling the group. While international actors have long been driven by the view that Boko Haram and its constituent factions would be weakened by the defeat of the Islamic State (ISIS), this has not come to pass and efforts to defeat the group have fallen short. In fact, the ISIS-allied faction of Boko Haram became stronger after the territorial defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2019. Boko Haram started as a local Islamic movement when a group of radical preachers infiltrated religious, social and political circles in northeastern Nigeria. Nearly 20 years later, the power that Boko Haram wields at the local level continues to sustain it.\u201d\n\nCounterterrorism policies\n\nTracing the group\u2019s origin, the report said: \u201cBoko Haram identified social vulnerabilities in and around the Nigerian city of Maiduguri, particularly among those communities lacking education or with low literacy to enable a sweeping radicalisation campaign across the North East. These at-risk communities became integral to Boko Haram\u2019s funding channels, with militants soliciting donations from locals including prominent and respected figures.\n\n\u201cFor counterterrorism and counter-extremism policies to succeed in the long term, including prevention programmes, they must recognise the ways in which societies are manipulated into the extremist fold. Boko Haram was the first major terrorist group to emerge in Africa. Two decades on, it is one of the most dangerous in the world. Understanding the story of how its members got there and how they sustain their presence to this day is crucial if we are to defeat Boko Haram and jihadi groups elsewhere.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\n\u201cTheir main leader and teacher, Muhammed Yusuf, was a graduate-level student in Islamic studies, with weak Arabic language skills. Their interactions with the Salafi circle of northern Nigeria \u2013 which was led by graduates of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Islamic University of Madinah, who advocated strict adherence to the early Muslim generations or \u201cpious predecessors\u201d in all spheres of life \u2013 played a crucial role in cementing their understanding of Islamism as well as the importance of building a network of followers among the masses. But the future leaders were not grounded in the Salafi canon. None of them studied for an extended period in Nigeria or elsewhere.\n\nREAD ALSO: Over 200 Army officers to write exams in Kaduna\n\nAt the same time, they were taught to loathe Western values and principles from a young age even though they had limited understanding of the associated systems and institutions. Their Sufi upbringing, their active membership of the Muslim Brothers (a group inspired by Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood) and their participation in the Nigerian Salafi circle all shaped Boko Haram\u2019s ideology \u2013 essentially a conglomeration of elements derived from the various groups the leaders had come into contact with. These roots shaped the movement and eventually contributed to Boko Haram\u2019s long-term objective of establishing an Islamic state in Nigeria and across the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nPotential followers\n\n\u201c To comprehend the strategies of a terrorist group and undermine its appeal, governments and policymakers should study the early histories of leading members\n\nPrioritise soft-power policy programmes that aim to equip communities with the basic skills to dispute and counter extremist narratives. While it is difficult to overhaul entire education systems and improve access rates in underdeveloped areas such as Borno and Yobe, more work could be done to equip individuals with the basic skills to consciously disrupt Boko Haram narratives. This could be in the form of existing development programmes run by organisations such as the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), which educates communities in Africa who are vulnerable and hard to reach. Building resilience through the teaching of \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d could compensate for the high illiteracy rates seen in Borno, Yobe and other Nigerian states as well as across the Lake Chad Basin where Boko Haram is still attracting potential followers.\n\n\u201cFor counterterrorism and counterextremism policies to succeed in the long term, including prevention programmes, they must recognise the ways in which societies are manipulated into the extremist fold. Boko Haram was the first major terrorist group to emerge in Africa. Two decades on, it is one of the most dangerous in the world. Understanding the story of how its members got there and how they sustain their presence to this day is crucial if we are to defeat Boko Haram and jihadi groups elsewhere.\n\nOperational expansion\n\n\u201cSince linguistic assimilation has allowed Boko Haram\u2019s founding leaders to target specific communities, counterterrorism and counter extremism efforts need to include anthropological evaluations as part of any planning of operations to combat Boko Haram in Nigeria and across the Lake Chad Basin. As Boko Haram recruits and infiltrates society by channelling its ethnic heritage and expertise, governments and international actors would benefit from an anthropological analysis of cultures and traditions to effectively prevent this exploitation and protect at-risk communities. The authenticity and legitimacy of those challenging Boko Haram on the front lines are essential to a successful countercampaign. Counter-messaging programmes in the Kanuri language such as those on the USAID-backed radio station Dandal Kura should be upscaled and improved. Meanwhile, satellite television channels such as AREWA24 that promote peace building through dramas, movies, documentaries and sports in the Hausa language should integrate Kanuri as well.\n\nFunding\n\n\u201cDonations fundamental to Boko Haram\u2019s take-off came from local community members \u2013 including individuals not officially affiliated with the organisation. Boko Haram raised their initial funds by soliciting donations not only from their members but also from communities who sympathised with \u2013 and were manipulated by \u2013 the group\u2019s causes.\n\nThis grew into a sophisticated funding channel as Boko Haram became more influential in Maiduguri\u2019s religious and social circles. In addition to regular financial contributions from members during Friday services and daily prayers, individuals from the community, including those who weren\u2019t official Boko Haram affiliates, also donated to the organisation \u2013 driven by their desire to aid \u201cthe course of Allah\u201d.\n\nA substantial part of this came from \u201cZakat\u201d, an annual charitable payment made by wealthy Muslims, which Boko Haram then used to cultivate farms and properties as well as empower those who gave parts of their profits to the group.\n\nBoko Haram was able to expand its preaching activities using these funds, namely by building mosques, purchasing vehicles and audio equipment, and completing major property transactions. When the group started to transition to violence, it used donations and contributions to purchase weaponry in the early days of the insurgency, and this income eventually became a vital source of sustainability as the group diversified its operations and expanded its territorial footprint. While funds and supplies from 2011 onwards largely came from the vast land and water resources around Lake Chad, as well as raids or taxation on communities in the region, it is worth noting that the group also used members in disguise and middlemen to smuggle in items they could not produce themselves \u2013 including medicine and ammunition.\n\nTransactions\n\n\u201cThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and similar bodies operating across the Lake Chad Basin need to acknowledge that a significant proportion of Boko Haram\u2019s revenue is sourced from local channels, and not solely via transnational means nor global wire-transfer (such as Hawala networks). Therefore, financial task forces should be educated on the particular local dynamics of terrorist financing in addition to the international dimension.\n\nFurthermore, local authorities should vet and run due diligence on large transactions in their jurisdictions, and flag when unusually large payments are made or buyers raise suspicions. Security forces should step up efforts to block Boko Haram\u2019s finance and supply routes because this is an integral part of any strategy to combat the group\n\nAl-Qaeda and ISIS,\n\nBoko Haram benefited from alliances with al-Qaeda and ISIS, but transnational support was \u2013 and is \u2013 not essential to its survival. Boko Haram\u2019s alliances \u2013 first with al-Qaeda, and then with ISIS \u2013 produced material, logistical and financial support as well as capacity-building benefits that elevated the group\u2019s operations and standing. Consequently, the success of Boko Haram factions especially the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) has in turn benefited ISIS and its bid for global territorial dominance. As such, ISIS regularly draws on the achievements of ISWAP to venerate its own global brand and make stronger appeals for fighters to join one of its insurgencies in other parts of the world. Yet it is an overstatement to portray Boko Haram as a mere puppet or representative of transnational jihadi organisations. ISIS does not essentially control Boko Haram.\n\nWhile al-Qaeda\u2019s support between 2009 and 2010 was vital to the group\u2019s transition to insurgency, ISIS\u2019s support from around 2015 until today has not been instrumental to the survival of the group. Thus, defeating al-Qaeda or ISIS elsewhere will not automatically bring an end to or even weaken Boko Haram. Because of its inherent, homegrown attributes, Boko Haram will survive without such affiliations. The group\u2019s influence via ethnic, religious, social and political channels means their influence around the Lake Chad Basin is more entrenched than ever, irrespective of any global jihadi association. Furthermore, Boko Haram\u2019s major sources of funding remain local whether from farming, fishing and logging or raids on communities in order to secure cattle, food, medicine and taxation from resident\n\nLake Chad basin\n\n\u2018\u2019 Homegrown groups such as Boko Haram (and its most active faction) are standalone threats that should be considered beyond the transnational links they hold with ISIS. Policymakers need to make a distinction between Boko Haram (and its factions) and the Islamic State in counterterrorism and counter extremism programming. The present threat is from ISWAP, who are internationally recognised and supported by ISIS. But ISWAP\u2019s homegrown and localised attributes are more lethal and destabilising than their transnational links with ISIS alone.\n\nWith significant influence in rural parts of the Lake Chad Basin, ISWAP will remain immune to counterterrorism and counter extremism efforts that aim to defeat ISIS in other parts of the world. Therefore, the Multinational Joint Task Force, France, the UK and the US, all of which are actively engaged in the fight against ISWAP, should aim to target both the Boko Haram roots from which ISWAP grew and the supporting Islamic State elements. This could be the basis upon which to tackle other jihadi groups whose alliances with al-Qaeda and ISIS disguise their more hazardous homegrown and localised powers\n\nNigeria, Cameroon, Chad\n\n\u2018\u2019As our final recommendation, we call for all governments directly affected by Boko Haram activities, including those in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, to do more to synchronise their military, deradicalisation and prevention programmes. Terrorism today extends its reach beyond the kinetic and physical \u2013 and governments suffering under the presence of homegrown Islamist organisations have much knowledge to share that illuminates how localised social, political, economic and religious channels are used to nurture jihadi movements. Through improved coordination and information-sharing, leading counterterrorism and counter extremism organisations will be better placed to prevent the emergence and, ultimately, work towards the defeat of jihadist groups such as Boko Haram.\n\nBoko Haram today\n\n\u201cWhile Boko Haram effectively operates as the three distinct factions of ISWAP, JAS and Ansaru, they are still inherently the same. The goal of establishing an Islamic State in Nigeria, and across the Lake Chad Basin, is ideologically ingrained in each faction with the same fervour that drove Yusuf, Ali, Nur and Shekau as they first set foot in Maiduguri years ago. Despite differences that have since led to infighting and splintering, the factions remain united by the core, foundational message of their founders. ISWAP\u2019s operational growth during the past four years has seen it expand its footprint beyond Nigeria into the Lake Chad Basin, with offensives prioritising security personnel and hard targets. Its violence in the region is complicating efforts to alleviate conflict in the Sahel and bring peace and security to West Africa.\n\nJihadist threat\n\n\u201cConversely, JAS has reverted to a criminal-like operation mainly targeting civilians, with its leaders continuing to cite Islamic scripture to justify their violent acts and frame their group as a jihadist one. And just when JAS was able to boast of establishing a territorial presence complete with hundreds of members in northwestern Nigeria, it suffered its biggest setback yet with the recent death of Shekau, which occurred during a renewed factional struggle with ISWAP. Having received direct orders from ISIS to take out Shekau and consolidate the Lake Chad region, ISWAP commanders invaded Shekau\u2019s stronghold in the Sambisa Forest. They cornered Shekau after killing many senior JAS members and demanded that he announce his loyalty to ISWAP, instructing all his followers to do the same. Shekau refused and blew himself up instead, throwing his faction\u2019s future not only in Lake Chad, but across the North West, into uncertainty.\n\nShekau\u2019s death has since taken the ISWAP\u2013JAS battle into uncharted territory with Shekau\u2019s lieutenants launching revenge attacks and ISWAP vowing to eliminate them all.\n\n\u201cFinally, the more recent re-emergence of Ansaru highlights the proliferating jihadist threat in and around Nigeria, where groups born out of operational and ideological differences remain true to the same unified cause and violent ambitions set out by their founding members.\u2019\u2019\n\nAREWA24 that promote peacebuilding through dramas, movies, documentaries and sports in the Hausa language should integrate Kanuri as well.\n\nFunding\n\n\u201cDonations fundamental to Boko Haram\u2019s take-off came from local community members \u2013 including individuals not officially affiliated with the organisation.

          "text": "*Chieftains defect to PDP in Benue\n\n*Ogun denies parallel exercise\n\n*No election in Bayelsa\n\nBy Our Reporters\n\nTHE ward congresses of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, were marred by protests, violence yesterday, as the party chose its ward executives via consensus across the country.\n\nThough largely peaceful, there were pockets of violence in some states just as Ogun State witnessed parallel congressss and emergence of parallel ward executives.\n\nBut the Chairman of Ogun APC Ward Congress Committee, Wale Onu, declared there was no parallel election of party executives in the 236 wards in the state.\n\nThe congresses were peaceful in Kano, Imo, Plateau, Edo, Borno and Nasarawa among other states.\n\nOne feared dead, several\n\nothers injured in Ekiti\n\nViolence characterized the ward congresses of the APC held in Ekiti State, as one person was feared killed and many others injured.\n\nParty faithful as early as 8am trooped out to the ward centers for the election while the voting process did not start until 12noon when the Ward Congress Committee from the national secretariat started distributing election materials.\n\nMultiple sources told newsmen that the deceased who was simply identified as Jide was stabbed to death after violence erupted in Ado Ward 10 after the congress was said to have been concluded.\n\nSources who were at the venue of the Ward 10 congress, which took place at the pavilion close to Fajuyi, said, \u201c After the congress was concluded, the boys who are on drugs had disagreement among themselves and before you know it, it turned to free for all.\n\n\u201c Jide was stabbed and rushed to the General Hospital where he was confirmed dead. This is unfortunate and uncalled for, because it is a mere ward congress.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the violent clash couldn\u2019t have been unconnected with the disagreement over the mode of the Congress, while the loyalists of the governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi rooted for consensus arrangement across the 177 wards, the other faction who were mostly members of the South West Agenda 2023 (SWAGA) resisted this move and insisted on election.\n\nThis development in some of the wards led to widespread violence across the state as thugs were allegedly unleashed on the people with many sustaining injuries and vehicles destroyed.\n\nIn Ado-Ekiti ward 8, thugs unleashed mayhem on party members and disrupted the process. Many of the injured members are receiving medical attention in one of the private hospital in the state capital.\n\nAlso in Ado-Ekiti, there was violence in Ward 4 and 8 as thugs went on rampage to disrupt the voting process.\n\nThe chairperson of Ado local government, Mrs Omotunde Fajuyi who participated in the congress in Ward 10 said the process was peaceful and devoid of any violence.\n\nFajuyi said, \u201c As you aware today, Ward 10 congress was peaceful during the congress and we had only one person who contested for ward chairmanship position, and was elected unopposed.\n\n\u201c The process went peacefully and nobody had any cause to fight but we were told some persons had disagreement later after we left the place and one of them is dead. As I speak with you now, I am going to the hospital.\n\nSpeaking on the ward congress, the state chairman of SWAGA, Senator Tony Adeniyi decried the widespread violence which marred the process, saying that there was no congress in the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201c There was no election today in Ekiti because there was no accreditation across the wards. The Fayemi Tokan Tokan people manipulated the process and prevent people from voting for their prefer leaders, especially SWAGA members.\n\n\u201c I can confirm to you that there was violence in Ikere-Ekiti, virtually all the wards in Ado-Ekiti we had violence and several people wounded and also in Ward 10, someone was killed. Is that how to do a congress ? \u201c\n\nOn his part, a chieftain of the party and governorship aspirant, Chief Reuben Famuyibo, lamented that the politicians failed democracy in the state with the level of violence which characterised the ward congress.\n\nFamuyibo, an elder statesman, who explained that he would address journalists in coming days on the process, said, \u201c As predicted by me on Friday, there was no election today,what you see is thugs moving around the wards.\n\n\u201c The blood of any citizens does not worth my ambition. When I got to the ward today, i returned home, this is not democracy and our politicians have not learnt any election and it is unfortunate. We await what the national secretariat will do it.\u201d\n\nHowever, the party spokesman, Ade Ajayi, denied the allegations by the leaders on the process of the congress, saying every members of the were allowed to participate in congress.\n\n\u201c I can tell you that nobody was deprived from the congress today (Saturday) and it is our hope that it will be an acceptable one by the stakeholders. It is blatant lie to say that people were deprived, people participated in the process.\u201d\n\nProtest, violence mar exercise in Osun\n\nIn Osun State, while the congresses were held peacefully in some wards, there were protest and violence in other wards over mode of conduct\n\nThe Congress Committee from the National Secretariat in the state, headed by Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye monitored the congress at Isedo ward, Ila Orangun, where Chief Bisi Akande was said to be indisposed.\n\nThe team was also at Ward 1, Iragbiji where Governor Adegboyega Oyetola joined party members to adopt the new ward executive committee through consensus before proceeding to Moore Ward 1 where the new executive committee was unanimously affirmed in the presence of Senator Iyiola Omisore.\n\nHowever, the congress was disrupted at Olorunda Ward 8, as party members disagreed on modalities for the congress. While some agreed with consensus others agitated for voting forcing the local congress officials to leave the area after fisticuffs between two members at the scene. At Isale-Oba Ward 4 in Iwo, party members were seen waiting for INEC officials to monitor the process but to no avail, while congress officials had not arrived at Osogbo Ward 4 collation centre before Sunday Vanguard left the centre.\n\nSimilarly at ward 4 in Ejigbo the former Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Najeem Salaam disclosed that members trooped out but after waiting for the Committee from Abuja for hours, the ward congress committee eventually oversaw the process.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Oyetola, Senator Omisore and Prince Famodun disclosed that the consensus method adopted by the party across the state was successful and reduced rancour within the party.\n\nSome armed political thugs, around 11:30am attacked some members of the APC who were on the queue to participate in the party\u2019s congress at Ward 3, Ilesa West Local Government of the State, while hoodlums also harassed participants at Ilare Ward 4 and Iremo Ward 1, Ife Central, while attempting to chase them away from collation centres at Ilare Central Primary School, Ilare and L.A Primary School, Ajebamidele respectively.\n\nElegbeleye, while addressing journalists disclosed that the committee to a large exten was satisfied with the conduct of the congress across the wards, adding that where members disagree on modalities, election should be held to determine the new ward executives.\n\nGov Abiodun, Amosun hold parallel congresses in Ogun\n\nOgun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, and loyalists of his immediate predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun held parallel ward congresses in Ogun.\n\nThe governor joined other party members in his Iperu Ward 3, Ikenne Local Government Area of the state to partake in the party\u2019s Ward Congress and described the exercise as peaceful.\n\nAbiodun, who said this in a chat with newsmen shortly after participating in the Ward Congress where 531 party members partook, noted that he was happy at the turnout of members of the party at the congress.\n\nWhile observing that the exercise was in line with what the Caretaker Extraordinary Committee on Convention Planning had prescribed in preparation for the National Convention of the party, he added that the exercise was the beginning of the house keeping exercise that would ensure that the party has people who are properly voted into office.\n\nAbiodun said that the congress in his ward was a consensus arrangement which was ratified through an electoral process, assuring party faithful that he would ensure that the ward is empowered to perform its duties.\n\nHe further assured the people of Ikenne Local Government that his administration would ensure it completes the Bethel Road, which he said is one of the two roads left for his administration to rehabilitate in the local government.\n\nMeanwhile, loyalists of the immediate past governor of the state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, organised parallel ward congresses\n\nWhen Vanguard monitored the congress at Ward 14, Abeokuta South Local Government, APC members loyal to the former governor held their own ward congress at the St Leo\u2019s Grammar School, Onikoko, while party faithful loyal to Governor Abiodun, held their own congress inside Anglican High School, Quarry Road, Abeokuta.\n\nThe two groups, however, adopted 27-man parallel ward executive members.\n\nGanduje allays fear over annulment of APC ward congress\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano state has allayed fear that the ward congresses would be declared null if the minority judgement of the Supreme Court against the party is something to go by.\n\nGanduje made the disclosure while addressing newsmen at his ward at Ganduje town in Dawakin Tofa local government shortly after the Congress held across the 444 wards of the state.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court judgement has to do with the National Caretaker Committee and what we have here is an Extra Ordinary Committee on Convention of the party.\n\n\u201cThe election in this ward was based on consensus and same applied to all the 44 local government areas in the state\u201d he stated.\n\nWhile commenting on those having reservations on the Ward Congress, he stated that it is natural that people in any democratic contest would definitely not be happy with anything that runs contrary to their personal interest, but what is certain is that the majority will always have their wqy and the minority will have their say.\n\nChairman of the Ward Election Committee of the APC who was in Kano to supervise the election, Dr Tony described it as hitch- free as there was no violence and all the seats were declared unopposed.\n\nAPC ward Congress precursor to winning back Edo \u2013 Chairman\n\nChairman of the Ward Congress Committee for Edo State, Dr. Chris Oghenechovwen, said the exercise in the state was the beginning of the process of winning back the governorship seat of the state it lost in 2020.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after moving round some wards where they all agreed on consensus for the ward leaders, Oghenechovwen called on other parties across the country to borrow a leaf from the Edo state chapter of APC where its 192 wards executives emerged by consensus to avoid disharmony among their members.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are happy and we want to call on other states to emulate the example of Edo State and we know when a house is together, it can only move forward and that Edo State APC will be much stronger and by 2024, will probably take over the government of the state\u201d.\n\nOn his part, state chairman of the party,\n\nCol David Imuse (rtd), said the peaceful conduct of the Congress has made APC the party to beat come 2024 in the state.\n\nAPC suffers blow in Benue as stalwarts defect to PDP\n\nThe APC in Benue state, weekend suffered a major blow by the unexpected defection of its stalwart, Engineer Nath Apir alongside his followers and supporters, to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Gwer East Local Government Area, LGA, of the state.\n\nAmong those who defected with their supporters alongside Engineer Apir during the ceremony held at St. Francis Primary School Aliade, were Engineers Rogers and Peter Damkor as well as Elder John Asen including members of the Labour Party, LP and All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA in the area.\n\nSpeaking separately on why they defected to the PDP, the APC stalwarts cited the forthrightness, resilience and doggedness of Governor Samuel Ortom in standing against external aggressors who want to takeover the state and subjugate the people, for their decision to leave their former parties.\n\nThey also referred to the numerous appointments to their people and projects executed in their LGA as some of the motivating factors.\n\nBayelsa APC makes u-turn, shelves ward congress over court injunction\n\nTHE APC in Bayelsa State appears to have decided to obey the order of a state high court which granted an interim injunction stoping the exercise in the state.\n\nA Bayelsa State High Court presided over by Enekinimi Uzaka, in a ruling on Friday ordered a stop to the proposed congress pending the determination of the motion of notice before the court.\n\nSome aggrieved members of APC in Bayelsa State, Mr Ompadec Victor, Esuenifen Obi and Seimiegha Ebibofe Agbozu had filed a suit seeking the court Interim injunction stopping the conduct of the ward Congress in the state.\n\nIn a suit numbered YHC/07/2021, with the All Progressive Congress (APC) as the only respondent, the claimants asked the court to restrain the Party\u2019s caretaker/extra ordinary Convention Committee from assigning or conducting Congress to elect state, local government and ward party leaders in the state scheduled for Saturday 31st, July, 2021 until the determination of the motion on notice already before the court\n\nThe court however adjourned the matter to the 9th of August for the hearing of the motion before it\n\nBut the factions of the party in the state loyal to both the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HMSPR, Chief Timipre Sylva and former Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri had on Friday sworn to go ahead with the exercise despite the court order.\n\nChecks by our reporter who monitored the exercise in some parts of the state observed that the exercise did not take place.\n\nConfirming the party\u2019s decision to discontinue with the exercise, the Caretaker Secretary of the party in the state, Mr Alabo Martins in a statement on Saturday, said as a law abiding party, the APC would not take laws into its hands by going contrary to the court injunction as any unguided moves would jeopardize the effort the party has made so far.\n\nAlmakura, NSHA Speaker others lauds excercise\n\nThe exercise in Nasarawa Statewas dominated by concensus as most aspirants emerged through consensus\n\nSpeaking during the exercise, the Senator representing Nasarawa South,Tanko Almaku commended stakeholders of the APC for the strict adherence to guidelines of the party to ensure peaceful conduct of Ward Congresses in the state.\n\nAlmakura who gave the commendation after participating in the exercise in his Gayam Electoral Ward, Lafia the Nasarawa State capital, said APC had some lessons to learn for future congresses and elections especially the adoption of consensus leaders through mutual agreement devoid of rancour and hard feelings among supporters of the party.\n\nOn his part, Speaker Nasarawa state House of Assembly, Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi Lauded the Peaceful APC Ward Congress in Toto Saying the exercise Further Demonstrate Unity,Strength of party.\n\nIbrahim Balarabe Abdullahi who expressed satisfaction with the peaceful conduct of APC ward congress in Toto LG as all the new officials emerged through consensus said the success achieved in the exercise is a clear demonstration of unity and understanding among members and called for its sustenance.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Uja Emmanuel, Makurdi\n\nThere is anxiety in Makurdi, the Benue state capital as the adducted wife of Commissioner for Land and Survey, Mrs. Ann Unenge, spent three nights with her abductors. Her abductors yesterday evening demanded for a ransom of N51million before she would be released. They had kept the family, especially the husband, Bernard Unenge, in suspense till yesterday evening when they used the victim\u2019s number to call Unenge and a few other persons and demanded for a ransom.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA close family who spoke to The Nation on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter said the adductors phoned between 6- 7pm yesterday night. At press time negotiation was said to be going between the family and the adductors. The gunmen had on Thursday waylaid Mrs. Unenge in her Highlander jeep with Benue registration number MKD 288.\n\nRead Also: Abductors of Kaduna Emir demand N200m ransom\n\nThe incident, which is the second in the area within six days, has caused panic among residents of Makurdi. Those who spoke to The Nation said if a wife of a serving commissioner can be easily abducted, then no one is safe in Benue. The Nation gathered from a relation of the commissioner who pleaded anonymity because he was not permitted to speak that Mrs. Ann was abducted in Makurdi shortly after she returned from Daudu town, where she went to visit her parents.\n\nThe Nation gathered that there was a struggle between the abductors and Mrs. Unenge at B. Division traffic junction when she attempted to force open the car door and flee. The gun men reportedly shot sporadically into the air at the traffic junction to scare away passerby before driving recklessly away with their victim who was heard shouting on top of her voice.

The first stands for politicking and the other for governance. We try as much as possible to create room for each of them to get the maximum benefit of the opportunities that are available. As it is, we went through an electoral process; elected officers into different levels, so we will allow them to do governance. As for politicking, we are still very much in touch with our people at home and we are still much organised. I am happy to tell you that we have one of the most stable PDP organisation within any sub-national today. This is because the structures are well laid out. We have really come together to understand what were the challenges and we have since proffered solutions that will help us in the next elections. But most importantly, we have come to terms with the reality of things happening globally especially in Nigeria and we recognise that these are times we have to reposition ourselves and redirect our energy to meet the needs of the people in their current position. These are the areas we are really working on and we hope to change. For us, these things are done quietly because we are not in government and that is why it looks as if we are off the radar. However, in reality we are still within the radar, meeting up with our people at all levels both at state, senatorial, local government and ward levels. We are quite organised and I can proudly tell you that we are one of the most organised PDP state chapters in Nigeria. I promise it will probably get better and stronger.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you retire to the upper chambers like other governors after your eight-year tenure?\n\nThe issue of going to the Senate was not something I truly looked forward to. But there are times you work in the interest of people that are supporting you. They actually wanted me to go to the Senate, but in reality, I had always wanted to see myself in an environment where I could exact my wealth of experience to help build and make systems work. It made me fit in more in the executive arm rather than trying to see myself making enabling laws that will allow for programmes and activities to happen. Yes, an attempt was made for me to go to the Senate, but having been prevailed on by some sections of my Senatorial District that I should give an opportunity for the then serving senator for the second term in consideration for rotation which creates sense of equity and calm nerves that would hitherto have been heated. So, to that extent, I saw it more like a sense of sacrifice because I looked at the bigger opportunities that lie in making myself available in different areas other than the legislative arm. I am still looking forward to opportunities in whichever way it comes to contribute towards making Nigeria better.\n\nDid you have any regret leaving the APC as at the time you left?\n\nWell, I will say not really. There was no regret because as at the time we took the decision to leave the APC, it was the best decision at that time for us. Don\u2019t also forget that activities in life are transactional. And we get the opportunity with the benefit of hindsight to review things that happened. Within the context of where we found ourselves at that time that was the best decision we took. Yes, it could have had its different side in terms of expectations, but don\u2019t forget that we also took a similar decision in 2014, but because it paid off, it looked like a better decision. In life, it is neither here or there, especially in politics where there are so many exogenous factors playing out. We are left within the sphere of manoeuvre based on information available to you to take decisions and bring it to the desirable expectations.\n\nDid it come to you as a surprise that the Otoge Movement collapsed like badly arranged cards this soon?\n\nFor a contemporary observer of political activism in Kwara, especially looking back a bit beyond the current situations we have, if you give it a historical look, what happened, the way it happened and what is happening now, you could probably plot in a graph and work things out to give you a better picture of what is going on now. As it is today, for anybody who saw the way the election went through, there was a lot of federal might that was largely downplayed by the media to make it look as if it was a hands down victory. However, be it as it may, the forces that came together to form the opposition at that time, were not really homogeneous. They still retain their heterogeneity to the extent that they felt that they had a common front they needed to tackle, with the understanding that they are going to work things out when victory is gotten. A lot of people don\u2019t know that it is not victory that is usually the situation, but managing the victory. The biggest challenge is always managing victory not getting it especially in a politicking system. Victory comes with lots of expectations, lots of demands both institutional and personal. Patronages will be expected on to and the way and manner you navigate through these and still come out with what you think meets up with your political promises, is left to you to really work on and for people to judge you. However, as it is today, I feel it is not the best of times for the party and its government. Some of us actually feel very worried to the extent that governance has been affected. Party belongs to those in the party, but governance is for everybody. Party is supposed to be an instrument to deliver governance and since at the moment it is not meeting the expectations of the people because of the distraction going on, it calls for concern for an average Kwaran. The good thing is that you don\u2019t need to ask again whether it is going to be a blessing in disguise for the PDP. We are all mutually exclusive and two parties cannot be there at the same time and the weaker your opposition is getting, the more you position yourself to strategically take over. It is only normal anywhere in the world.\n\nWhat is your deepest regret as governor for eight years?\n\nYou see, we are human and largely driven by expectations. Even as humans, if we flash back at our actions in life, you will naturally feel that there were things you would have done differently. It is part of being human. The truth is that I came with an expectation to serve the people with clear set programmes and policies and had expectations on resources that will be available to execute these programmes, but some of the resources could not come as a result of global, national and sub-national economic situations. So, naturally, there are things I wished I could have done that I could not do.\n\nWhat is your take on the impression in certain quarters that you didn\u2019t live up to your potential as governor considering your background?\n\nI will disagree with you. I lived up to my top potential, but not optimal because of resource constraints. For example, there was a time we thought we were going to raise money from the capital market, we had programmes well laid out, but that was the same year there was economy recession. That was in 2014, 2015, and 2016 when we had drop in the price of crude oil, which came with very low revenues into the state coffers. Don\u2019t forget that the capacity to raise money in the Capital Market is hinged on that revenue inflow. So, the lower it is, the lower the volume of money you can access from the Capital Market. It got to the extent that some states had to be bailed out when this current administration came in because of low revenues. So, it was not a good time for us to enter the Capital Market. That was the beginning of our second term. However, we still demonstrated ingenuity in areas that changed the financial models especially in the internally generated revenue when we moved to over 400 per cent in the state where we were able to have the most improved IGR especially in Northern Nigeria with close to N3 billion monthly inflow from only 16 local governments. This saw us creating a new funding window for capital project that cut across infrastructure, human capital development and state economy. In short, we were able to bring out some new things especially driven out of necessity for Kwara State.\n\nIs this the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThis is certainly not the Nigeria of my dream. Having had the experience of military administration, coming in through to the current democratic dispensation which started in 1999, the way institutions were built to support governance, and how things were carried on, the way we were received globally at the ushering of democracy at that time, the way Nigerians in Diaspora began to pour in, the way we had a recreation of the middle class, and the way things began to change in Nigeria, came with lots of hope for us. We did not only see Nigeria beginning to grow, but saw opportunities, strong innovation and also room for strong innovation, and we saw room for a system of governance that can organise us into one nation, way beyond what almost set us apart in 1967. However, looking back now, I see that the Nigeria of my dream has not been fulfilled for obvious reasons. We are currently faced with an unprecedented level of insecurity attempting to make a mockery of every progress that has been made. There has been progress that has been made in some key areas where we expect that Nigerians should ordinarily begin to take advantage of the opportunities, but unfortunately, the current insecurity is taking its toll on these gains made. Yes, CBN is really supportive of the agricultural sector with its funding windows and key areas supporting farming, but these farmers cannot farm because of insecurity. The security situation is making every other effort look very sub-optimal because it affects every area where progress is expected to be felt and change the lives of people. This is why I said that this is not the Nigeria of my dreams. Security is one area we must recognise as having one common challenge if we truly want to move forward as a people.\n\nWhat are the practical solutions to approach the insecurity in the country?\n\nThe security situation in Nigeria is multi-faceted. In my opinion, there are causative factors and consequences coming with it. The causative factors are the factors coming with peoples expectations from government in making the environment lot more enabling especially in areas of human capital development, like opportunities for the teeming youths to get engaged. These deficiencies span beyond current administration because we have not really had proper planning for engagement of the youths into our economy. We have not stimulated the private sector enough especially in terms of support in infrastructure and policies. If we had, we would have seen things like factories and other manufacturing outfits working this expanding, creating new consumption patterns and opening up new levels of employment. Except for telecommunication and entertainment, very few areas have attempted to absolve the youths. Again, the system of education has not also helped matters. It keeps churning out the type of youths that that have not been prepared for the current global digital economy. The focus should be on what people can do rather than on certification. The second leg is that we have allowed those areas of differences between us that should ordinarily be a strength to become punch lines. It has not allowed us to enjoy the sweetness that comes with unity in diversity and the strength in unity in diversity. We have been robbed of that sweetness. We have allowed some people within the system, to a large extent, use these dichotomies as punch lines. Unfortunately, it is coming at the time when the human capital development scheme is not meeting the needs of the people. Everybody is looking for where to anchor his anger. It is only natural especially in our kind of society that is heavily eaten into by residual superstitious belief, which hinders our capacity to probe and proffer solutions. I would like to say that all these I have enumerated are build ups of over two, three decades coming in pockets that were not recognized at that time they were building up. The immediate one is the way and manner we have allowed the security agencies to be overstretched because we did not prepare for the kind of insecurity and criminalities going on, leading to high level and impunity. People commit crimes because they know that they can get away with it. This has exacerbated criminal activities in the northern part of Nigeria where kidnappings are going on and in the southern part where other forms of criminalities are going on. These things have now gotten to levels of driving people to look at the possibility of separation. Unfortunately, the problems are very simple. We have not allowed the rule of law to take its course. That is, we have not allowed for equity, justice and compliance. If these things I enumerated are put in place we will begin to see light at the end of the tunnel in terms of security challenges. One of the things we need to tinker with to create a sense of bond within us are not too many. That is the agitations for true federalism, which will not only stimulate personal efforts, but also create a better economy. However, looking at the current quasi-unitary system we are running, we will require a process to migrate us towards true federalism. Some of these include the indices used in the federation allocation. For instance, we could change the weighting attached to IGR efforts. We have to also improve on concurrence in some of the exclusive areas. This will automatically begin to strengthen sub-national capacities to drive revenue and execute projects that will be people-oriented. These are some of the things we should look at from the type of new Nigeria that we have in minds. I also think that if as a nation in the current situation we are discussing restructuring, electoral processes, new ways of setting up new governments, I think we should begin to look at some of these agitations and see how we can genuinely incorporate them into a short, medium to long term migration to true federalism.\n\nWhat are your fears for 2023 elections, especially the rumble at the National Assembly over electronic transmission of election results?\n\nI have always said that any democratic good governance anywhere in the world starts with a good electoral process. The process I am referring to is the one that starts with having a transparent, acceptable electoral process whose results will not be challenged. Parties involved will be satisfied with the transparency. Anything short of that will not give you the kind of required result. Once you compromise the electoral process, you have compromised the selection process. And that means we have to live with the consequences that come with that. It is a choice of ensuring that you have a proper electoral process that will be acceptable to a majority of Nigerians and you create the right expectations. It will be a major improvement if we do not only strengthen the card reader use, but also ensure that results are transmitted electronically. Once this is done, it enhances the confidence that people will have on the result released. Above all, levels of human interference will be minimised. It will to a large extent give us the kind of result we want to see that will reflect the will of the people and any government that comes out of that, so be it. We should look very seriously at the yearnings of Nigerians with respect to ensuring that we improve on 2015, 2019 processes that will ensure an electoral process acceptable to Nigerians especially if it is driven electronically and is allowed to come through. In other words, what I am saying is that our inability to deploy a credible electronic process is my biggest fear for the 2023 elections. It will certainly affect it because transmitting electronically lessens the room for benefit of doubt.\n\nWill you contest in the 2023 elections?\n\nIt is very clear that I will not be contesting at the sub-national level having had the opportunity of been a two-time governor. But I will, however, make myself available to serve at different levels where the opportunities come up either at elective or appointive capacity. But I am not a fan of the National Assembly in terms of wanting to go there as a legislator.\n\nDo you think that the PDP is strong enough to wrest power from the APC in 2023?\n\nTime alone will tell. PDP is truly making efforts to put its piece and pieces together. Yes, it might not be the best of effort, especially finding itself in the current levels of opposition. It is trying its best to see how to fight as an opposition. There is much more room for better things to be done. I am sure that the party is not unaware of some of these opportunities and when the time for real politicking comes, we will begin to see those things that will either show that it has taken the opportunity or not. It is too early to begin to judge.\n\nDid the decision by the three PDP governors to join the APC come to you as a shock?\n\nIt did not come to me as a surprise looking at the history of the PDP where it has been, where it is now and what it is currently doing. There is still a lot of room for strengthening and partnering with others. But it is also a reflection of weak cohesion among the leaders of the party. The cohesion is weak to the extent that getting a workable and proactive solution is sometimes herculean even when there are differences. Don\u2019t also forget that their decision to leave is personal, but just a coincidence that they are holding the office as governors.\n\nZoning arrangement has become the most controversial thing in almost all the political parties, what is your take on it?\n\nWe have found ourselves at a very tough time in Nigeria because we are faced with an unprecedented level of insecurity, unprecedented level of economic pressure; nerves have gotten hurt and most importantly a high level of youth agitation, especially our current demographic composition. What it means is that the kind of problem we are facing requires somebody who will do the job of the narrative. In the choice of who will do the job, there will be so many considerations. But, I think that the most critical one that should matter to an average Nigerian is the person that will do the job. The person that will bring succour to the current security challenges, come with an improved way of navigating the economy to stimulate those areas, expand and allow for innovation, strong synergy between the federal agencies between the federal agencies, the state and LGA to see the optimal use of the resources at the three layers. Lack of synergy brings about lots of duplicity and standalone programmes that we are not able to benefit from. We need that kind of leadership that can ensure that these things are optimised. We need a leadership that will strongly look at our current educational system and ensure that we improve on hands-on training. By stimulating our economy, there is an all-African free trade coming up soon where a critical mass of 200 million people with 65 per cent being youths. How can we translate this potential into an economic workforce so that we can become the leader? These are the things that should decide the kind of leadership we are looking for. All these qualities have nothing to do with religion, geography. We know what to do in Nigeria and how to do it, but our biggest challenge is that we have not gotten people, those with that level of commitment. Zoning can be achieved through inclusiveness at different layers of governance without compromising quality, capacity, eligibility and suitability. Don\u2019t forget that there are several areas that allow for power sharing in a synergised leadership scheme. Who is that Nigeria that can tie us together because he understands these diversities as our strengths? This is what we should be looking for as a country, not zoning.\n\nFrom the classroom to the banking hall and then politics, is this trajectory the career path you set for yourself?\n\nFirstly, I only became a teacher by accident. By the nature of the discipline I read in school, Chemistry, I always look forward to working in the quality control unit of a manufacturing outfit. But when opportunity did not come on time, I took up a teaching job. Then along the line, I began to develop interest in the financial world and saw myself gravitating toward that largely supported by my quantitative mindedness. So, seeing me working in the bank and moving into politics especially through the gateway of being a Commissioner for Finance just saw me doing the same thing, but in an expanded platform. Being the governor also is not far away from that too. For me, I have had quite and exciting career beyond my imagination and the gratitude goes to God Almighty, my parents and the people I met along that helped me to strengthen my potential in ways and manner that I am happy with.\n\nDid you keep killer squad as governor like others as they claim?\n\nMost of those things are myths. Governors are normal people that live among others. We go to the market when we leave office and some people chose to live larger than life posture, but some of us prefer to be very simplistic. It is a choice, but the reality is that most of what you hear are myths created by people around them rather than reflecting who they have demonstrated to be.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Executive Director in charge of Projects at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Dr. Cairo Ojougboh, and former governorship candidates of the party, Olorogun O\u2019tega Emerhor and Chief Great Ogboru, also distanced themselves from the exercise in Delta State with thousands of their supporters on account of the alleged hijack of the congress materials by the loyalists of the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nAPC members backed by Senators Rochas Okorocha and Ifeanyi Ararume, also shunned the exercise in Imo State, just as the loyalists of Senator Magnus Abe boycotted the congress in Rivers State for the supporters of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, the supporters of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, accused the Secretary of the National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe of manipulating the exercise.\n\nAPC members loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, also kicked against the adoption of consensus arrangement by the loyalists of Governor Gboyega Oyetola in Osun State.\n\nHowever, despite the protests, the APC last night hailed the conduct of the congresses across the states, saying that its National caretaker chairman and Yobe State Governor, Mr. Mai Mala Buni, was not distracted.\n\nSupporters of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Akpabio, organised a protest at the party\u2019s secretariat along Ikot Ekpene Road, Uyo, the state capital.\n\nThe bonfire was set outside the party office, causing heavy gridlock along the major access road outside the Uyo metropolis.\n\nThe protesters demanded the cancellation of the ward congress, alleging that Akpanudoedehe \u201cfraudulently manipulated the lists to include only his loyalists as candidates for the congresses\u201d.\n\nSome of the placards displayed during the protest read: \u201cAkpanudoedehe cannot decide for us in Akwa Ibom\u201d; \u201cThe list cannot stand;\u201d \u201cWe reject this shambolic manipulation by one man\u201d; This congress cannot hold\u201d and \u201cEnough of one-man dictatorship in Akwa Ibom APC.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, stakeholders under the aegis of APC Elders Forum led by the Board of Trustees (BoT) member, Group Captain Sam Ewang (rtd), had passed a vote of no confidence on the state caretaker Chairman, Dr. Ita Udosen, alleging that he was playing the card of Akpanudoedehe by manipulating the exercise and doctoring the candidates\u2019 list in his favour.\n\nThe crisis rocking the Kwara State chapter of the ruling APC deepened yesterday as the two leading factions in the party embarked on separate congresses to elect their ward executives at the 193 wards in the state.\n\nA group loyal to the state Governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, under the platform of AA Group adopted a consensus arrangement for the emergence of their executives at the ward congresses.\n\nBut a group loyal to the Information Minister, Mohammed, under the platform of the Loyal Group used direct system for the emergence of their ward executives in the state.\n\nMembers of the APC in Osun State also yesterday adopted consensus in the election of their leaders across the 332 wards in the state amidst allegations of exclusion by loyalists of Minister of Interior, Aregbesola.\n\nA loyalist of the minister and former Osun State Assembly Speaker, Hon. Najeem Salam, who was at Ward 4, Ejigbo, alleged that the executives were imposed, and not elected.\n\nBut the Chairman of the National Congress Committee, Mr. Gbenga Elegbeleye, said the exercise was successful.\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola also said the congresses across the state were very peaceful.\n\n\u201cYou can see that members of the party are here, you know, in their large number to endorse the congress done in line with the directive of the national secretariat. It is free. Everybody has been allowed to express their wish, and you have seen it.\u201d\n\nIn Imo State, former Governor Rochas Okorocha and his supporters did not participate in the ward congresses.\n\nIn the same vein, another chieftain of the party, Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, and his loyalists did not also participate in the congresses.\n\nHowever, the supporters of the state Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, held the ward congress in all the 27 local government areas of the state in a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nIn his reaction, the factional chairman of the party loyal to the Okorocha, Mr. Daniel Nwafor, said they boycotted the congress concerning the court order.\n\nAn Abuja High Court presided over by Justice Valentine Oriji, had on Friday in a suit filed by Mr. Okey Anyikwa, the APC chairman in Ideato South Local Government Area, suspended the congress in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, one person was reportedly killed in Ado Ekiti during the exercise.\n\nThe man, simply identified as Jide, was said to have been hit with a charm when two rival groups clashed at Ward 10 in Ado Ekiti.\n\nAnother account said he was stabbed to death by thugs, who invaded the ward after the result of the exercise was not in their favour.\n\nAlso in Ado Ekiti Ward 08, where the Deputy Governor, Chief Bisi Egbeyemi, and the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, hailed from, the exercise was marred with violence as anti- and pro- Fayemi groups engaged in a fight.\n\nIn Wards 04 and 08, as well as some wards in Ikere Ekiti, Fayemi\u2019s loyalists and the members of the Tinubu group named South-west Agenda for 2023 (SWAGA) also engaged in a fierce battle.\n\nConfirming the killing, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Police Command, ASP Sunday Abutu, said the incident occurred at the Fajuyi area, when some people were celebrating their victory in the congress.\n\n\u201cA few hours ago, we got a distress call that someone was beaten with substance suspected to be charm during APC congress.\n\n\u201cThe police rushed to the area and by the time we got there, the person had been moved to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that he was beaten with charm and later died in the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nAbutu stated that his men and officers had begun an investigation into the matter, while clarifying that no arrest had been made as at press time.\n\nIt was gathered that the resistance put up by members of SWAGA, who turned up in large numbers, actually sparked up the crisis as Fayemi\u2019s supporters were also resolute to assert their supremacy.\n\nIn Lagos State, the leader of a group within the APC, Lagos4Lagos, Mr. Olajide Adediran, told THISDAY that his faction held a parallel congress.\n\n\u201cYes, all our members filed out today across all the 245 wards to affirm all members of our group, who paid for nomination forms, but were not given the forms because the delegation from the National secretariat saddled with the responsibility of selling forms alleged that the governor of Lagos State hijacked the forms from them. We will then send our exco list alongside evidence of payment to Abuja. We will all take it up from there,\u201d he said.\n\nBut amidst the reports that parallel ward congresses were conducted in the state, the party\u2019s Caretaker Committee Chairman, Alhaji Tunde Balogun, has debunked the report even as he maintained that members of the party adopted a consensus arrangement to elect the 37 executive members in each of the 245 wards across the 20 local governments and 37 development councils in the state.\n\n\u201cParallel \u2013 I don\u2019t know that one. I want people to stop emphasising things that will create problems in our fold. Make us cohesive, not emphasising a particular candidate or person trying to do something,\u201d he added.\n\nThe party, in a press statement signed by the state\u2019s Publicity Secretary, Mr. Seye Oladejo, said the ward congress was a success in the state.\n\nIn Kano State, the Chairman of Buhari Support Organisation (BSO), Mr. Shehu Dalhatu also kicked against the consensus arrangement adopted by the loyalists of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje.\n\nDalhatu argued that the party members should be allowed to exercise their franchise.\n\n\u201cWe are here to exercise our franchise. We came to witness justice and seek justice.\n\n\u201cThe statement by Governor Ganduje on the resolution to adopt consensus candidates is unfortunate. That is premeditating the election,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Ganduje has allayed the fear that the nationwide ward congresses would be voided following the recent judgment of the Supreme Court.\n\nGanduje spoke to reporters at his ward at Ganduje town in Dawakin Tofa LGA, shortly after the congress held across the 484 wards in the state.\n\nWhile commenting on those having reservations on the Ward Congress, Ganduje stated that it was natural that people in any democratic contest would not be happy with anything that runs contrary to their interest.\n\nThe Enugu APC ward congress was also characterised by the allegation of missing result sheets across the 260 wards in the state.\n\nHowever, the congress took place peacefully despite a suit instituted by aggrieved members seeking to stop the exercise in the state.\n\nFour aggrieved members of the party had on Friday dragged some officials to the Enugu High Court, alleging that the exercise had already been compromised and urged the court to stop it.\n\nHowever, the party yesterday observed the congress with the adoption of consensus option in several wards and voting by delegates where the consensus option failed.\n\nBut some party leaders alleged that the officials deployed to the 260 wards for the exercise did not go to the congress venues with the result sheets.\n\nThey claimed the result sheets were not handed over to them.\n\nWhen contacted, the chairman of the party in the state, Dr. Ben Nwoye, confirmed he received the reports about the missing result sheets.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that in all the 260 wards, I have received calls that there were no results sheets. It was INEC officials that first alerted me about it,\u201d Nwoye said.\n\nHe, however, said the exercise was peaceful and there was no parallel congress across the state.\n\nAPC Hails Congresses, Says Buni Not Distracted\n\nMeanwhile, the National Secretary of the party, Akpan-udoedehe, has said the Chairman of the Committee and the Governor of Yobe State, Buni was never distracted, but kept faith with the party\u2019s Ward Congresses\u2019 date held yesterday.\n\nHe rated the conduct of the ward congresses across the country high despite reports of pockets of crisis in some states.\n\nAkpan-udoedehe, while reacting to the conduct of the exercise in a telephone interview attributed the success of the exercise to the support of President Muhammadu Buhari and the doggedness of Buni.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI want to thank Mr. President and our National Chairman (Buni). They did not succumb to all the plots to make us look back at the caretaker committee level. The chairman is not moved by all the distractions. He kept faith with the date. He has been focused and keeping to the agenda of the party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Suffers losses in mobile, data subscriptions\n\nEmma Okonji\n\nMTN Nigeria yesterday declared revenue of N790.3 billion, representing an increase of 24.1 per cent in its unedited half year results for the period that ended on June 30, 2021.\n\nThe company\u2019s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA), grew by 27.6 per cent to reach N417.2 billion. The EBITDA margin improved by 1.4 percentage points to 52.7 per cent and its Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) was up by 39.1 per cent to reach N186.4 billion.\n\nIts dividend per share rose to N4.55 kobo, which is about 30 per cent increase.\n\nThe telecoms company, however, suffered losses in the number of mobile subscribers and data subscriptions.\n\nAccording to the report, mobile subscribers declined by 7.6 million to 68.9 million, impacted by the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations.\n\nActive data users also declined by approximately 52,000 to 32.5 million.\n\nGiving details of the telecoms company\u2019s operational review for the half year, MTN Nigeria CEO, Mr. Karl Toriola said: \u201cService revenue grew by 24.1 per cent, Year-on-Year (YoY), driven by the sustained growth in data and also partly due to the lower base in comparative 2020 voice revenue that resulted from lockdowns during that period.\n\n\u201cVoice revenue grew by 13.1 per cent, benefitting from an 11.8 per cent increase in traffic and our customer value management (CVM) initiatives. The impact on voice revenue from the industry-wide suspension of new SIM registration was partly offset by higher usage in our active SIM base as well as migration to a higher quality of experience.\n\n\u201cData revenue continued the positive momentum from H2 2020, rising by 48.3 per cent,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said this was driven by increased usage from the existing base, supported by the acceleration in our 4G rollout and enhanced network capacity following the acquisition and activation of additional 800MHz spectrum in Q1.\n\nThe results showed that data traffic rose by 83.0 per cent YoY, while smartphone penetration was up by 5.8pp to 49.3 per cent.\n\n\u201cOur 4G network now covers 65.1 per cent of the population, up from 60.1 per cent in December 2020,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, Fintech revenue rose by 48.2 per cent driven by increased adoption of Xtratime and the core fintech services.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expand our MoMo agent network and broaden our service offerings. Our registered MoMo agents increased by 121,000 in H1 2021 to more than 515,000,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting further on the results, Toriola said: \u201cIn the first half of 2021, we made good progress strengthening the resilience of the business, managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and enhancing support to our people, customers and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe extended our commitment to the Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) with an additional N3 billion contribution over a two-year period, half of which has already been paid. This is in support of efforts to promote the health and security of Nigerians, as we navigate our way through the pandemic, and in line with our Y\u2019ello Hope initiatives through which we provided support to our broad base of stakeholders to the value of approximately N25 billion in 2020.\n\n\u201cOur progress towards achieving greater business resilience is reflected in the upgrade by Global Credit Ratings (GCR) of our national scale long-term issuer rating to AAA and affirmation of our national scale short-term rating of A1+ with a stable outlook. This puts MTN Nigeria on the highest possible GCR scale for short-term and long-term ratings, providing a solid platform for growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, 2021 would mark the 20th anniversary of MTN\u2019s presence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate this milestone, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved our participation in the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit (RITC) Scheme. This is in response to government\u2019s drive towards public-private partnerships in the rehabilitation of critical road infrastructure in Nigeria. We intend to participate in the restoration and refurbishment of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway. Conversations in this regard have already commenced, and further announcements will be made in due course,\u201d Toriola explained.\n\n\u201cIn line with our desire to plant deeper and more permanent roots in Nigeria, we have also initiated plans to commission a purpose-built, state of the art MTN Head Office, designed to act as a central hub for our network, a catalyst for creativity and innovation, and a showcase for the flexible working structures that are driving efficiency gains in this new normal working environment.\n\n\u201cAligned with our wider commitment to environmental sustainability, it will meet the highest global environmental standards, demonstrating the role of green technology in our future,\u201d Toriola added.\n\nHe promised that MTN would continue to invest in improved world class services and its network, accelerating the expansion of its 4G coverage and providing home broadband.\n\n\u201cAs part of our rural connectivity programme, we plan to connect approximately 1,000 rural communities to our network this year with an additional 2,000 communities in 2022. We are delighted that these are translating into strong operational performance in line with the objectives of Ambition 2025. In the next three years, we will invest over N600 billion to expand broadband access across the country in support of the government\u2019s broadband plan,\u201d Toriola further explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Resident Doctors to Resume Nationwide Indefinite Strike Tomorrow",
          "text": "*Consultants give 21-day ultimatum\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nNigeria\u2019s health sector is about to face another round of crisis as the resident doctors have resolved to commence a nationwide indefinite industrial action tomorrow (Monday).\n\nThis is coming as the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) has given the federal government and the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) a 21-day ultimatum to halt persistent cut in wages of members or face total and indefinite nationwide strike action.\n\nThe resident doctors, under the auspices of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), said they would embark on the strike due to the failure by the federal and state governments to attend to the issues affecting the welfare of its members.\n\nThe doctors said they were dismayed that despite several meetings with the Presidential Committee on Salaries and other top government stakeholders on the review of hazard allowance for health workers, the allowance still remained a paltry sum of N5,000.\n\nThey also noted the alleged non-payment of COVID-19 inducement allowance to some of its members in federal and state tertiary institutions.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, NARD said: \u201cAfter critical appraisal of the performance of both federal and state governments on all the issues affecting the welfare of our members as observed above and the insincerity of government in implementing the Memorandum of Action after 113 days, the NEC unanimously resolved by vote to resume the total and indefinite strike action from 08.00hrs on Monday, August 2, 2021\u201d.\n\nThe doctors demanded the immediate withdrawal of the circular removing House Officers from the scheme of service.\n\nThey also decried the undue hardship doctors on GIFMIS platform were facing due to the delays in payment of their salary arrears ranging from three to seven months.\n\nNARD further expressed concern over the poor response of most state governments in domesticating the Medical Residency Training Act of 2017 while commending states like Delta and Benue, which have adopted the law.\n\nIn addition, NARD lamented the acute manpower shortage in most tertiary health institutions and the attendant burnout effects on its members.\n\nIt said the situation has been made worse by the ongoing deadly brain drain decimating the nation\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nThe association also accused the Registrar of Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria, Dr. T B Sanusi of non- remittance of its membership dues.\n\nIt stated that its members were committed to the smooth running of the health sector, adding however that they can only do so when their welfare is given the desired attention.\n\nHowever, the Minister of Labour and Employment Senator Chris Ngige had said a lot of progress had been made in the implementation of the Memorandum of Agreement with the resident doctors.\n\nSpeaking shortly after a recent meeting of the federal government\u2019s team with NARD at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, Ngige said substantial progress was made in operationalising the insurance scheme.\n\nConsultants Give FG 21-day Ultimatum\n\nMeanwhile, MDCAN has given 21-day ultimatum to the federal government and NSIWC to halt persistent cut in wages of members or face total and indefinite nationwide strike action.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the ultimatum took effect from July 26, 2021.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Jos, Plateau State, the President and Secretary of MDCAN, Professor Ken Ozoilo and Dr. Moses Chingle, respectively, said it was disheartening that consultants teaching in universities across the country have continued to suffer underpayment for over 10 years.\n\nIn the joint statement read by Ozoilo, they said: \u201cThis income loss is the result of the fact that their work in the teaching hospitals is under-compensated, and also the fact that the remuneration system in the university does not recognise them as doctors, despite the fact that the University primarily employs them because of the fact that they are doctors.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Ozoilo said: \u201cThis income loss has led to the increasing difficulty in attracting the brightest and the best of consultants into the university as lecturers, a steady exodus of the few doctors in academia to service centres and a worsening of the brain drain phenomenon.\u201d\n\nHe added that a letter from NSIWC dated, April 23, 2021, with reference number: SWC/S/04/S.410/T/86 to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation had directed the removal of doctors who are lecturers from the CONMESS Salary Scale on the IPPIS platform for the payment of their salaries in the universities, a development he described as unacceptable.\n\nOzoilo said MDCAN had made several efforts to engage various arms and agencies of government with the aim of achieving a negotiated peaceable solution in the past 10 years to no avail.\n\nHe stressed that efforts had been made by some federal universities to ameliorate the income loss by payment of clinical lecturers in those institutions on CONMESS Salary Scale in the university relying on appropriate and relevant circulars issued by government, adding that the letter from NSIWC had directed the removal of the consultants from CONMESS in those few universities is absolutely the last straw.\n\nOzoilo said: \u201cConsequently, MDCAN has resolved to withdraw the services of its members from all public institutions to press home its demand for an appropriate, fair and just compensation for the work of clinical lecturers. NEC therefore, hereby issues a 21-day ultimatum effective from today, Monday, July 26, 2021 to government and its agencies as a notice of its resolve.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe demand immediate withdrawal of the NSIWC letter Ref no: SWC/S/04/S.410/T/86 of 23rd April 2021 directing the removal of doctors from CONMESS on the IPPIS platform in the university.

          "text": "*Propose securitisation of assets as an alternative strategy\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi\n\nNigeria\u2019s leading economists have faulted the 2022-2024 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP), warning that projecting N14.6 trillion within the timeframe is unsustainable.\n\nThe economists, however, tasked the apex government to consider securitisation of its idle assets as an alternative funding strategy rather than pushing the country into a debt trap that might eclipse its future economically.\n\nChief Executive, Economic Associates (EA), Dr. Ayo Teriba; Founder, Centre for Value in Leadership, Prof. Pat Utomi, and a former Deputy Governor, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia canvassed these views in separate interviews with THISDAY yesterday.\n\nUnder the 2022-2024 MTEF and FSP, the federal government had projected to spend an aggregate of N14.6 trillion on debt servicing while it planned a budget of N13.95 trillion in 2022; N15.54 trillion in 2023, and N16.8 trillion in 2024 within the timeframe.\n\nAs shown in the MTEF, the federal government projected to spend N3.6 trillion on debt servicing in 2022, N4.9 trillion in 2023, and N6.1 trillion in 2024, bringing debt service cost to a cumulative of N14.6 trillion.\n\nConcerned about the budget-debt service percentage under the 2022-2024 MTEF and FSP, Teriba lamented that the debt service cost, as projected in the three years, \u201cis higher than both capital expenditure and recurrent spending.\u201d\n\nEA\u2019s chief executive argued that the sustainability of the country\u2019s debt or the burden that the debt would impose on its finances largely depended on how it borrowed.\n\nHe, therefore, said the size of the debt \u201cmatters very little. But the type of debt that we contract matters more. Some types of debt are not sustainable on the one hand. Some types of debt are sustainable on the other hand.\n\n\u201cThere are some types of debts that are not worth contracting and that can make the borrowers worse off. Some types of debt are worth contracting and that can make the borrowers better off. The major weakness in the MTEF that we have identified is that the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s debt is not linked to assets.\u201d\n\nHe blamed governments\u2019 failure to link debt to assets as the reason the country\u2019s debts \u201cis not sustainable. We borrowed, but the borrowing backfired by restricting our ability to spend even the low revenue that compelled us to borrow in the first place.\u201d\n\nTeriba suggested that a better way of borrowing \u201cis to seek to raise debt that does not impose debt service cost on us. That is the significant difference between asset-linked debt and debt that is not linked to assets.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, called for the securitisation of assets, which according to him, centred on an arrangement that allowed the lender to use the assets of the borrowers to generate revenue within an agreed timeframe without debt service cost attached.\n\nThe economist said: \u201cThis is what we call securitisation of assets. It is sustainable because it is of great benefit to the borrower even beyond the cash that you raised. First, I get additional cash to supplement my low revenue.\n\n\u201cSecond, I have put an idle asset into use by authorising the financiers to manage that asset to recover their money and make a profit over the agreed threshold of profit you will be renting it to me. I am not going to repay the principal and you cannot come to me for any interest payment.\n\n\u201cThe governments can come up; line up an idle fund for securitisation and use it to replace our existing unsecuritised debt. We do not have to pay N14.6 trillion we have projected for debt servicing in three years. Nigeria is very rich in assets. But most of these assets are idle. That makes the case for asset securitisation very urgent.\u201d\n\nIn his comprehensive analysis of Nigeria\u2019s debt profile, Utomi described the 2022-2024 MTEF and FSP as unwelcome, noting that it was unexplainable \u201cto be where we are right now in terms of debt profile and the future of the economy.\u201d\n\nHe, also, lamented that the country \u201chas got to a situation of not creating an option for how we can sustain the economy. Rather, we are just waiting for oil proceeds and paying up whatever we have borrowed in the meantime.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, that is a very poor vision of how to grow an economy. What is now evidently happening is that the debt has become unsustainable. Many state and federal governments are spending a substantial share of their revenues on debt servicing. This is not sustainable.\n\nUtomi, however, recommended the strategy of focusing on the supply side, which he said, entailed the production of goods and services and generating a balance of trade from exports that favour Nigeria to bail the country from the debt trap.\n\nHe, rhetorically, asked: \u201cWhat do you produce? How do you produce? We need a strategy for that. In my opinion, the strategy must seriously focus on production and foreign exchange generation that deal with our debt problems. We need to look at something I talk about all the time \u2013 our factor endowment and going into perspective planning.\n\n\u201cWe need a desperate strategy to push us in the direction of producing for exports where we have a comparative advantage or where the economy enjoys a latent comparative advantage,\u201d the professor recommended.\n\nHe, also, challenged the federal government\u2019s strategies \u201cto expand the economy or the economic activities by leveraging our assets to create capitals. Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto made a strong point about poor countries like Nigeria. We have a lot of assets. But those assets are not tangible.\n\n\u201cIt cannot transform so quickly to collateral for example that somebody can use it to get funding for ventures that will expand economic activities. We do not have that representational system in the land registry.\n\n\u201cIn Europe, every piece of land is documented in the land registry and the value is established through the land registry. Every point in time you borrow from a retirement plan, for example, use the money to invest and create new value or wealth. That is how we can grow our economy.\u201d\n\nMailafia, in specific terms, urged the government \u201cto cut back drastically on certain worthless expenditures while keeping a leash on the cost of governance.\n\n\u201cGovernment should also engage with our creditors to restructure our loans to ensure the fiscal space that will enable us to continue to grow while expanding the possibilities of collective welfare.\n\n\u201cThere should be a more rigorous system of accountability for the continuing revenue-generating agencies of government \u2013 Customs, FIRS, NNPC, and others. We hear many gory tales of trillions being lodged in private accounts.\u201d\n\nCBN\u2019s former deputy governor, also, observed that boosting revenue in the present situation would require also ensuring a sound macroeconomic environment and an attractive business eco-system that enables businesses to flourish.\n\nAccording to him, it is only when this happens that the government will be in a position to tax them. Finally, we must learn to live within our means. The current operating cost of the government is way too high. Some many lacunas and gaps facilitate financial leakages and hemorrhages. All these must be rigorously plugged.\n\nIn 2022, under the framework, the federal government put projected expenditure at N13.95 trillion, comprising N3.4 trillion for non-debt expenditure, N3.6 trillion for debt servicing, and N3.61 trillion for the implementation of capital projects.\n\nBy 2023, it increased its total projected spending to N15.54 trillion, with N6.49 trillion allocated for non-debt expenditure, and N3.61 trillion for capital expenditure.\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, is projected to spend N16.8 trillion to finance its budget, with debt servicing gulping N6.1 trillion; recurrent expenditure N6.4 trillion, and capital expenditure standing at N3.61 trillion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, is presently hospitalised in Maryland, the United States, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters further gathered that Tinubu, who has had several medical trips this year alone, had a surgery last week and could be billed for another one over a yet-to-be-disclosed illness.\n\nBola Tinubu\n\nThe APC National Leader has been off official and party functions in the country for a long time, amidst talks that he is being positioned for the 2023 presidency to succeed the incumbent repressive regime of Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cTinubu is hospitalised in Maryland, US. His health is failing. He couldn\u2019t participate in launching his Arewa library, and he couldn\u2019t participate in the Local Government Area elections last week. He could not attend today\u2019s APC congress due to health reasons.\n\n\u201cHe had a surgery last week,\u201d an authoritative source disclosed.\n\nIn January 2021, Tinubu was also reported sick and hospitalised in Paris, France. Tinubu had earlier complained of exhaustion and had travelled out to rest before the news of his collapse gone viral.\n\nHe was flown to Paris for medical attention in the first week of January.\n\nSaharaReporters had on June 15 reported that Tinubu was also in Paris, battling some old age illnesses. See Also Scandal 2023: Tinubu In France For Medical Checkup, His Health Deteriorating Due To Old Age\n\n\u201cTinubu is in Paris, France for a medical checkup. His health is deteriorating. Old age and other stuff, but he still wants to be president. This could mean another medical tourism presidency for our country,\u201d a top source had at that time revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported the conspicuous absence of Tinubu during the one-day working visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to commission various projects in Lagos State.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that the Presidency, against its former custom, refused to extend an invitation to Tinubu ahead of the visit which should make him feel welcome at the ceremony, and the camp of the APC leader felt embarrassed by the Presidency\u2019s decision.\n\nTop sources had also revealed that Tinubu did not feel comfortable to stay in Lagos during the Presidential visit in order to hide the growing battle between the two from public glare and he instead decided to embark on a journey.\n\nEarlier, the President\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, had tried to downplay the obvious rift between the two leaders and their camps, saying the interview the President granted to Arise Interview where he mentioned Lagos was not in reference to Buhari.\n\n\u201cYou cannot sit there in Lagos, for instance, and decide on the fate of APC on zoning,\u201d Buhari had said while responding to a question during the interview.\n\n\u201cThe hope of this administration is to see APC last beyond it. Therefore we should allow the party to decide. The restructuring of the party has begun from the bottom to the top with the membership card registration. Every member of the party must be involved. We will soon conduct our convention. No single member of the party will be allowed to go against the wish of the party.\u201d\n\nShehu had maintained that there was no rift between the two leaders and the reference to Lagos was not to Tinubu.",

          "text": "Five activists arrested at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre for wearing #BuhariMustGo T-shirts by the Department of State Services (DSS) have now spent 28 days in detention as the secret police continue to violate court order on their release.\n\nThe DSS which dragged them before a Magistrates' Court in Mpape last Thursday, also refused to allow them to perfect their bail conditions before hurrying them back into detention.\n\nThe activists namely Ben Mannaseh; Emmanuel Larry; Victor Udoka Anene; a blind Saxophonist, Samuel Gabriel Iwatonaiye and Henry Nwodohave have spent 28 days in illegal detention.\n\nHuman rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, on Sunday reiterated the unjust incarceration of the activists, calling for their immediate release from detention.\n\nSaharaReporters had on Monday reported that Justice Anwuli Chikere of Federal High Court while ruling on the ex parte motion filed ordered the DSS to immediately release the activists from detention. See Also Human Rights BREAKING: Court Orders Nigeria's Secret Police To Immediately Release 5 Activists Illegally Arrested, Detained For Wearing #BuhariMustGo T-Shirts To Dunamis Church\n\nThe DSS was thereafter served the court order by the court bailiff on the same day.\n\nIt had been reported that despite a release order from the Federal High Court, the DSS filed charges at a lower Magistrates' Court in Abuja against the five activists which also granted them bail. See Also Human Rights Nigeria's Secret Police Disobey Abuja Court Order To Immediately Release 5 #BuhariMustGo Activists\n\nSowore stated that the DSS was characteristically known for violating court orders and the lower Magistrates' ought not to have heard the matter brought by the DSS.\n\nHe said, \u201c#FreeDunamis5: On July 4th 2021, five young activists wearing #BuhariMustGo T-shirts attended Dr. Paul Enenche\u2019s Dunamis International Gospel Centre in Abuja, they answered the 'Altar Call,' received Holy Communion and left the church peacefully but the Dunamis church security pounced on them, dragged them down to the church security posted, forcefully took over their phones and deleted the footage showing they attended the church and left.\n\n\u201cThey proceeded to torture them and then invited the most lawless Nigerian secret service also known as 'DSS' to pick them up for indefinite detention. These young activists have been through hell as the DSS denied them access to their lawyers, families and medical care.\n\n\u201cLast week, a federal judge in Abuja ordered their release from detention, unconditionally but characteristically, the DSS decided to disregard the lawful order of the Federal judge.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday the DSS drove them to a lower court, a Magistrates' court to arraign them for \u201cdisorderly conduct.\u201d The Magistrate who ought to have repudiated DSS\u2019s act of impunity disregarded the pleadings of their lawyer that a higher court had granted order for release, instead he ratifies the impunity of the DSS and proceeded to hear the case, and then granted them bail but the DSS couldn\u2019t wait for the bail conditions to be concluded, they quickly drove the 5 Dunamis church victims away after harassing journalists at the court premises.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve refused to released them till date. This is the update regarding the Dunamis 5. Victims of collusion between the state and one of Nigeria\u2019s biggest Pentecostal churches! #RevolutionNow #BuhariMustGo.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Iwatonaiye, a blind saxophonist, one of the detained activists, fell ill in custody and had not been given medical attention. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Blind Saxophonist Arrested In Dunamis Church Falls Sick In Department Of State Services\u2019 Custody, Denied Access To Doctors\n\nThe situation is giving their families and relatives a serious concern.\n\nThe activists through their lawyer had sued the Director-General of the DSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi, the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and the Senior Pastor of the church, Paul Enenche, over their illegal arrest, detention and violation of their rights.\n\nTwo days after the arrest of the worshippers, activists, Sowore and Deji Adeyanju accompanied by their lawyer, Abubakar Marshal, met with the Senior Pastor (Enenche) of the church to demand their release.\n\nThe pastor was said to have confirmed that the arrest was made by DSS and absolved the church of any blame in the entire scenario. He also said he had been in touch with the DSS officials to get the young Nigerians released.\n\nBut unfolding events have shown that the church security officials and Enenche masterminded the arrest and torture of the five activists before handing them over to the DSS.",

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why Nigeria\u2019s central bank is banning forex sales to money changers",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It had also gotten a $100m investment from Mastercard in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) in April.\n\nAMC BV is a subsidiary of Airtel Africa that functions as the holding company for several of the company\u2019s mobile money operations across 14 African countries.\n\nThe mobile money division is one of the largest financial services providers on the continent. It enables users to make mobile payments, international money transfers, borrow money, and use virtual credit cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer TechCrunch, the investment will be used to reduce its debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries.\n\nThe investment deal will be completed in two tranches, with the first $150m probably in August and $50m at a yet unspecified date.\n\nAirtel Africa says that QIA will hold a minority stake in the company while it retains the majority.

However, it surpassed the $83m of Q1 2020 by 38.7%. Its mobile money customer base went from 18.3 million in Q1 2020 to 21.7 million in Q1 2021, an 18.5% increase.\n\nIn February 2021, Airtel Africa made it known that it wanted to sell a minority stake in AMC BV to raise cash and sell off some assets.\n\nIn subsequent months, the telco giant sold off telecommunication towers in Madagascar and Malawi to Helios Towers for $119m and raised $500m from outside investors. And in June, the telco giant announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud, QIA CEO, believes that Airtel Money is critical for economic activity facilitation, particularly for customers who lack access to traditional financial services.\n\nHe also believes that the Sovereign Wealth Fund\u2019s investment in Airtel Africa will contribute to sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s financial inclusion.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, the job of a system administrator \u2014 sometimes called a sysadmin or system admin \u2014 had begun to fascinate me. But before we start, a little back story.\n\nMy first experience with system administrators was with the technical support staff in the ICTU/CRPU unit of the University of Benin. Depending on the mood you catch them in, you could get a good-natured, friendly personality or, a trash-talking grump \u2014 most likely the latter.\n\nFast forward to 2021, my job at Techpoint Africa led me to meet people like Karo, a soft-spoken but highly opinionated sysadmin who takes his job seriously and, quite frankly, knows what he is doing.\n\nThe difference was stark, but I still didn\u2019t know what exactly sysadmins did. And I decided to find out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho are System Administrators?\n\nWhen I first began down the rabbit hole called research, I expected to find a pretty complex maze of confusing terms and techy words. In the end, I did find them \u2014 words like awk, Perl, and shell. I also found semi-familiar words like server, network, and information.\n\nBut I discovered an underlying thread, troubleshooting. At the heart of the job of a system administrator is the ability to find solutions to the IT fires an organisation dependent on technology inevitably needs to put out.\n\nKolade Alonge, a former server administrator at MultiChoice, puts it succinctly, \u201cWe are problem solvers.\u201d\n\nMore than that, System Administrators are responsible for the general management and maintenance of computer systems \u2014 servers, storage, CPU, PC \u2014 including software and hardware.\n\nThey manage user accounts, server configurations, install, configure and update software. Essentially, they keep an organisation from falling apart. System Administrators troubleshoot all day, every day.\n\nFor the average sysadmin, the day is spent attending to tickets \u2014 troubleshooting requests \u2014 from users, checking for errors and making sure the server is running perfectly.\n\nIt is quite demanding, requiring sysadmins to have knowledge of computer architecture \u2014 both hardware and software \u2014 and stay abreast of the latest updates to software; constantly think widely for economical solutions for the organisation while trying to maintain some semblance of calm.\n\nThe path to System Administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fatosa Adigun, his journey began in the four walls of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, as a student in the Electrical/Electronics Engineering Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI started as an intern after my national diploma. Even though I was studying Electrical/Electronics Engineering, I was privileged to do my industrial training in an IT firm somewhere in Ikeja. I was posted to the Network and IT Department. I knew I\u2019d end up in the IT field.\u201d\n\nHis love for IT led him to go back to school for a degree in Computer Science, a programme which will end next year.\n\nAlonge\u2019s path was a different one. He studied Computer Science as an undergraduate and began his career as an IT Auditor, but eventually wound up as a System Administrator at Multichoice for the better part of a year. An experience he believes every IT professional should have.\n\n\u201cEvery auditor needs to have that experience of providing service before auditing service.\u201d\n\nAlonge and Adigun agree on one thing, going to university barely gives you 10% of the knowledge you need on the job. Many skills they acquired were primarily learnt as they went along or via courses and certifications they have had to take.\n\nAccording to Alonge, in Nigeria, school will teach you what you need to understand about computer architecture. If you are lucky enough, you get a lecturer good at programming who teaches well.\n\nWhile entry requirements for system administrators are relatively low, companies often prefer to hire persons with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a computer-related course such as computer science, electrical/electronics engineering, or telecommunications and networking.\n\nHowever, according to Olusegun Balogun, an IT Support Specialist, you don\u2019t necessarily have to have those degrees to become a system administrator.\n\n\u201cAt Southgate Technologies, where I did my IT, I had a boss then. He was a subject matter expert in networking, but his first degree was in sociology. It depends first of all on the passion you have for computers, or it could be the first job you landed, and you decided to build a career in IT.\u201d\n\nReal-life experiences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonge recalls receiving a call from his office informing him that his server room was on fire. Thankfully, this was not the case. The problem was with the cooling equipment. The room was quite hot, and the servers had to be turned off to prevent downtime.\n\nHeat is a sworn nemesis of servers. The ideal temperature for a server room is between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius. You also have to be careful not to keep the server room too cold \u2014 very dicey.\n\nApart from the health of the servers, what concerned him most was the fact that fellow staff members would be unable to work.\n\nHe recalls another incident; the backup solution was not working for the file server \u2014 where organisations store their documents and important information. He would have to update the hard drive, a tricky situation that meant that if he failed, not only would important information be lost, he could lose his job as well.\n\nEventually, everything went off without a hitch, with some prayer backing it along the way. He counts this as both his best and worst experience on the job.\n\nFor System Administrators, a problem solved is a highlight of their day. Adigun\u2019s best experience involved solving a network issue for a very important client, a government parastatal which shall not be named.\n\nHis worst experience was a bad boss at a former workplace. His superior shouted at him for a mistake he had inadvertently committed.\n\nHow important are System Administrators?\n\nAccording to Balogun, as long as an organisation\u2019s system depends on IT infrastructure, sysadmins are important. But he also says it depends on the size of the organisation\n\n\u201cSome organisations have in-house administrators because they can afford to hire them. But there are some organisations that cannot afford to keep those engineers in-house, so they just outsource those roles to big organisations.\n\n\u201cUltimately, all organisations, as long as you have some IT setup, routers, switches, LAN, some servers, definitely you will need a system administrator for maintenance. It now depends on the size of the organisation to know whether you are going to outsource or not,\u201d he concludes\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer GFI Software \u2014 a business-IT essential software provider \u2014 IT admins rarely have enough time, find it challenging to work without impacting users, keep everything running smoothly, and find users unpredictable.\n\nThat post was made in 2014, and if Adigun\u2019s statements are factual, it remains the norm. For him, the job is quite time-consuming. Sometimes, he has had to leave the office at 10 p.m. He also finds dealing with users in other departments stressful and keeping up with updates to the software.\n\nAlonge identifies scenarios where an organisation wastes money to get gadgets that might not be needed or repair systems that can be repaired with a bit of technical know-how.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the gadgets; it\u2019s about the knowledge,\u201d he says.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAs is the natural progression of things, technology has evolved over the years. Many jobs now involve a lot more automation than they did in the last 10, 20 years.\n\nCan AI take over the job of a sysadmin? Experts disagree, at the very least not until AI does not need the input or guidance of a human being.\n\nA Medium post by mindsync explains this quite well, \u201cIn order to use the algorithms effectively, you need the talent of a living person (it\u2019s not enough to just teach the algorithm on a sample, you need to understand the business context, data features, and be able to interpret the results correctly).\u201d\n\nBoth Adigun and Alonge agree with this assessment\n\nSystems Administrators Appreciation Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you are probably wondering. Why are we talking about sysadmins?\n\nToday, Friday, July 30, 2021, is the 22nd annual System Administrator Appreciation Day. Ted Kekatos created it.\n\nKekatos was inspired by an HP magazine ad in which a system administrator is presented with flowers and fruit-baskets by grateful co-workers as thanks for installing new printers \u2014 the same model he had just installed at his workplace.\n\nIt is a day created specifically to appreciate the tireless and sometimes thankless job that sysadmins do, 24 hours a day, 365 \u2014 or six \u2014 a year.\n\nOn the website, it says: \u201cProper observation of SysAdmin Day includes (but is not limited to): cake & ice cream, pizza, cards, gifts, words of gratitude, custom t-shirts celebrating the epic greatness of your SysAdmin, balloons, confetti, did I say gifts?\u201d\n\nSo, to all sysadmins, up at 3 a.m. trying to work out a server downtime issue, or racking your brains, trying to find the answer to a firewall problem, we say thank you.\n\nAnd most of all, we say a big thank you to Muyiwa Matuluko, Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant and Ognenekaro Obrutu, former Technical Product Lead, for putting out our IT fires \u2014 which we may or may not cause ourselves.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

LCM says it applies technological innovations to Africa\u2019s most pressing problems with skilled indigenous and returning world-class African teams.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Wole Odetayo, Idris Ayodeji Bello, Dami Agboola, and Michael Oluwagbemi, the firm partnered with the Africa Leadership Forum to launch Wennovation hub to provide technology support to Africa\u2019s social impact sectors.\n\nHow does LoftyInc get deals? Bello revealed that there are five major sources of deals for the firm. With a strong network at home and in the diaspora, the firm gets access to startups building amazing startups.\n\nHe also disclosed that founders who have been funded frequently refer other founders to them.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Idris Ayodeji Bello, a Managing Partner at the firm to get an insight into the firm\u2019s activities.

Although dyslexia may co-occur with eye and vision conditions, these conditions are unrelated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat then is dyslexia? Dyslexia is a learning disability. Per the International Dyslexia Association, it is a \u201clanguage problem that refers to a cluster of symptoms that result in people having difficulties with specific language skills, particularly reading.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? Caused by a deficiency in the brain\u2019s ability to convert visual or auditory input into comprehensible language, dyslexia impacts reading comprehension and fluency, writing, memory, listening, and executive functioning in the workplace or school.\n\nBesides, dyslexics may struggle with spoken language, even after being exposed to positive language models at home and receiving appropriate language training in school.\n\nThey may have difficulty expressing themselves clearly or fully comprehending what others say. While such language difficulties are difficult to identify, they can cause significant difficulties in education, the workplace, and interpersonal relationships.\n\nHence, the need to adopt tech tools to help them perform better. Last month, we discussed how assistive technology helps people with learning disabilities to unleash their potential.\n\nThis is an excellent time to revisit it: The unique case of Africans with learning disabilities and assistive technology.\n\nMany assistive technologies exist to aid dyslexics with reading, writing, and organising their work or events, but we highlighted four tools that help them succeed academically and professionally.

Google has announced a new policy update on the Android Play Store to support user control, privacy, and security, beginning September 1, 2021.\n\nThe new update prohibits apps focused on \u201ccompensated sexual relationships.\u201d \u201cSugar dating\u201d apps will no longer be allowed on the Android Play Store as part of a series of platform policy changes.\n\nIs the old policy similar? Before announcing the update, Google\u2019s Play Store policies already prohibited apps promoting \u201cservices that could be interpreted as providing sexual acts for a fee.\u201d\n\nHowever, the updated policy includes \u201ccompensated dating or sexual arrangements in which one participant is expected or implied to provide money, gifts, or financial support to another participant.\u201d\n\nWhile Google didn\u2019t announce why the apps are being prohibited on its Store, there has been a significant rise in efforts to prevent sex work in the United States.\n\nSince implementing the FOSTA-SESTA legislation in 2018, the protections granted to online content for the promotion or facilitation of prostitution have been revoked.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with the new update, Google is providing a Developer Preview of app set ID for critical use cases like analytics and fraud prevention. Also, the search giant is adding new restrictions to its Family Policy which is aimed at children.\n\nIt is also adding a new section to its Enforcement Policy that will allow it to close inactive or abandoned developer accounts after one year of inactivity, among other things.\n\nGoogle claims that with its User Data Policy update, it will be illegal to link persistent device identifiers to personal and sensitive user data or resettable device identifiers unless for pre-approved use cases.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nFacebook Gave Investors 10.4 Billion Reasons To Be Happy\u2014But Its Stock Sank Anyways.

          "text": "Over 300 companies trapped in the shutdown of the Eleme-Onne section of the East-West Road area near Port Harcourt, Rivers State, have cried out over bleak weeks ahead.\n\nThis came as a result of the rejection of the offers by the Ministry of Niger Delta headed by ex-governor and ex-senator, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nOgoni youths had occupied the stretch on Tuesday, July 26, 2021, insisting on the repair of the road, but the Ministry sent the permanent secretary to announce a N2.5bn-compensation to property owners to enable construction to start and ordered RCC, the contractor, to move in on Friday to start work.\n\nThe youth did not budge and insisted on seeing the FG or work in action before they would vacate. The stalemate has caused panic within the companies as the youth began making arrangements for church service at the venue on Sunday.\n\nRead also: Wike demands completion of East-West Road\n\nA CEO in one of the multi-national corporations said the delay to address the issue was becoming worrisome to the businesses in the zone. \u201cWe are now afraid because it\u2019s scary,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother source staying away in Lagos to await outcome told BusinessDay on the telephone that the companies have lost man-hours running into hundreds of millions of naira, if not billions yet. \u201cYou have large scale corporations such as two fertilizer manufacturing companies who serve the entire country,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was gathered that farmers are waiting endlessly for their supplies to touch their crops because it is a seasonal application and it cannot wait.\n\nThe only petrochemicals company in the country is there. Trucks are stranded for days, not doing anything and not delivering value. Drivers are running losses. Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited also has a port facility (jetty for export of their products that earn hard currency to the nation). The place is dormant now, sources said.\n\nThe Oil and Gas Free Zone Area (OGFZA) with about 300 companies is now shut down. A huge loss of man-hours is being recorded. The source said: \u201cThis is an economic road that delivers traffic to Ogoni of Rivers State, to Akwa Ibom, and to the Cross River States. Travellers have been cut off from their destinations.\n\n\u201cThe call for attention to this road especially the bridge at Eleme has been ongoing for a long time with promises not kept. This road has been a huge loss to the economy; yet, this is the road that links the country to its huge economic nerves such as the only oil and gas port, light ocean terminal, deep ocean terminal, ports, customs, and many economic installations.\n\n\u201cIt is also the road that links the nation to the construction site of the N120billion Bodo-Bonny Road across the sea. Why is this matter being treated with a lukewarm attitude? The FG ought to consider all these losses and intervene in this deadlock. We hear the Senate proposing a concession action for this road. We say no to this. It would mean taxing people who work in the area going and coming, yet this is the road to the nation\u2019s economic hub,\u201d the CEO lamented on phone.\n\nSome insiders interviewed said the N725.77bn road has not had any serious provision in the budget right from the Olusegun Obasanjo time. They say those thinking that the present Minister of Niger Delta Affairs is implicated in the road project may find out that he is not sitting on any allocation meant for the road.\n\nThey argued that Akpabio is not the Minister of Works but he has rather been fighting to garner N100bn to complete the road. He has often stated that he should be one of those fighting for that road because it leads directly to his hometown. \u201cHe is a stakeholder, too. Besides, he wants to be on record as the minister that fixed that road. So, he has nothing to gain by sabotaging the road,\u201d a source said Friday.\n\nMany wonder why he is just offering N2.5bn to pay compensations to those whose property would soon be demolished to create space for construction to start. He has, however, explained that this is part of the expenditure earmarked for the project. There is N20bn from the Sovereign Wealth Fund that he is said to have wrestled out of those sitting on the fund for four years. He seems to seek more money to make it N100bn and deliver the road as one project.\n\nA source suspected that some conflict entrepreneurs in the communities may have got wind of the construction about to begin and may have felt left out and may have mobilised the youth to begin troubles ahead of works to force attention and be included into negotiations, something that is now common in the oil region.\n\nMeanwhile, more groups are threatening to mobilise more youths to the troubled area. In a statement signed by Ana Hyacinth, SSA Media, to the chairman, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), said: \u201cWe shall be mobilising youths from all communities in the state to Akpabio on Sunday, August 1, 2021, if the FG through the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs continues to pay lip service to the demands of the people.\u201d\n\nShe said they had been part of the ongoing protest and have keenly followed the Federal Government\u2019s \u201cslow and deceitful\u201d response measures to ensure that the demands are swiftly met. \u201cThis is a road with high economic importance to the development of the country and one begins to wonder the rationale behind the payment of lip service to the people\u2019s legitimate demands.\u201d\n\nFinal word\n\nThe leaders of the protests said they will not leave the place until they see work in progress. Leader of Ogoni Youths Federation, Yamaabana Legborsi told newsmen that they did not trust Akpabio\u2019s promise to mobilise contractors to fix the stretch. They said the company said to be ordered to site has not got there. It is not clear if any company would agree to mobilise to such a place under HSE rules.\n\nThe youth have vowed not to vacate the expressway except the contractor moved to the site and the company announces that Federal Government has given it money for the reconstruction of the failed portion of the road.\n\nReacting to Akpabio\u2019s announcement of the N2.5bn, Legborsi said: \u201cWe have received it with mixed feelings. We described it unambiguously as diversionary because the aim of the five-day-old mother of all protests remains on the front burner: which is the demand for the complete reconstruction of the entire stretch of the East-West Road. And that is the end, and we are serious about it.\u201d",

          "text": "New month, new week, new batch of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nThe federal government has said that Nigeria will receive a new batch of 4 million doses of Moderna vaccine, latest by Sunday, August 1, 2021.\n\nThe arrival of the new batch of the vaccine is expected to provide another opportunity for authorities to advance the protection of Nigerians against Covid-19 with the country expected to resume vaccination by next week.\n\nThis disclosure was made by the executive director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, during an interview on the NTA network news on Friday night.\n\nShuaib said that the vaccine would be taken to various storage facilities across the country for immediate deployment for the vaccination exercise.\n\nHe said that the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on Covid-19 had made adequate preparations for the storage and distribution of the vaccine by procuring 60 ultra-cold chain storage facilities across the country.\n\nHe explained that the Modena vaccine, expected to arrive on Sunday, requires ultra-cold temperatures ranging from 25 to 50 degrees Celsius whose storage equipment has been procured and installed.\n\nShuaib pointed out that as soon as the vaccines arrive, vaccination exercises will start by next week, assuring that other vaccines like the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson vaccines will be arriving in the country in September.\n\n\u201cIn Less than 72 hours from now, Nigeria will be receiving four million doses of Modena vaccines from the Covax facility and we are excited that this will be another opportunity for us to advance the protection of Nigerians against COVID-19 virus,\u201d he said.\n\nLagos to start online vehicle licence renewal next week\n\nThe Motor Vehicle Administration Agency (MVAA) has announced that the Lagos State Government will flag off its newly introduced online vehicle licence renewal with effect from August 1, 2021.\n\nThe state government said that the newly introduced vehicle registration portal via https: portal.autoreg.ng is to allow individuals to renew their vehicle licences from the comfort of their homes.\n\nThis disclosure was made by the general manager of MVAA, Lape Kilanko, during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting at Alausa, Ikeja, noting that the concept is part of the agency\u2019s efforts at enhancing service delivery in the area of vehicle documentation in Lagos State.\n\nRead also: Cement companies bounce back from COVID downturn\n\nKilanko explained that the hitherto common practice of visiting MVAA stations before renewal of vehicle licence could be done will soon be a thing of the past, stressing that with the laudable innovation, the vehicle information is secured as only the details supplied by the vehicle owner will be updated on the page.\n\nResident doctors to embark on an indefinite nationwide strike\n\nMedical doctors under the aegis of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) have agreed to commence an indefinite strike across the country with effect from Monday, August 2.\n\nThis action which is coming at a very critical time when the country is currently experiencing a rise in Covid-19 infections follows a directive issued on Saturday at the end of the executive meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) of the union held in Umuahia, the Abia State capital.\n\nThis disclosure was made by the National President of NARD, Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, while briefing the press after the meeting, saying that members have been asked to proceed on a nationwide indefinite industrial action.\n\nFG to invest $200 million on pharmaceutical infrastructure\n\nThe managing director and chief executive officer of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Uche Orji has announced plans by the Federal Government to invest $200 million in pharmaceutical infrastructure.\n\nThe funds are expected to be used to execute 20 projects in the health sector under the Federal Government\u2019s Health Intervention Initiative.\n\nThis disclosure was made by Orji during a weekly briefing on Thursday, July 29, 2021, in Abuja.\n\nOrji said that some of the pharmaceutical infrastructure to be embarked upon with this fund includes the manufacture of essential drugs, vaccines, and the construction of cancer centres in the nation\u2019s health care sector.\n\nThe successful implementation of this initiative would help the country drastically reduce its dependence on foreign supplies.\n\nBullish sentiments favour the oil sector\n\nOil prices fell by nearly $1 on Monday as concerns about fuel demand from the spread of COVID-19 variants, as well as floods in China, offset expectations of tight supplies through the rest of the year.\n\nIndia has announced a move to commercialise its strategic crude oil reserves which is a sign the major Asian importer is taking steps to mitigate the high prices caused by OPEC+\u2019s output cuts.\n\nThe United States government says it is considering a ban on Chinese imports of Iranian crude as it is increasingly clear that Chinese firms are the central players in the supply of Iranian oil and reaching a deal with Iran before the inauguration of its new government is unlikely.\n\nOil prices recorded little change on Friday and headed for a weekly gain as demand grew faster than supply, while vaccinations are still expected to alleviate the impact of a resurgence in COVID-19 infections across the globe. Brent had a weekly growth of 3.3%.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be bullish on expectations of tighter supplies through 2021 as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis.\n\nCurrency market\n\nThe currency market was chaotic last week following the CBN\u2019s governor\u2019s pronouncement that the Regulator stopped the sale of FX to BDC operators at the end of the two-day MPC meeting held last week.\n\nThe Naira depreciated at the BDC market while it appreciated marginally at the I & E FX window on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis.\n\nAgainst the US dollar at the BDC it closed at US$1/N525 depreciating by -5.00%, against the British pound it also depreciated by -1.42% to close at \u00a31/N715, and against the Euro by -1.34% to close at \u20ac1/N603.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira appreciated W-o-W by +0.05% and dipped by -0.02% at the NAFEX window.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N411.44 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.19.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney market\n\nInterbank rates fell sharply for most of the week, as over N530bn inflow from repo and primary market strengthened system liquidity.\n\nAt the close of the trading session on Friday, funding rates dipped. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 7.50% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 7.75% indicating a W-o-W fall of -72.73% for OBB and -73.04% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury bills market\n\nThe treasury bills market was largely bullish for most of the trading session last week, as we saw some buying in the week.\n\nAt the close of the market last week, average benchmark yields for T-bills declined by -14.56% to 5.90% while OMO bills inched up by +1.38% W-o-W to close at 8.69%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill fell by -1.44% to close at 8.23%.\n\nActivity next week is expected to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and eurobond market\n\nThe Bond market sustained its bullish trend last week as positive sentiment was seen across the board. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.25% for the week which fell W-o-W by -3.85%.\n\nThere was a huge sell-off of Chinese investment as a result of the crackdown by the regulators on monopolistic tendencies of tech companies in China. This sent negative sentiment to investors in emerging and frontier economies. At the close of trading last week, average benchmark yields rose by +0.38% to close at 5.56% on a W-o-W basis.\n\nWe expect the relatively quiet trend to persist in the near term.\n\nThe Nigerian capital market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the week on a negative note as the Bears dominated the market. The NGXASI closed the week with a decline of -0.31%.\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange lost N62.95bn, year-to-date return moderated to -4.28%, while the market capitalization settled at N20.08trn. The volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange this week advanced by +48.92% and +92.53% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was broadly negative last week as the NGX Mainboard was the highest loser for the week with -2.59% while NGX Oil and Gas recorded the highest gain with +3.84%. NGX IND, NGX-30, NGX Consumer Goods, and NGX Banking closed the week with -1.32%, -0.60%, +0.06%, and -0.95% respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed positive with 37 gainers led by OANDO and BOCGAS as against 35 losers led by LINKASSURE and REGALINS\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of the result season. However, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments are also likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.",

          "text": "With the arrival, a few days ago, of six Super Tucano jet fighters, Nigeria is set to put to rout the assorted terrorist groups in the country, but experts say Nigeria needs the political will and attitudinal change in order to win the low-grade war.\n\nConsidering the might of the Nigerian Army, especially at defending the West African region from internal aggressions amid commendable peace missions, one would have thought that by now, the Boko Haram terrorists, bandits and kidnappers should have been wiped out outright.\n\nRather, the notorious groups are thriving, expanding their territories, killing innocent people and destroying properties. Moreover, the difficulty in tackling these criminal elements and terrorists by the once-revered Nigerian Army is surprising to many, especially those who witnessed the military prowess of the army at the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, Bakassi, and some other international engagements.\n\nThe Nigerian government, which has shown little will power to tackle the country\u2019s security challenges, is at it again.\n\nRead Also: Security: Six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft leave US for Nigeria\n\nIt is celebrating the acquisition of six Super Tucano jets, which arrived Nigeria penultimate Thursday, and some people are commending the government, expressing the optimism that with the military jets, the days of Boko Haram, bandits and kidnappers are numbered.\n\nBut some keen observers think otherwise.\n\nTerfa Gekwe, a retired military personnel, from Benue State, explained that it is not about the ammunition, but soldiers in the right spirit to fight, smooth logistics, better welfare for families of slain soldiers and willingness to share intelligence by all security operatives and communities where the wars are raging.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian-made Super Tucano turboprop light-attack aircraft can only achieve result when the pilots are not ambushed, when right security intelligence is shared and secured, and morale needs to be very high for the pilots to hit the right targets because families of the dead colleagues are suffering today,\u201d Gekwe explained.\n\n\u2018Change of attitude is what Nigeria needs\u2019\n\nThe retired security personnel, who runs a security firm for luxury estates in Abuja, insisted that Nigeria does not need all the sophisticated weapons to win the war, but internal purging of the system to fish out saboteurs of military efforts, apologists and financiers of terrorist groups in the country and better collaborations with locals.\n\n\u201cYou need to show example by freezing accounts of suspected financiers, make open show of the killing of captured terrorists and forget the idea of repentant Boko Haram, if they cannot lead the way to the group\u2019s hideout, then they are still working together. Do you ever think terrorists will let a member go. The solution lies in government\u2019s hand and it knows it,\u201d he further said.\n\nToeing the same line, Amedu Tyem, a Plateau State-born serving senior security officer, regretted that the Nigerian government is announcing acquisition of jet fighters, which should have been secret, because \u201cyour enemy should not know your strength if you must win him,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe queries the source of the ammunition terrorists are using in shooting down military jets and that the government and the Nigerian Army should have tackled this challenge before acquiring jets that could be shot down soon by the waiting terrorists.\n\n\u201cI am a trained security officer and I know the kind of gun that will shoot down a fast jet. Such guns are not in the market, they are classified and can only be acquired by security institutions, so where did the guns come from, or are they saying it is Niger Delta when all the borders in the north are open to Niger, Mali, Chad and Libya by extension,\u201d Tyem noted.\n\nAs well, Peter Ogah, an activist and forensic lawyer, argued that buying jets when government is more than willing to negotiate with bandits makes no sense, rather the government should not have made noise about the jets, but bring them in secretly, use them to strike bandits and terrorists persistently until they all die or run away with their sponsors.\n\n\u201cIt is very disappointing that terrorists will shoot down military jet and nothing happens to them. The government is not telling us the truth, who are they, where did they get such guns, how did they know when to target and shoot right. If the government gets serious and sincere with the fight, it will force the Army to bring expected result. Which African country will want Nigerian soldiers now, when it is obvious that they cannot fight their own battle? Government should task the Army,\u201d Ogah said.\n\nOgah also thinks that the government should have insisted on getting foreign help rather than wasting lean resources on jet fighters that would be shot down soon by the so-called technically defeated terrorists.\n\n\u201cIf we engage the United States of America or even France as foreign partners in the fight against terrorism, they will come with their personnel and equipment as well, including jets. Who is advising Nigeria and why are we always taking the easy road?\u201d Ogah lamented.\n\nFor Ogah, the Nigerian government should be sued for the lives lost during the #EndSARS protest because trigger-happy soldiers should use the same passion in shooting innocent protesters to attack terrorists and bandits.\n\nAlso, considering the billions spent so far on security with little or no results, Marcus Angwe, a political scientist and newspaper public affairs analyst, thinks that security is now a money-making venture and that somebody is getting richer with the six Super Tucano jets deal.\n\n\u201cDo you think the six jets would have been possible if no jet was shot down? I see collaborations among a network of wicked people who want to live on the blood of innocent Nigerians. It is only in wars you shoot down jets because of the big guns required, what if it is a mercenary jet that shot down our own jet? We all need to wake up, we need to task government; we need to protest to the Army on why they are chickening-out,\u201d Angwe said.\n\nToeing a different line however, Gerald Mburi, a novelist and documenter of civil unrests in Africa in the last five decades, fears that the jets might be for military operations in the South East of the country, following Army threats in recent times.\n\n\u201cIn my three researches on civil unrest in Nigeria, I have discovered some dominant factors, which are huge challenge to security and one of them is the partiality in handling insecurity across the country. You cannot say a group is terrorist, another cultural group, and the other gunmen, and achieve same result. If those flying the new jets are Boko Haram or bandits\u2019 apologists, we will achieve no result. We need soldiers whose mission is to avenge the blood of innocent Nigerians killed directly or indirectly by these terrorists, to launch the attacks\u201d, Mburi said.\n\nThe novelist, who is also a security consultant due to his extensive documentations on insecurity, noted that the rate at which soldiers are absconding from battlegrounds with the terrorists is alarming and pointer to the need for reorientation and purging of the military.\n\n\u201cFrom experience, it is not just weapons that fight wars, but the soldiers handling the weapons are the most important and you need them to be 100 percent across board, else they will drop the weapons. Like they say, \u2018who wan die'\u201d, he enthused.\n\nIn their conclusion, many concerned Nigerians and security observers are insisting on boosting the morale of soldiers, sharing intelligence and collaboration among security operatives, working with communities affected, freezing accounts of financiers of terrorists, non-negotiation with them, making open show of their execution will save the country and not buying all the weapons that saboteurs will take to the enemies.\n\n\u201cBoost soldiers\u2019 morale now, before giving them weapons as financiers are doing to their recruit terrorists and they are getting results,\u201d Gekwe concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s a game-changer in the counter insurgency war \u2013 BMO\n\nThe Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has expressed the optimism that the arrival of the turboprop A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets which it described as \u201ca light attack aircraft, a versatile tool, rugged, well-armoured and available with the state-of-the-art avionics, was a game-changer.\n\nThe group says the new acquisition will further enable surgical strikes at the heart of various counterinsurgency operations by the troops of the gallant Armed Forces of Nigerian (AFN).\n\nIn a statement signed by its chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and secretary, Cassidy Madueke, BMO posited that these air assets would add impetus and renewed vigor to the fierce counterinsurgency operations in the North-East and the fringes of Lake Chad region, including the battle to eliminate bandits in the North-West.\n\n\u201cThe propeller-driven warplanes, which include munitions, spare parts and a maintenance package is tailored for counterinsurgency operations and will greatly bolster the nation\u2019s efforts to combat and efficiently degrade the terrorists and other sundry elements.\n\n\u201cBMO makes bold to note that, no African country has the Super Tucano in its inventory and the government of President Muhammadu Buhari would not relent in its effort to degrade all the agents of destruction in the country while retooling the Nigerian security services,\u201d the group said.\n\nBMO also highlighted how the Buhari administration has been upgrading the airpower of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) in the past six years, emphasising that, \u201cThis is a major milestone, a huge stride in the fight against terrorism. It is historical that since the civil war, Nigeria has not experienced a concise planning and acquisition of this amount of air assets which shall enable a swift termination of this prolonged asymmetric warfare.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cWe are optimistic that these new birds would complement the strategic onslaught against the terrorist elements by members of the AFN and orchestrate a narrative of success in their favour. The AFN is being repositioned as a formidable force of stability, not just in the Lake Chad region, but the greater Sahel.\u201d\n\nBMO further said: \u201cThe Super Tucano\u2019s value for improved targeting capabilities and lessened risk of collateral damage makes it a game-changer in the decade long warfare. It would ensure Nigeria continues with her willingness to lead in combating regional threats to peace and security in the sub region and the continent at large.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the procurement of these strategic platforms would lend a lot of effective air assets in the operational context of the knockdown of the terrorists\u2019 logistics hideouts. We believe the NAF would be providing close air support to the ground troops as they embark on a merciless counteroffensive strike on the Boko Haram/ ISWAP elements in the restive North East.\u201d\n\nToo early to say they are game-changers \u2013 Rtd Captain\n\nSpeaking to BusinessDay Sunday on the benefit of the Super Tucano, Aliyu Umar Babangida, a retired Army captain, said: \u201cCertainly the Air Force adding the aircraft to her inventory grants her some very significant leverage in the operations\u2026and that\u2019s the force multiplier aspect.\n\n\u201cHow, the aircraft are deployed and their impact on the North East operations is where we will begin to say if they are indeed \u2018game changers\u2019 or not. Only events as they unfold, can underscore our expectations\u2026\u201d\n\nThe retired captain further said, \u201cI am confident that within the next 90 days, a Gap analysis of the Super Tucano, and its deployment by the Air Force should indicate if they are game changers or not. And do not forget the adversary; be they insurgents or bandits, are not sleeping.\u201d\n\nOn the allegation that the major problem with the fight against insurgency is the very attitude of the soldiers themselves, particularly, the allegation of fifth-columnists and those who have turned the security challenge into money-making venture, Aliyu Babangida said that he had always maintained that humans, regardless (be they soldiers or not) are social in nature and creatures of habit.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian soldier is no less Nigerian than any citizen in Nigeria. It is thus, amazing that given the miasma of sleaze and financial heist and misappropriation we see daily; given the propensity of persons in this country to abuse our national currency openly\u2026to the rather primitive stage of littering our nations legal tender on the floor while threading on it\u2026 given these rather infantile and sybaritic appetite for primitive accumulation among Nigerians (the leaders and the led), it is indeed amazing that such a nation and the citizenry actually demand discipline and stoic dedication from her soldiers, that such soldiers should actually fight and die hard, while those they fight and die for party hard and recklessly?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cExemplary leadership, responsible citizenry also influence the values and priorities of our soldiers on the battle field.\n\n\u201cIf humans be social beings and creatures of habit, the soldier is no less, and will eventually mirror the finer dynamics of his environment, and its nuances, and that will include doing as his leaders do.\n\n\u201cTo put it succinctly, we must not engage in squander mania while expecting fellow humans or citizens or soldiers to live and die, fighting in the midst of lavish and stupendous show of ostentation, by citizens, private and public.\u201d\n\nOn the allegation that the Presidency may be complicit in the gale of insecurity sweeping through the country, the retired soldier, who also fought in the ECOMOG wars, said: \u201cThe president, presidency, and government cannot offer what they have not to give.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPut another way. An aggregate evaluation of the President and his team is directly proportional to and cannot be divorced from whatever is tenable and trending in Nigeria today.\n\nA president can only be as good as his cabinet, who are in turn, as good as their feats and achievement.\u201d\n\nJourney towards the acquisition\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Thursday, July 22, 2021 took delivery of the first batch of six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft from the United States.\n\nThe director of public relations and information, NAF Headquarters, Edward Gabkwet, an air commodore, announced the development in a statement in Abuja.\n\nApart from the Tucano fighter jets, Nigeria is also said to be expecting other fighter jets from Pakistan.\n\nAfter extensive discussions with the U.S. government, President Muhammadu Buhari in April 2018 placed an order for the aircraft.\n\nHe had said the procurement would help strengthen Nigeria\u2019s national security, as well as a timely end to the Boko Haram war.\n\nIn a letter he wrote to the National Assembly, the president said the Nigerian government transferred $469.4 million to the U.S. government for the purchase.\n\nFor years, Nigeria has engaged in a low-grade war with Islamist sect, Boko Haram. The security challenged has over the last five years worsened with the bloody campaign of various categories of terrorists across Nigeria, mainly, the northern part of the country.\n\nStakeholders in the security sector of Nigeria have continued to emphasise that the country lacked the 21st century equipment to prosecute successful war against the terrorists, who have since resorted to shooting down the nation\u2019s military aircraft.",

We travelled from London to Austria until the day I was arrested. I was on official duty to Berlin on the same issue. I was invited by the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar. We created a lot of awareness as well.\u201d\n\nNoting that he committed his time while he was a commissioner to the pursuit of the return of the art pieces, he said, \u201cIn 2018, the Edo Festival for Arts and Culture codenamed EDOFEST was organized by the Edo State Government. We did a photo exhibition of the stolen artefacts with locations in Europe and America. This exhibition was also done in the palace of His Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin and to showcase the affected artefacts to the world.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of meetings on our own part as the government and other individuals were creating a lot of awareness for people to know that these artefacts have to be returned.\n\nThe feedback from the EDOFEST we did was very good. We wanted to put more pressure on the Europeans and Americans that those artefacts needed to be returned.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cDurikng the exhibitions, we had a lot of visitors. It coincided with the Oba\u2019s anniversary, and a lot of visitors who came were at the exhibition hall to look at the artefacts. And we have feedback as well that people who visit those museums where they are at the moment would always identify them as artefacts from the Benin kingdom which should be repatriated.\u201d\n\nHe noted that there is a lot of work to be done and Governor Godwin Obaseki has continued to pursue the struggle because he is an ardent believer and lover of Edo culture and tourism.\n\n...",

          "text": "Amidst the imminent third wave of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent outbreak of cholera in more than 13 states of the federation, Nigerian doctors have announced the commencement of a nationwide industrial action from Monday, August 2.\n\nThe doctors, members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), blamed the Nigerian government for the strike. They accused the government of failing to implement the Memorandum of Action (MOA) earlier endorsed by the two parties which necessitated the suspension of the NARD\u2019s earlier strike action in April 2021.\n\nThe NARD president, Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, confirmed the development in a communique issued at the end of the association\u2019s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting, which was held in Abia State on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe NEC unanimously resolved by vote to resume the total and indefinite strike action from 08.00hrs Monday, 2nd August, 2021,\u201d the communique reads in part.\n\nThe doctors had earlier in June issued a strike notice to the federal government but the minister of labour and employment, Chris Ngige, insisted on the withdrawal of the notice describing it as \u201carm twisting.\u201d\n\nAbout NARD\n\nThe body is an association of resident doctors, who are undergoing training to become consultants in various fields of medicine.\n\nThey are described as residents because by virtue of their training, they are expected to be available in the hospitals with their patients every day.\n\nThey make up the largest percentage of public medical practitioners in Nigeria and they are closer to the patients in terms of the management of cases.\n\nThey report to their consultants and trainers who access them regularly and grade their performances.\n\nReasons for strike\n\nThe doctors\u2019 grievances are said to be related to the failure of the federal government to implement the contents of the Memorandum of Action (MOA) endorsed before the suspension of the association\u2019s industrial action earlier in April, 2021.\n\nThe doctors had embarked on strike on April 1 after a meeting with a government delegation on March 31 ended in a deadlock.\n\nThe association later suspended the strike on April 10, following the signing of a new agreement with the government, concerning issues raised in a 13-point demand.\n\nThe doctors had demanded, amongst other things, the immediate payment of COVID-19 inducement allowance to some of their members in federal and state tertiary institutions.\n\nThey also demanded the review of hazard allowance for health workers due to the risk associated with their profession.\n\nThe association also decried the undue hardship its members on GIFMIS platform are facing due to the delays in payment of their salaries ranging from three to seven months.\n\nBut almost four months later, the doctors said the government has failed to meet their demands.\n\n\u201cNEC noted the suspension of the total indefinite strike action one hundred and thirteen (113) days ago due to Government promises as entailed in the Memorandum of Actions (MOA) signed at the instance of the Minister of Labour, Sen. Dr Chris Ngige.\n\n\u201cThe NEC also noted the efforts of the Hon Speaker of the House of Representatives in ensuring that the Medical Residency Training Funds is captured in the supplementary budget.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey however frowned at the delay by the Federal Government in disbursing the funds to our members,\u201d the communique made available to PREMIUM TIMES indicates.\n\nThe communique also read in parts; \u201cThe NEC noted that despite Government promise to migrate her members from the GIFMIS to the IPPIS platform, they are still stuck on the GIFMIS platform which is laced with payment irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe NEC noted with grievous concerns the circular from the Head of Service of the Federation removing House Officers from the scheme of service and the consequent implementation by the Lagos State Government.\u201d\n\nThe association also claims that some house officers, who are fresh graduates from medical schools, are still owed between one to two months salaries, and that \u201cthe NEC noted that \u2018bench fee\u2019 for outside postings by Resident Doctors has been abolished, however some Chief Medical Directors have renamed the bench fee as training fee causing hardship for our members.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEC noted that with regards to the non-payment of the National Minimum Wage Consequential Adjustment, the list of affected institutions and personnel strength had since been submitted to the Federal Ministry of Health as directed by the MOA signed with the Federal Government, yet nothing has been done,\u201d the communique added.\n\nThe association also lamented the acute manpower shortage in most tertiary health institutions and the attendant burnout effects on its members.\n\nIt noted that this situation is made worse by the ongoing brain drain decimating the nation\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nPoor welfare\n\nDespite risks associated with their profession, there have been numerous complaints of poor remuneration and welfare of health workers in Nigeria.\n\nThe doctors had downed tools several times over these same issues.\n\nHazard pay, a wage supplement paid to workers who do dangerous jobs, has been the grouse of Nigerian health workers since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHealth workers, being the first respondents to patients, have continued to be at risk of exposure to infections including the COVID-19 virus.\n\nMany health workers have already lost their lives to the infection, according to the chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), FCT, chapter Enema Amodu.\n\nThe Nigerian government had in April 2020 promised a special COVID-19 hazard and inducement allowance of 50 per cent of Consolidated Basic Salary to health workers in Nigerian teaching hospitals, federal medical centres (FMCs), and designated COVID-19 centres for the first three months.\n\n\u201cThe NEC observed with serious concerns that despite several meetings with the presidential committee on salaries and other top government stakeholders on the review of hazard allowance for health workers, the hazard allowance still remains a paltry sum of five thousand naira,\u201d the association said.\n\nIt also said that although efforts have been made about the payment of death in service insurance benefit to the next of kin of its members, more can still be done.\n\nStrike to compound Nigeria\u2019s woes\n\nIf it eventually kicks off as planned, the strike action will further compound the woes bedevilling the nation\u2019s healthcare sector.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s strike is coming at a time Africa\u2019s most populous nation is preparing for a possible third wave of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNigeria has continued to witness a consistent increase in the number of cases and deaths from the disease, including the dangerous \u201cDelta variant\u201d which is already present in many parts of the country.\n\nReports of cholera outbreaks in various states including Bauchi, Enugu, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Plateau, Benue, Bayelsa, Delta, among others, have already added to the pressure on the nation\u2019s health facilities.",

          "text": "A report from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has shown that a total loss of N104.3bn was recorded by Nigeria\u2019s refineries in 13 months, even as the facilities refined no crude oil throughout the period.\n\nAn analysis of the updated consolidated refinery financial performance from February 2020 to February 2021 showed that the plants maintained losses monthly.\n\nThe NNPC manages Nigeria\u2019s refineries, namely Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company, Port Harcourt Refining Company and Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company.\n\nFigures from the corporation showed that the monthly operating expenditures of the refineries surpassed their revenues all through the 13-month duration.\n\nIn February, March, April, May, June, July and August 2020, the consolidated losses of the refineries were N9.36bn, N10.3bn, N9.69bn, N9.55bn, N10.23bn, N9.1bn and N7.1bn respectively.\n\nIn September, October, November and December 2020, the facilities posted cumulative losses of N7.04bn, N5.49bn, N5.99bn and N8.28bn respectively.\n\nTheir consolidated losses continued in 2021, as they lost N5.37bn and N6.88bn in January and February this year, being the most recent update from the corporation.\n\nThis came as the oil firm\u2019s latest report further showed that all through these months, the refineries were unable to refine crude oil.\n\nProviding an explanation for this, it said, \u201cIn February 2021, the three refineries processed no crude and combined yield efficiency is 0.00 per cent owing largely to ongoing rehabilitation works in the refineries.\n\n\u201cThe declining operational performance is attributable to ongoing revamping of the refineries, which is expected to further enhance capacity utilisation once completed.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC further explained that it had been adopting a merchant plant refineries business model since January 2017.\n\nIt said the model took cognisance of the products worth and crude costs, as it noted that the combined value of output by the three refineries (at import parity price) for the February 2021 amounted to approximately N0.10bn.\n\nIt added that there was no associated crude plus freight cost for the three refineries in February 2021 since there was no production, but observed that operational expenses amounted to N6.98bn.\n\n\u201cThis resulted to an operating deficit of N6.88bn,\u201d the oil firm said.\n\nThe Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, NNPC, Kennie Obateru, recently said the $1.5bn rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refining Company had commenced in full and part of the facility would start delivering refined products by September next year, PUNCH reported.\n\nHe told PUNCH that the entire rehabilitation programme would be over in 44 months, stressing that the contractor had already mobilised to site.\n\nThe NNPC officially signed the contract with Tecnimont SPA for the $1.5bn rehabilitation programme of PHRC on April 6, 2021, and parties in the agreement announced the commencement of the project.\n\n\u201cIt (Port Harcourt refinery) will be completed within 18 to 44 months when counting from April this year. By 18 months some part of the refinery will be producing,\u201d Obateru said.\n\nAlso, oil marketers had urged the corporation to try and hasten the rehabilitation exercise of refineries, particularly the revamp of the Port Harcourt refinery.\n\nThe President, Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria, Billy Gillis-Harry, said, \u201cIf the refinery in Port Harcourt can be rehabilitated and it works and comes on stream in a swift manner, that will be a welcome idea.\u201d\n\nHe said it was high time the country started refining crude oil, as this would not only create employment but would impact positively on the overall economy of Nigeria.",

          "text": "Telecom giant, MTN Nigeria, has declared revenue of N790.3 billion, representing an increase of 24.1 per cent in its unedited half year results for the period that ended on June 30, 2021.\n\nAccording to results released yesterday, the company\u2019s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA), grew by 27.6 per cent to reach N417.2 billion. The EBITDA margin improved by 1.4 percentage points to 52.7 per cent and its Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) was up by 39.1 per cent to reach N186.4 billion.\n\nIts dividend per share rose to N4.55 kobo, which is about 30 per cent increase.\n\nMTN, however, suffered losses in the number of mobile subscribers and data subscriptions, as mobile subscribers declined by 7.6 million to 68.9 million, impacted by the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations.\n\nActive data users also declined by approximately 52,000 to 32.5 million.\n\nGiving details of the telecoms company\u2019s operational review for the half year, MTN Nigeria CEO, Mr. Karl Toriola said: \u201cService revenue grew by 24.1 per cent, Year-on-Year (YoY), driven by the sustained growth in data and also partly due to the lower base in comparative 2020 voice revenue that resulted from lockdowns during that period.\n\n\u201cVoice revenue grew by 13.1 per cent, benefitting from an 11.8 per cent increase in traffic and our customer value management (CVM) initiatives. The impact on voice revenue from the industry-wide suspension of new SIM registration was partly offset by higher usage in our active SIM base as well as migration to a higher quality of experience.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cData revenue continued the positive momentum from H2 2020, rising by 48.3 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe said this was driven by increased usage from the existing base, supported by the acceleration in our 4G rollout and enhanced network capacity following the acquisition and activation of additional 800MHz spectrum in Q1.\n\nThe results showed that data traffic rose by 83.0 per cent YoY, while smartphone penetration was up by 5.8pp to 49.3 per cent.\n\n\u201cOur 4G network now covers 65.1 per cent of the population, up from 60.1 per cent in December 2020,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said fintech revenue rose by 48.2 per cent driven by increased adoption of Xtratime and the core fintech services.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expand our MoMo agent network and broaden our service offerings. Our registered MoMo agents increased by 121,000 in H1 2021 to more than 515,000,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting further on the results, Toriola said: \u201cIn the first half of 2021, we made good progress strengthening the resilience of the business, managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and enhancing support to our people, customers and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe extended our commitment to the Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) with an additional N3 billion contribution over a two-year period, half of which has already been paid. This is in support of efforts to promote the health and security of Nigerians, as we navigate our way through the pandemic, and in line with our Y\u2019ello Hope initiatives through which we provided support to our broad base of stakeholders to the value of approximately N25 billion in 2020.\n\n\u201cOur progress towards achieving greater business resilience is reflected in the upgrade by Global Credit Ratings (GCR) of our national scale long-term issuer rating to AAA and affirmation of our national scale short-term rating of A1+ with a stable outlook. This puts MTN Nigeria on the highest possible GCR scale for short-term and long-term ratings, providing a solid platform for growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, 2021 would mark the 20th anniversary of MTN\u2019s presence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate this milestone, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved our participation in the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit (RITC) Scheme. This is in response to government\u2019s drive towards public-private partnerships in the rehabilitation of critical road infrastructure in Nigeria. We intend to participate in the restoration and refurbishment of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway. Conversations in this regard have already commenced, and further announcements will be made in due course,\u201d Toriola explained.\n\n\u201cIn line with our desire to plant deeper and more permanent roots in Nigeria, we have also initiated plans to commission a purpose-built, state of the art MTN Head Office, designed to act as a central hub for our network, a catalyst for creativity and innovation, and a showcase for the flexible working structures that are driving efficiency gains in this new normal working environment.\n\n\u201cAligned with our wider commitment to environmental sustainability, it will meet the highest global environmental standards, demonstrating the role of green technology in our future,\u201d Toriola added.\n\nHe promised that MTN would continue to invest in improved world class services and its network, accelerating the expansion of its 4G coverage and providing home broadband.\n\n\u201cAs part of our rural connectivity programme, we plan to connect approximately 1,000 rural communities to our network this year with an additional 2,000 communities in 2022. We are delighted that these are translating into strong operational performance in line with the objectives of Ambition 2025. In the next three years, we will invest over N600 billion to expand broadband access across the country in support of the government\u2019s broadband plan,\u201d Toriola explained.",

No. CIR/HOS/\u201921/Col.1/052, read: \u201cAs part of the resolutions reached at the 42nd National Council on Establishments Meeting, which was held in Lagos on Monday, 30th November \u2013 Friday, 4th December, 2020, the current status of the Internship Programmes/Housemanship/NYSC Doctors in the Public Service was reviewed and removed from the Schemes of Service as posts attracting Grade Levels in the Salary Structure as the programmes form part of the training in their respective professions.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Mr Governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, has approved the removal of Grade Level for Internship Programmes/Housemanship/NYSC doctors in the State Public Service.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Accounting Officers are enjoined to note the contents of this circular and give it the deserved service-wide publicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NEC noted with grievous concerns the circular from the Head of Service of the Federation removing House Officers from the scheme of service and the consequent implementation by the Lagos State Government. They also observed that some house officers are still being owed one to two months salaries.\n\n\u201cAfter critical appraisal of the performance of both federal and state governments on all the issues affecting the welfare of our members as observed above and the insincerity of government in implementing the memorandum of action after 113 days, the NEC unanimously resolved by vote to resume the total and indefinite strike action from 0800hrs Monday, 2nd August, 2021.\u201d\n\nCriticising the governor for his action, the NARD President in Lagos, Dr Hassan Oluwafemi, said Sanwo-Olu rushed to implement the directive to remove the lower level medical doctors from schemes of service, in spite of it being put on hold by the Federal Government.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe Federal Government has not implemented it yet because at the last meeting of the NMA with the Head of Service of the Federation, it was pointed out that in that memo, we have five to 10 per cent (enrolled on the National Health insurance Scheme) and it is going to destabilise the health sector.\n\n\u201cI guess that was the reason the Federal Government had to put it on hold. But surprisingly, Lagos State quickly jumped to the implementation of that and we feel it is not acceptable. This is something that even the Federal Government has not implemented. Why is it the one that will have a negative effect on doctors that it will be the first to implement?\n\n\u201cCommencing on Monday, the NARD is embarking on an indefinite strike. One of the issues that led to the strike is the house officers and NYSC doctors being removed from the schemes of service by the memo issued by the Federal Government. Other governors have not implemented it, but Lagos State rushed to implement it. If it succeeds in Lagos, definitely some other states will follow suit.\u201d",

Godswill Akpabio, has appealed to indigenes of host communities at the Eleme and Onne axis of the East-West road in Rivers State, to support ongoing efforts of the government aimed at completing the road project as scheduled.\n\nThe minister made this call during his meeting with Stakeholders and Management of Reynold Construction Company, RCC in his office, on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nAkpabio noted that the Federal Government has not abandoned the road as being insinuated in some quarters, explaining that the ministry has been working with the construction company in charge of the road project and has gotten an assurance that the 338KM project will be delivered by 2022.\n\n\u201cThe road, particularly the Eleme Junction and the Onne Port junction area is in a deplorable state, noting that the road when it was first awarded in 2006, was still in very good shape and was therefore excluded from the original contract, however, 15 years after that section has gone bad.\n\n\u201cWe have had some apotheosis that has come up within the road corridor, which was not in the original plan, for instance, the Ministry of Power has built a major power Sub-Station by the Eleme junction, and a lot of other structures have also come on board while a section of the bridge at Aleto also collapsed due to erosion at the embayment of the bridge and due to these unforeseen circumstances a section of the road was to be redesigned to preserve the sub-station which is germane to the sustenance of economic activities within the region,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe added that the government has released N2.5bn to RCC as part of outstanding payment and also made available N1.17bn to enable the payment of compensation to property owners affected in the road construction.\n\nThe minister further disclosed that due to the volume of traffic on the road, it has become imperative that the road be expanded to six lanes, with additional flyovers. These, according to him, were not captured in the initial contract and design.\n\nIn the aspect of funding, Akpabio hinted that the ministry had to suspend funding over 300 projects to enable it to cater for the East-West road, adding that the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has also budgeted N35bn towards the completion of the road, while the Ministry of Finance has also earmarked funds to be committed to the same project.\n\nEarlier, the Managing Director of RCC, Engr. Nader Yusuf noted that the main issue in the Eleme Junction is in the delay of compensation to the indigenes that have properties on that axis of the road. He advised that once relevant funds are made available, payment of compensation would commence immediately.",

To this end, we will continue to epitomize best human resource management practices to promote our operational effectiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the Air Secretary, Air Vice Marshal Mahmud Madi said the timing for the conference was apt, considering the strategic importance of the human resource in achieving organizational goals and objectives.\n\nHe added that the NAF has invested hugely in human capacity development and personnel welfare in recent years which has translated to tangible gains in NAF operational conducts.\n\nThe Chief of Medical Services, Air Commodore Olabode Babalola revealed the desire of the CAS to ensure that the NAF Medical Services measure up to the global best practice.\n\nHe said the CAS approval of the Medical Conference is a further attestation of his willingness to improve healthcare delivery in the NAF.",

          "text": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared parts of southern Turkey ravaged by wildfires as \u201cdisaster areas\u201d, with the death toll from the fires rising to six after two forest workers were killed.\n\nFires across Turkey since Wednesday have burned down forests, encroaching on villages and tourist destinations and forcing people to evacuate.\n\nMinister of Agriculture and Forestry Bekir Pakdemirli said on Saturday that 88 of 98 fires that broke out amid strong winds and scorching heat have been brought under control.\n\nAt least five people have died in Manavgat and one died in Marmaris. Both towns are located on the Mediterranean and are tourist destinations.\n\nHealth Minister Fahrettin Koca said 400 people affected by the fires in Manavgat were discharged from hospitals and 10 were still receiving treatment. In Marmaris, 159 people were treated and one person was still undergoing treatment for burns.\n\nNew fires erupted in southern Hatay province where flames jumped to populated areas but appear to have been brought under control.\n\nTurkish media said hotel guests in parts of the Aegean town of Bodrum were told to evacuate and authorities called on private boats and yachts to assist in evacuation efforts by sea.President Erdogan was visiting affected areas on Saturday, inspecting from a helicopter.\n\nErdogan declared the regions affected by the forest fires \u201cdisaster areas\u201d in a statement on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to take all necessary steps to heal our nation\u2019s wounds, compensate for its losses, and improve its opportunities,\u201d said Erdogan.\n\nSpeaking from the town of Manavgat, in the south of Turkey, Erdogan said at a press conference later on Saturday that while Ankara was not looking to politicise the incident, it was also \u201cconsidering the possibility of sabotage\u201d and an investigation was under way to determine the causes of the fires.\n\nTurkey has blamed some previous forest fires on arson or outlawed groups such as the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\n\nErdogan said the government would provide compensation for families who lost their homes or agricultural lands. He said taxes, social security and credit payments would be postponed for those affected and small businesses would be offered credit with zero interest.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do anything beyond wishing the mercy of God for the lives we have lost but we can replace everything that was burned,\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan said the number of planes fighting the fires had been increased from six to 13, including planes from Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran, and that thousands of Turkish personnel as well as dozens of helicopters and drones were assisting the firefighting efforts.\n\nSpeaking from Antalya, Al Jazeera\u2019s Resul Serdar said there are still active forest fires in at least 10 locations in Turkey.\n\n\u201cErdogan said that huge efforts are in place to bring the fires under control. Yet it is still very difficult \u2026 fires keep erupting,\u201d Serdar said.\n\nWildfires are common in Turkey\u2019s Mediterranean and Aegean regions during the arid summer months.\n\nMore than 2,600 fires have erupted each year on average in the last decade, but that figure jumped to almost 3,400 last year, said Husrev Ozkara, vice-chair of the Turkish Foresters Association.\n\nA heatwave across southern Europe, fed by hot air from Africa, has led to wildfires across the Mediterranean.\n\nTemperatures in Greece and nearby countries in southeast Europe are expected to climb to 42 degrees Celsius (more than 107 Fahrenheit) on Monday in many cities and towns and ease only later next week.\n\nExperts have said climate change is fuelling extreme weather events around the world, including wildfires and floods.\n\nMark Diesendorf, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia, told Al Jazeera that climate change is producing heatwaves and droughts, which in turn creates dry vegetation that more easily ignites large fires.\n\n\u201cVery often most of that ignition is caused by lightning \u2026 and then you have a firestorm,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best job the politicians can do now is to respond and mitigate climate change, which is the main, driving factor that\u2019s increasing the severity and the frequency of these wildfires and also of floods.\u201d",

          "text": "Police in Beijing have detained Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu on suspicion of rape. Wu\u2019s detention on Saturday came after a 19-year-old student accused the singer of date-raping her when she was 17.\n\nThe claim prompted widespread condemnation of Wu on Chinese social media and resulted in several luxury brands dropping deals with him. The 30-year-old star denies the claims.\n\nPolice in Beijing said in a statement that Wu was \u201ccriminally detained\u201d on suspicion of rape \u201cin response to relevant information reported on the internet\u201d including that he \u201crepeatedly lured young women to have sexual relations\u201d.\n\nThe statement gave no further details.\n\nNews of Wu\u2019s detention was trending as the most searched topic on Weibo on Saturday night, and some users online started commenting on Wu\u2019s social media account, telling him to \u201cget out of China\u201d.\n\nWu also holds Canadian citizenship, according to the police.\n\nThe official paper of the Communist Party, the People\u2019s Daily, weighed in on the case, saying in a short opinion post online that \u201cHaving a foreign nationality is not a protective talisman, and no matter how big the name is, there is no immunity.\u201d\n\nWu originally shot to fame as a member of the K-pop boyband EXO, before leaving in 2014 to launch a successful solo career as a singer, actor, model and variety show judge.\n\nThe teenager publicised her accusations against him on social media last month and later in an interview with the internet portal NetEase.\n\nAccording to the interview, she thought she was meeting Wu for a career opportunity. Instead, his staff who was present forced her to drink.\n\nAs someone who did not go to bars, she said her tolerance was low and she was drunk after two drinks. The next day, she woke up in Wu\u2019s bed. That morning, he was kind to her and promised to take care of her, she said.\n\nThe teenager said that was the beginning of what she had thought was their relationship. This was the case until March when he stopped returning her messages.\n\nAt first, she said she felt sorry for herself. But after she learned that there were other women who had been treated similarly, she said she felt there were others who were worse off.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this is just my own personal matter. You can even say that this is a problem with the atmosphere in China\u2019s entertainment circle,\u201d she said in the NetEase interview.\n\nSince her accusations, more people have spoken out online, accusing Wu\u2019s staff of predatory behaviour such as inviting them to boozy karaoke parties.\n\nBrands, including Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, L\u2019Oreal Men and Porsche, last week suspended their partnerships with him as a result of the escalating fallout.\n\nWu, who grew up between Vancouver and Guangzhou, has denied all allegations of assault and insisted he was innocent in multiple social media statements.\n\nThe singer said on July 19 that he had met the young woman on December 5, 2020, but \u201cI didn\u2019t force her to drink,\u201d and \u201cthere was not this sort of \u2018details\u2019 she describes\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have never \u2018coerced women into sex\u2019 or engaged in \u2018date rape\u2019,\u201d he wrote, adding that he does not sleep with underage girls.\n\nWu\u2019s studio also published a lengthy response to the teenager\u2019s claims, denying any wrongdoing and alleging that she tried to extort his staff for millions of yuan and falsified her accusations.\n\nWhen the claims surfaced, luxury firm Bulgari said it \u201cattaches great importance to the incident relating to Kris Wu and decided to terminate all related collaborations with Wu from today\u201d.\n\nHis lawyers are suing the teenager for defamation.\n\nThe student has said she is also taking legal action against Wu and said the star had attempted to buy her silence with 500,000 yuan ($77,100).",

          "title": "How Nairobi Became a Thriving Arts Hub",
          "text": "For many years, the cultural spotlight in Africa has seemed to be stubbornly focused on the west or south of the continent rather than East Africa.\n\nAnd yet from Sudan and Ethiopia to Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania, this large, ancient and multifaceted region is brimming with unique histories, peoples and stories.\n\nMuch of this cultural verve is centred on Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, which has emerged as a creative hub.\n\nThe city boasts the annual East African Art Auction, the largest in the region that has taken place since 2013. This auction has put the city on the contemporary art map in Africa despite stiff competition from Cape Town and Lagos.\n\nNairobi is also an anchor for those fleeing conflict across the region. In the process they have created one of the continent\u2019s most exciting art scenes.\n\nOne such person is the Sudanese artist ltayeb Dawelbait, who took refuge in the city after fleeing the authoritarian regime of Omar al-Bashir and a hostile environment for artistic expression in Sudan.\n\nIn the two decades Eltayeb has lived in Nairobi, his artwork has been able to thrive with stunning results.\n\nWorking from his studio in the Westlands district of the city, his work is inspired by his rural Sudanese upbringing and the everyday encounters he has in Nairobi through portraits or simply objects he has found or recycled.\n\nFor example, for his 2019 piece Encounter, he depicts the male and female form painted on a set of doors discovered in the fabric of Nairobi, the paints are natural, which he himself mixes.\n\nHe is known for his inventive use of such materials, not only resurrecting these objects sourced from his beloved Nairobi, but reimagining their histories through his artistic practice.\n\n\u201cYou find a lot of different artists from countries around the world living in Nairobi. It is very inspiring \u2013 you can see new artists with new styles every day and that makes me happy, it encourages me,\u201d he told me when I interviewed him for a recent episode of Stance, a podcast about arts and culture.\n\nAnd Eltayeb is not alone.\n\nEthiopian artist Fitsum Berhe Woldelibanos has worked in the city creating vivid, brilliant pieces that examine the human form, often through portraits.\n\nBeyond Nairobi, across East Africa, creatives are also shaping a new cultural palette, fusing ancient histories with contemporary realities.\n\nIn Mogadishu, Italian-b rn Somali architect Omar Degan is re-examining the recent histories of a city ravaged by war.\n\nThrough his practice and contemporary documentation of decimated monuments and buildings, we get a different view of Mogadishu \u2013 not just a shell of a city synonymous with war, but a city made up of a unique architectural legacy rooted in ancient, colonial and post-colonial times.\n\nWhen we met on Stance, he spoke of the conflict in Somalia not only destroying the buildings and roads, but also destroying a \u201csense of belonging\u201d. For him, in order to recreate all this in particular, Somalis need buildings \u201cthey recognise as their own\u201d.\n\nThis burgeoning cultural output has been noticed in the West as well. US-based Ethiopian writer Meron Hadero has become the first person from her country to win the prestigious AKO Caine Prize for African Writing.\n\nJudges described her short story, Much of The Street Sweep, as \u201cutterly without self-pity\u201d, and said it \u201cturns the lens\u201d on the usual clich\u00e9s. It is about an Ethiopian boy called Getu, who has to navigate the fraught power dynamics of NGOs and foreign aid in the capital Addis Ababa.\n\nLast year, another US-based Ethiopian writer, Maaza Mengiste, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for her brilliant novel The Shadow King. Set during fascist Italy\u2019s 1935 occupation of Ethiopia, it centres on the lives of women fighters.\n\nHadero\u2019s prize follows that of the Ugandan Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, who in May won the Jhalak literary prize for British or British resident writers of colour with her novel The First Woman, a coming of age story of a young girl set during the brutal rule of Idi Amin in Uganda.\n\nAnd in 2020, the noted US-based Somali chef Hawa Hassan released a widely acclaimed cookbook In Bibi\u2019s Kitchen that spotlights the cuisine of East Africa, putting the region on the international culinary map.\n\nMeanwhile, the Royal Academy of Arts in London is currently hosting a major exhibition by Kenyan-born figurative painter Michael Armitage.\n\nHis striking, lush and magical exhibition brings together 15 of his large-scale paintings from recent years that unpack the people, stories and landscapes of East Africa.\n\nThis exhibition also includes works by other East African contemporary artists such as Asaph Ng\u2019ethe Macua, Meek Gichugu and Sane Wadu.\n\nDespite these recent successes, East Africa remains underrated for its cultural weight, with much of the media\u2019s attention continuing to focus on war, conflict and displacement.\n\nThis sadly misses the cultural growth taking place in cities across the region, from Addis Ababa, to Khartoum to Mogadishu \u2013 a city, though scarred by war that now hosts a literary festival, a new art museum and theatre.\n\nI travel widely in this region from Dar es Salaam and Mombasa to Hargeisa and I am always struck by how many brilliant artists, writers and musicians there are here, and am also struck by the need for their work to be more widely known and appreciated.\n\nIt is a region fizzing with creative flare, imagination and boldness that deserves to be recognised and celebrated.\n\nIsmail Einashe for BBC",

          "title": "MTN Nigeria Records $1.9bn Revenue in Q1 2021",
          "text": "MTN Nigeria o Saturday declared revenue of N790.3 billion (about $1.9bn), representing an increase of 24.1 per cent in its unedited half year results for the period that ended on June 30, 2021.\n\nThe company\u2019s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA), grew by 27.6 per cent to reach N417.2 billion. The EBITDA margin improved by 1.4 percentage points to 52.7 per cent and its Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) was up by 39.1 per cent to reach N186.4 billion.\n\nIts dividend per share rose to N4.55 kobo, which is about 30 per cent increase.\n\nThe telecoms company, however, suffered losses in the number of mobile subscribers and data subscriptions.\n\nAccording to the report, mobile subscribers declined by 7.6 million to 68.9 million, impacted by the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations.\n\nActive data users also declined by approximately 52,000 to 32.5 million.\n\nGiving details of the telecoms company\u2019s operational review for the half year, MTN Nigeria CEO, Mr. Karl Toriola said: \u201cService revenue grew by 24.1 per cent, Year-on-Year (YoY), driven by the sustained growth in data and also partly due to the lower base in comparative 2020 voice revenue that resulted from lockdowns during that period.\n\n\u201cVoice revenue grew by 13.1 per cent, benefitting from an 11.8 per cent increase in traffic and our customer value management (CVM) initiatives. The impact on voice revenue from the industry-wide suspension of new SIM registration was partly offset by higher usage in our active SIM base as well as migration to a higher quality of experience.\n\n\u201cData revenue continued the positive momentum from H2 2020, rising by 48.3 per cent,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said this was driven by increased usage from the existing base, supported by the acceleration in our 4G rollout and enhanced network capacity following the acquisition and activation of additional 800MHz spectrum in Q1.\n\nThe results showed that data traffic rose by 83.0 per cent YoY, while smartphone penetration was up by 5.8pp to 49.3 per cent.\n\n\u201cOur 4G network now covers 65.1 per cent of the population, up from 60.1 per cent in December 2020,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, Fintech revenue rose by 48.2 per cent driven by increased adoption of Xtratime and the core fintech services.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expand our MoMo agent network and broaden our service offerings. Our registered MoMo agents increased by 121,000 in H1 2021 to more than 515,000,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting further on the results, Toriola said: \u201cIn the first half of 2021, we made good progress strengthening the resilience of the business, managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and enhancing support to our people, customers and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe extended our commitment to the Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) with an additional N3 billion contribution over a two-year period, half of which has already been paid. This is in support of efforts to promote the health and security of Nigerians, as we navigate our way through the pandemic, and in line with our Y\u2019ello Hope initiatives through which we provided support to our broad base of stakeholders to the value of approximately N25 billion in 2020.\n\n\u201cOur progress towards achieving greater business resilience is reflected in the upgrade by Global Credit Ratings (GCR) of our national scale long-term issuer rating to AAA and affirmation of our national scale short-term rating of A1+ with a stable outlook. This puts MTN Nigeria on the highest possible GCR scale for short-term and long-term ratings, providing a solid platform for growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, 2021 would mark the 20th anniversary of MTN\u2019s presence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate this milestone, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved our participation in the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit (RITC) Scheme. This is in response to government\u2019s drive towards public-private partnerships in the rehabilitation of critical road infrastructure in Nigeria. We intend to participate in the restoration and refurbishment of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway. Conversations in this regard have already commenced, and further announcements will be made in due course,\u201d Toriola explained.\n\n\u201cIn line with our desire to plant deeper and more permanent roots in Nigeria, we have also initiated plans to commission a purpose-built, state of the art MTN Head Office, designed to act as a central hub for our network, a catalyst for creativity and innovation, and a showcase for the flexible working structures that are driving efficiency gains in this new normal working environment.\n\n\u201cAligned with our wider commitment to environmental sustainability, it will meet the highest global environmental standards, demonstrating the role of green technology in our future,\u201d Toriola added.\n\nHe promised that MTN would continue to invest in improved world class services and its network, accelerating the expansion of its 4G coverage and providing home broadband.\n\n\u201cAs part of our rural connectivity programme, we plan to connect approximately 1,000 rural communities to our network this year with an additional 2,000 communities in 2022.

          "title": "Burkina Faso Sees More Child Soldiers as Jihadi Attacks Rise",
          "text": "Awoken by gunshots in the middle of the night, Fatima Amadou was shocked by what she saw among the attackers: children.\n\nGuns slung over their small frames, the children chanted \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d as they surrounded her home in Solhan town in Burkina Faso\u2019s Sahel region. Some were so young they couldn\u2019t even pronounce the words, Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d said the 43-year-old mother.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the kids, what came to my mind was that (the adults) trained these kids to be assassins, and they came to kill my children,\u201d Amadou told The Associated Press by phone from Sebba town, where she now lives.\n\nShe and her family are among the lucky ones who survived the June attack, in which about 160 people were killed \u2014 the deadliest such assault since the once-peaceful West African nation was overrun by fighters linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State about five years ago. As that violence increases, so too does the recruitment of child soldiers.\n\nThe number of children recruited by armed groups in Burkina Faso rose at least five-fold so far this year, up from four documented cases in all of last year, according to information seen by the AP in an unpublished report by international aid and conflict experts.\n\nAt least 14 boys are being held in the capital, Ouagadougou, for alleged association with militant armed groups, some there since 2018, said Idrissa Sako, assistant to Burkina Faso\u2019s public prosecutor at the high court in the city.\n\nAmadou said she saw about seven children with the fighters who surrounded her home during the Solhan attack. She did not see them kill anyone, but they helped burn down houses.\n\n\u201cWe are alarmed by the presence of children with armed groups,\u201d said Sandra Lattouf, the representative for the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, or UNICEF, in the country.\n\nThe effects of the conflict on children \u2014 including their recruitment as soldiers but also attacks on schools and kids themselves \u2014 have become so concerning that this year Burkina Faso was added for the first time to the U.N.\u2019s annual report on Children and Armed Conflict.\n\nAid groups say they are seeing more children with jihadi fighters at roadside checkpoints in the Sahel \u2014 an arid region that passes through Burkina Faso but stretches straight across the African continent just south of the Sahara. In recent years, the western Sahel has become an epicenter of jihadi violence.\n\nDuring a recent trip to Dori, a town in the region where nearly 1,200 people fled after the attack on Solhan, the AP spoke with eight survivors, five of whom said they either heard or saw children partake in the violence.\n\n\u201cWe heard them say, \u2018we good children have come to change Solhan in a better way,\u2019\u201d said Hama Amadou, a resident, who hid in his shop during the fighting. He said he also heard women directing the children, saying \u201ckill him, kill him.\u201d\n\nBurkina Faso\u2019s ill-equipped and undertrained army is struggling to stem the violence, which has killed thousands and displaced 1.3 million people since the jihadi attacks began.\n\nExperts on child recruitment say that poverty pushes some kids toward armed groups. Sako, who works with the public prosecutor, said some children who wanted money to enroll in school joined because they were promised approximately $18 if they killed someone. Others were promised gifts like motorbikes.\n\nBut civil society organizations also accuse army troops of contributing to the problem by committing abuses against civilians suspected of being jihadis.\n\n\u201cThere are more security operations \u2026 (so) there are more military abuses,\u201d said Maimouna Ba, head of operations for Women for the Dignity of the Sahel, a Dori-based advocacy group. \u201cIt is hard for a child to get up in the morning and see that their father was killed.\u201d As they get older, children may become angry and start asking why the state isn\u2019t helping them, she said.\n\nThe army denied these allegations, along with accusations that it was slow in responding to the attack in Solhan, but would not provide a detailed comment.\n\nThe deteriorating security is sparking unrest, with protests across the country demanding the government take stronger action. In response, President Roch Marc Christian Kabore fired his security and defense ministers, appointing himself minister of defense.\n\nAmid this raft of problems, Burkina Faso must now also figure out what to do with the children accused of being affiliated with armed groups.\n\nNone of the boys being held in Ouagadougou has been put on trial, according to Sako. The government has not yet signed an agreement with the United Nations that would help it to treat such children as victims, not perpetrators, for instance, by moving them from prison to centers where they could receive psychological care.\n\n\u201cIt is a real concern for us to find a permanent solution for children,\u201d said Sako.\n\nPreventing further recruitment, meanwhile, means tackling economic hardship and all that comes with it, including helping kids who have left school to catch up on their lessons.\n\n\u201cNeglecting to act now will only lead to a more intractable crisis and greater instability in the months and years ahead, giving these armed groups the heartbreaking advantage they are so violently seeking,\u201d said Dr. Samantha Nutt, founder and president of War Child Canada and War Child USA.\n\nFor now, many parents, already struggling to feed, clothe and educate their kids, feel powerless to protect them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really afraid for my child to be recruited by jihadis,\u201d said Isma Heella, a Dori resident and father to a 4-year-old boy. \u201cWe fear for our children and for ourselves as parents because we are not stronger than them.\u201d",
