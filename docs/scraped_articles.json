          "text": "The Lagos State Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Musiliu Akinsanya, aka MC Oluomo, has refuted claims of engaging in acts of insubordination and anti-union activities in the state.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the national headquarters of the union queried Akinsanya for refusing to carry out instructions given to him in recent times by the national leadership.\n\nAmong other allegations in the query dated February 14, 2022, Akinsanya was also accused of resorting to intimidation, harassment, and assault on the newly-appointed Chairman, Tricycle Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Azeez Abiola, aka Istijabah.\n\nIn his response, Akinsanya, who said he had successfully complied with his oath of office, refuted the claim that he instigated members of the union to assault Abiola.\n\nHe, however, noted that the legality of the TOOAN operations in the state is a subject of a suit pending before the National Industrial Court.\n\nAkinsanya responded to the query in a letter he personally signed on February 25, 2022, a copy of which was obtained by our correspondent on Tuesday.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cI vividly recollect that on Wednesday, February 9, 2022, at a meeting you held with the Lagos State Administrative Council at the national secretariat, Abuja, you announced the appointment of Alhaji Azeez Abiola, one of the state trustees and Chairman of Zone C TOOAN of NURTW, as the National Coordinator, TOOAN, right in our presence.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately, before we got back to Lagos, Alhaji Azeez Abiola has been parading himself on social media as the new state chairman of TOOAN of NURTW, and posting a letter of appointment to that effect, a letter I was neither aware of nor privy to.\n\n\u201cThis is in spite of the fact that the existence and legality of TOOAN is already an issue at the National Industrial Court and the Lagos State Council is presently funding the defence in NICN/LA/308/2021, all in an effort to protect the corporate image of the union.\n\n\u201cI restate that I am not aware of any harassment, intimidation or assault on him or any of his supporters on any day in Lagos. As a trustee, he has the right of entry to the state secretariat and has never been denied that right to my knowledge. It will be demeaning of me to instruct people to beat up his supporters and I never did.\u201d\n\nAkinsanya added that the former state secretariat situated at 360, Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway, Super Bus Stop, Abule-Egba, Lagos, had already been contracted to the Amalgamated Mega-City Transport Limited for the use of BRT buses operations.\n\nHe added that the company, which had taken over the place, was paying rent to the state NURTW, adding that income from the said venture is routinely sent to the national headquarters.\n\n\u201cThere is, therefore, no former state secretariat to hand over as same is contractually obligated to the Amalgamated Mega-City Transport Limited to his knowledge and our knowledge,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to the allegations on forceful takeover of local branches and the illegal splitting of the TOOAN sector in the state, Akinsanya said his administration, which was based on the promotion of peace, opposed forceful takeover of branches.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf any of the zonal chairmen to whom the branches belong however bring the issue to our attention, it shall be investigated openly and the cause/reason determined.\n\n\u201cThe decision to rearrange the tricycle segment of our operations was reached by the entire executive of the state with the knowledge and approval of the President.\n\n\u201cThe initial plan was a three-zone arrangement, but we accommodated the wishes of the President for a five-zone arrangement and his nomination of two zonal chairmen.\n\n\u201cThe action is neither illegal nor unconstitutional as it is within our constitutional rights as the elected leaders of the state council and it was done with the concurrence of the National President.\n\n\u201cIt was never to create rivalry and/or disharmony and until now, the peace that we have in Lagos State, was never experienced by previous administrations.\n\n\u201cI restate that I have faithfully complied with my oath of office and will never do anything to tarnish the image of the union nor bring the union back to the inglorious position of being branded as thugs and disturbers of public peace and space in Lagos State.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nParty zones secretary to S-West\n\nNo plan to shift convention date \u2014 APC govs\n\nBuni absent at meeting\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nABUJA\u2014GOVERNORS of the All Progressives Congress, APC, were, yesterday, unable to convince President Muhammadu Buhari in their attempt to make him change his mind on his preference for Senator Abdulahi Adamu as the consensus candidate for the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nThe APC governors on the platform of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, met with the president at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, shortly before he departed for Kenya.\n\nThis came as the South-East geopolitical zone has lost out in its bid to produce the national secretary of the party in the forthcoming national convention.\n\nIt was learned that the office of the national secretary was zoned to South-West rather than their region.\n\nThe South-East APC leaders, it was further learned, have resolved to take their agitation for the party scribe post to a meeting of the APC that was expected to hold later, yesterday night.\n\nSources at the meeting blamed the representatives of the South East at the meeting for not being forceful enough in their demand.\n\nThough, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, who has indicated interest to contest for presidency in 2023, was absent, Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State and the outgoing deputy governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke, were present.\n\nA Presidency source said the APC governors had hoped to get President Buhari to change his mind on the former Nasarawa State governor and serving senator, who has since emerged as his favourite for the party top job.\n\nThe source said the governors\u2019 efforts hit brick walls as the president was said to have bluntly refused to shift ground when the governors presented their reasons against Adamu, who currently represents Nasarawa West senatorial district.\n\nThe governors were led to the meeting with the President by the chairman of the PGF and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nAside Bagudu, other APC governors at the meeting were Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Aminu Masari (Katsina), Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Uzodimma (Imo), Gboyega Oyetola (Osun), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Sani Bello (Niger), Umar Ganduje (Kano), and the outgoing deputy governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke.\n\nEven after the meeting with the president, some of the governors, who were rattled by the president\u2019s insistence on Adamu were seen speaking in hush tones and planning on their next step.\n\nIt was gathered that the chairman of the APC Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC, and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, was also absent at the meeting.\n\nNo plan to shift convention date \u2014 APC govs\n\nThe governors affirmed that there was no plan to move the national convention of the party from the scheduled date of March 26, 2022, in Abuja despite the tight time frame provided by the time table of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, just released for next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nThere had been speculation that a section of the party was pushing for the postponement of the national convention so that both the election of the national executives and the primaries to select its candidates for the 2023 elections could be done simultaneously.\n\nFielding questions from State House correspondents after the meeting with the president, the PGF chairman, Bagudu, assured that the March 26 date for the exercise was sacrosanct.\n\nHe said the governors met with the president to congratulate him for signing the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and as well on the victory of the APC in some of the by-elections conducted, weekend.\n\nAsked if the idea of further postponement of the convention was discussed at the meeting, Bagudu said: \u201cLast week, we were in this hall (Villa), about 20 APC governors, and this question came up and we clearly said we came to discuss the national convention, which is slated for March 26 and are working hard to ensure that on March 26, we have our convention and elect our national officers and that remains the case.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed speculation the APC governors were still divided over the direction of the party, especially after what seemed to be an altercation among them as they emerged from the meeting with the President.\n\nOn the necessity for the yesterday meeting, Bagudu explained: \u201cToday (Tuesday), March 1, a number of APC governors came to Mr. President to, among others, congratulate him on signing the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThis is something many Nigerians have expressed different views about, but Mr. President had once again taken the courageous step of, even while having observations, signed and requested the National Assembly to look at it. So, we congratulate the National Assembly for passage of the amendments and equally congratulate Mr. President for signing the amendment.\n\n\u201cSecond, our party, the APC, participated in a number of by-elections over the last weekend and equally we congratulated Mr. President and in addition, we spoke about other issues that concern our party.\u201d\n\nBagudu dismissed insinuation that governors were still not comfortable with certain provisions of the Act, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve always had cause to address this, legislation everywhere in the world is based on continuous improvement. Constitutions that are 200 years old are subject to reviews sometimes and those reviews are not cut and dry. Even people who truly believe in the need for a legislation may have worries about the implications of it.\u201d\n\nIt was also learned that Southeast APC governors also complained about the zoning of the office of the national secretary to South West rather than their region, with Bagudu telling them that it was too late to amend the zoning formula.\n\nDespite the position of the chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, the South East governors were said to have expressed their resolve to take their agitation for the party scribe post to a meeting of the APC governors that was expected to hold later yesterday night.",

This has put immense pressure on government to ensure prudent management of resources, improve transparency and accountability in the utilization of funds from donor agencies for maximum positive impact on the economy.\u201d\n\nShe said donor financing, especially from multilateral bodies such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank, was one of the critical sources of funds for the execution of key projects in the country, and noted that the nation was not receiving the best from the implementation of donor financed projects.\n\nShe stated: \u201cNotwithstanding the efforts and resources committed in procuring development financing for critical sectors of the economy to boost human capital development, improve infrastructure and service delivery as well as strengthen governance and institutions, the country appears not to have made the desired progress in this direction. Much still remains to be streamlined.\n\n\u201cIt is important to mention that when borrowed funds fail to be properly utilised, and to deliver on planned development objectives, growth is impaired and economic development is distorted.\n\n\u201cAn in-depth review of the level of implementation of the entire development projects reveals that delays in the execution of donor-funded projects stems from factors including bureaucratic bottlenecks, capacity challenges, political interference and challenges associated with obtaining varied and misaligned approvals processes between our local authorities and development partners.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Nigeria ranks low compared to other nations of the world in terms of the level of implementation of World Bank funded projects.\u201d\n\nTask force on donor-funded projects\n\nThe minister announced a task force on disbursement, in Donor-Funded Projects in Nigeria, to quicken the implementation of such projects.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cthe Term of Reference (ToR) of the task force is to evaluate, review and chart a fresh course to significantly increase disbursement levels in donor-financed projects in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is to also work with relevant stakeholders to facilitate various approval processes for donor-assisted projects before final approval from the National Assembly.\u201d",

Recall that the Federal Government had following a favourable court judgment obtained by Rivers State, sought to limit VAT to the Exclusive List.\n\nThey separately also shut down the provision for immunity and life pension for principal officers of the National Assembly.\n\nThe Senate voted on the report of the Constitution Review Committee on the 5th Alteration Bill\u2019s, 2022 in its move to restructure Nigeria as 68 Bills were listed to be voted on.\n\nREAD ALSOReps reject bill for special seats for women in parliament\n\nThe House of Reps members bared their minds in the voting exercise to decide 68 clauses listed by the Joint Special Ad-hoc Committee of the House on the 1999 constitutional review.\n\nThe Senate which abrogated the State/Local Government Joint Account, provided for special Account into which shall be paid all allocations due to local governments from the Federation Account.\n\nThe Upper Chamber has also passed a Bill to establish Local Government as a tier of government and guarantee their democratic existence and tenure, just as it passed a Bill to provide for the financial independence of state House of Assembly and Judiciary.\n\nThe Senate also killed a bill that is designed to provide for special seat for women in the National and State House of Assembly; and for Related Matters.\u201d\n\nDuring the voting on the Bill on VAT by the Senate, which is number 34, 95 Senators registered, yes voted to kill it was 41, No was 44, abstain stood at 0 and total 85.\n\nAlso rejected were bills for the removal of Transitional Law-making Powers of the Executive; even as they turned down life pension for President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila and others even as they rejected the tempting offer of immunity for serving presiding officer, and also rejected a bill to provide for Diaspora voting; to grant Mayoralty Status for the FCT; and appointment of Minister from the FCT.\n\nThe Senate also rejected a bill to Provide for the termination of tenure of certain Elected officials on Account of change of political party; and for Related Matters.\n\nThe Senate also moved the Railway from the Exclusive Legislative List to Concurrent Legislative List, even as a Bill on devolution of powers to move Airports from Exclusive Legislative List to the Concurrent Legislative List and for Related Matters was passed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate failed to pass a Bill to provide for the procedure for Overriding Executive Veto in Respect of Money Bill, just as it passed a bill to Abrogate the State Joint Local Government Account and Provide for special Account into which shall be paid all Allocations due to Local Government Councils from the Federation Account and from the Government of the State.\n\nThe Senate has also passed a bill to empower the National Assembly and State Assemblies to summon the President and State Governors to answer questions bothering on security or any other issues on which the National and State Houses of Assembly have powers to make laws.\n\nIt also passed a bill to make it an offence, and to provide for the possible conviction of any person who refuses to honour the summons of the National Assembly or any of its committee.\n\nPresident of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan, who came up with the rules, said that 68 documents in all harmonized by both chambers of the National Assembly will be considered for voting.\n\nA Bill to Change the Name Barikin Ladi Local Government Area; and for Related Matters failed to sail through, just as it passed a Bill to Correct the Name of Correct name Atigbo Local Government Area; and for Related Matters and a Bill to Correct the Name of Obia/Akpor Local Government Area.\n\nThe proposed bill for an Act as submitted by DSP Ovie Omo-Agege and DS Wase Idris to both the red and green chambers of the National Assembly, Federal Republic of Nigeria dated 22nd February 2022.\n\nAt the Reps sitting, immunity clause for presiding officers failed to fly.\n\nValue Added Tax failed to make exclusive list\n\nThe House also refused to make VAT an exclusive concern of the Federal Government.\n\nThe result showed that the members voted 200 against the clause while 91 voted yea. No one abstained.\n\nThe bill to separate the office of Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, from the Minister of Justice to make both office two henceforth also got the approval of the House.\n\nIt will be recalled that prior to now, a lone person functions as both the AGF and the Minister.\n\nThe House said separating them would give room for professionalism and speedy dispensation of justice.\n\nFor the first time in the political history of Nigeria, there is now a constitutional provision for independent candidacy.\n\nThe import of this is that private citizens can decide to run for political office without having to belong to any political party.\n\nThe voting pattern indicated that 269 voted for while 28 voted against and thre persons abstained.\n\nThe Reps okayed autonomy for State Legislature, Judiciary.\n\nThe clamour for the autonomy of State Legislature and the Judiciary also received a constitutional passage.\n\nThe clause got 286 votes in favour as against a lone vote. No one abstained from the voting.\n\nReps rejected power to override President on his veto to constitution review, money bills\n\nReject diaspora voting\n\nThe lawmakers also rejected a bill seeking to make Nigerians resident abroad to participate in the election process by giving them voting rights.\n\nThe House also voted to abrogate the joint account system between the local government and the State just as it rectified the government as the third tier in the hierarchy of governments.\n\nBill to empower parliament to summon President and others passed.\n\nThe House also voted in favour of a bill seeking to confer on the parliament the powers to summon persons to appear before it for explanation on public issues.\n\nThe members also voted to give a timeline for the presentation of budget and also approved 30 days for the submission of names for ministerial nominees.\n\nBills to give extra seats for women in parliaments, political parties refuse to fly .\n\nThe House also refused to give nod to bills seeking to give exclusive extra seats for women in the National Assembly and State Houses of Assembly; positions in the political parties.\n\nEarlier before the House commenced voting, the House ushered in Mrs. Dolapo, the wife of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo to observe the plenary session.\n\nBut hardly had the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila called the House Leader, Ado Doguwa to move the motion for her to be admitted that the shouts of \u201cnay\u201d greeted the chamber.\n\nAmidst the nay and yes, the speaker asked Beni Lar to second the motion.\n\nThe 68 bills seek to further amend the 1999 Constitution (5th alteration) are: To Abrogate the State Joint Local Government Account and Provide for special Account into which shall be paid all Allocations due to Local Government Councils from the Federation Account and from the Government of the State;

But, after serving about 12 cars, and 11 motorcyclists, the manager announced that the fuel was finished.\n\nAccording to him, many of them left immediately knowing that they purposely refused to sell.\n\n\u201cI was amazed when I heard that, a particular filling station is about to offload fuel.

          "text": "Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has urged the National Assembly to ensure that corrupt governors do not sabotage the bill granting Local Government financial autonomy.\n\nThe rights group also carpeted the National Assembly for voting out pro-women provisions in the constitution review.\n\nHURIWA hailed the 9th Senate for passing the bill to grant financial and administrative autonomy to all the 774 local government areas of the country.\n\nBut frowned at the lawmakers\u2019 decision voted against all positive laws aimed at enhancing political and economic emancipation of Nigerian women, describing this as backward, primitive and tragic.\n\nThe group said it was sad that especially the negative votes against pro-women constitutional provisions took place ironically on the first day of International Women\u2019s Month.\n\nHURIWA stated that it is outrageous and sad to note that Nigeria\u2019s central law-making body dominated almost entirely by men behaved in a chauvinistic manner when Nigeria\u2019s 9th National Assembly; declined citizenship to the foreign-born husband of a Nigerian woman whereas a Nigerian man\u2019s foreign-born wife gets automatic citizenship.\n\nOther votes that affected women are: women denied the ability to take indigeneship of their husband\u2019s state after five years of being together; denied 35% appointed positions for women; denied women 35 percent affirmative action in party administration and leadership; rejected specific seats for women in the National Assembly.\n\nHURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, urged the members of the red chamber to ensure that the bill is also passed by their colleagues in the House of Representatives and eventually assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari and the 36 state governors.\n\nAccording to reports, the proposed law seeks to amend the 1999 Constitution to repeal the state joint local government account and provide for a special account where all allocations due to the local governments\u2019 councils, from the federation account and state government, shall be paid.\n\nIn the bill, each local government council is to create and maintain its own special account to be called the Local Government Allocation Account into which all the allocations will be paid.\n\nFor administrative autonomy, the bill seeks to allow local governments to conduct their own elections.\n\nHURIWA hailed the landmark passage of the bill by the Senate, noting that the law when passed eventually would answer the year-long yearnings of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria as well as the decade-old clamour for restructuring and true federalism by socio-political groups including Afenifere and Ohanaeze Ndigbo.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s Onwubiko said, \u201cThe Ahmad Lawan-led Senate should be commended for this landmark legislation has reached the crescendo.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Senate must diligently follow through to ensure the assent to the bill by the executive as it may not pass because the state Houses of Assembly in Nigeria are hijacked by governors who steal from local government funds under the guise of running joint local government and state account.\n\n\u201cThere are grave consequences of voting against these provisions already passed at the National level by the National Assembly which may be fought against by governors that are proving to be some of the most depraved and corrupt political office holders in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAdministrative and financial autonomy for local government areas are long overdue and these would go a long way to cut LGs dependence on states and boost rapid development at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cAmongst many others, autonomy for LGs would revive local economies, improve well being, infrastructure and security at the grassroots level as well as check the insane rural to urban migration that constitutes grave threats to national development and national security.\n\n\u201cTo be extra clear, the proposed bill which if sees the light of the day would see to the realization of community policing as local governments would have the funds to mobilise their various security apparatus to protect their people.\n\n\u201cCommunity-based groups, religious bodies, town unions must mount pressure on their state assemblies and governors not to jeopardise this revolutionary provision to bring developments and democracy to the grassroots and restore the proper democracy to the masses.\n\n\u201cAlso, religious bodies and town unions must sensitise their communities on the benefits of reestablishing democracy at the local government level and autonomy in terms of finance and operational independence with elected councils having stable and uninterrupted tenures.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, viable local governments have the inevitable potential of creating jobs for school leavers and graduates to serve their communities and grow their local economies.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of this landmark bill when it becomes law are numerous and it must be achieved before the 2023 general elections. All hands must be on the deck at this critical point.\u201d",

          "text": "The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, accompanied by the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (EVC/CEO) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, is leading the Nigerian delegation to the ongoing Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2022.\n\nThe Mobile World Congress, the most influential conference and exhibition of stakeholders in mobile technology, innovation and connectivity, is taking place in Barcelona from February 28 to March 3, 2022. The Nigerian delegation will engage global players in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sphere to explore areas of strategic collaboration and investment for accelerating the growth of Nigeria\u2019s emergent digital economy.\n\nThe Nigerian delegation is scheduled to participate in at least 33 sessions during MWC, organised by Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA). The gathering attracts the participation of the biggest manufacturers, GSM operators, mobile brands, regulators and policymakers from across the world, showcasing innovations, new announcements, new products and emergent innovations.\n\nAmong the teams Pantami will lead other participants from Nigeria to meet, are Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), representatives of the World Economic Forum (WEF), and other key actors in the global ICT ecosystem.\n\nOn arrival in Barcelona, Pantami, Danbatta and the top echelon of the Nigerian delegation hit the ground running by holding purposive strategic talks with Dynamic Spectrum Alliance (DSA), a global organization advocating for laws and regulations that will lead to more efficient and effective spectrum utilisation.\n\nThe discussion focused on spectrum sharing and unlicensed technologies as well as the progress of DSA\u2019s work in this regard, with emphasis on how DSA\u2019s processes will benefit Nigeria. The meeting took place on February 28, 2022.\n\nThe same day, the Nigerian delegation also had a meeting with Nokia and discussed potential government initiatives and how NCC and Nokia can collaborate more strategically to accomplish some policy objectives and targets of the institutionalised digital economy processes in Nigeria.\n\nOn March 1, aside from participation in other key sessions slated for the day, the Nigerian delegation met SpaceX, a satellite operator to discuss licensing and authorisation issues as they may affect SpaceX.\n\nThe Pantami-led delegation equally met with the representatives of the World Economic Forum (WEF) to explore and concretely engage about opportunities within the framework of the EDISON Alliance for Digital Inclusion, and the possibility of Nigeria becoming Lighthouse Country of the Alliance.\n\nEDISON Alliance was launched by WEF to mobilise a global movement to prioritize digital inclusion as foundational to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is envisioned to enhance the attainment of goals towards fostering affordable and accessible digital opportunities for everyone by 2025.\n\nOne significance of the deliberations with WEF is the readiness to leverage the relationship with EDISON Alliance to accelerate and foster unprecedented collaboration between the ICT community and other critical sectors of the economy in order to advance Nigeria\u2019s vision on financial inclusion.\n\nIndeed, on March 1, 2022, the Nigerian delegation is also scheduled to discuss with the MTN team, and thereafter proceed to attend a demo at Meta\u2019s Exhibition Stand, where the CEO of Meta and owner of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, is to call for global partnership to build the next world virtual reality (metaverse). A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.\n\nOn March 2, 2022, the Nigerian delegation will meet a United States (US) delegation to discuss collaboration on telecommunications and related ICT issues. The Nigerian delegation will also engage the exhibition by Huawei Technologies as well as chat with the company\u2019s senior executive management.\n\nSpeaking at the influential, global technology congress, Pantami said \u201cThe high-level discussion which Nigerian delegation is having with both original equipment manufacturers and other key players in the ICT world will enhance deeper alliance, collaboration and bilateral synergy required to accelerate Nigeria\u2019s vision for a real digital economy.\u201d\n\nAmplifying the Minister\u2019s voice, Danbatta said Nigeria\u2019s participation at the event on an annual basis is based on the realisation that \u201cMWC provides a vibrant deal-making environment for attendees, as it also remains a truly international exhibition attracting decision-makers in the mobile ecosystem which Nigeria is keen to explore to grow its telecoms and ICT industry.\u201d\n\nThe 2022 MWC is being attended by mostly senior executives and management staff of over 2000 companies, institutions and entities from 183 countries.",

          "title": "Tackling money rituals involving human sacrifice",
          "text": "Historical, anthropological, and folkloric data are replete with accounts of various rituals in every human society as far back as records existed. Such rituals were performed for various reasons, notably, the regeneration of societies, institutions, associations, and individuals. While some rituals were used to reproduce societies and memories of the past, others often involved sacrifice in order to avert evil or to attract blessings or success in an endeavour. Vestiges of these rituals exist today but with the stamp of modern societies and their vagaries.\n\nToday\u2019s money rituals have antecedents in pre-existing rituals of supplication. Such rituals often involved one form of sacrifice or the other. What is unusual in modern Nigeria is not the use of human sacrifice for such rituals. Humans were sacrificed in ancient societies, including precolonial African societies. What is alarming today is the scale and the involvement of youths in the belief that human sacrifice is a pathway to quick wealth. Whether it works or not is a totally different question. Some commentators have conflated the two issues and concluded on the basis of the latter that money ritual does not exist. I will separate both issues and address them in turn.\n\nAs indicated above, human sacrifice is not new. It was practiced widely in human societies until modern religions, notably Religions of the Book (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) began to condemn the practice and modern societies came to treat it as murder. However, ritual killing involving nonhumans continues, as witnessed for example in the killing of rams during the Muslim festival of ramadan.\n\nIn ancient societies, human sacrifice was offered for various reasons\u2014to pacify the gods or a human ruler; to ward off evil, such as enemy attack; to bring good fortune, and so on. Headhunting in some societies was a type of human sacrifice that involved taking the head, for ceremonial or magical purposes, of a killed adversary.\n\nMost examples of human sacrifice in ancient societies were carried out for the public good, rather than for personal reward as such. Accordingly, money ritual involving human sacrifice in order to get rich was unknown.\n\nIn the absence of thorough ethnographic or investigative data, most accounts of money rituals in Nigeria today are based on purported confessions of those involved, who were caught afterwards; social media reports; and commentaries by armchair columnists. One can extrapolate from these accounts that the practice is becoming prevalent and getting scarier and scarier: Youths are killing their parents, siblings, friends, and others to use their body parts in money rituals. Some of these accounts indicate that youths, especially fraudsters known as Yahoo Boys, are not the only ones involved in money rituals. Politicians, businessmen, market women, contractors, artistes, professionals, and those seeking elevation at work are also allegedly involved.\n\nNot all seekers of these rituals want to get stupendously rich. Some are just looking for whatever amount they could get from participation. In one instance, a teenage boy, who participated in a killing, recounted that he was promised N50,000 if he could bring a specific human part to the occult practitioner. Apparently, the practitioner too wants to use the human part in money ritual for others for which he would be paid.\n\nWhether money rituals work or not is immaterial to both sides. It is all about making money one way or the other. As in ancient societies, those who engage in such rituals believe that they work. This belief is reinforced today by their colleagues, who suddenly became rich, building houses and riding expensive cars.\n\nWhat is surprising about these believers is why they don\u2019t stop to ask why the practitioners themselves are not stupendously rich. Why can\u2019t they use their ritual powers to create wealth for themselves or for their relatives or friends? If specific human parts are needed for the ritual, why must they be taken from their parents, siblings, or friends, rather than from just anyone? Perhaps the answer lies in making the ritual so esoteric and outlandish to be believed.\n\nThe point about belief, though, is the willing suspension of rationality and logic. Even some parents, who should know better, are caught up in this web of belief, leading them to be willing accomplices. It takes a flight away from rationality to see a connection between human sacrifice and wealth creation.\n\nWho exactly are the occult practitioners, who order human sacrifice as passport to wealth creation? They are said to include not just some jungle priests but also alfas and pastors. Do these occult practitioners believe that human sacrifice can really create wealth? It is doubtful. Many of them are in the business of raking as much money as they can from believers.\n\nThe question now is how might this practice be stamped out? A four-prong approach is needed. First, while belief in human sacrifice as passport to wealth cannot be simply legislated out of existence, specific laws are in order that specify stiff penalties for anyone involved in human sacrifice.\n\nSecond, a select group of investigators, drawn from the intelligence, police, and local vigilante outfits, should be empowered to secretly fish out all those involved, or are planning to be involved, in human sacrifice for whatever reason and bring them to book. There are those who would argue that such a group of investigators may not be effective or may be comprised. This is Nigeria, they might say. We are doomed if every issue is approached with this mindset.\n\nThird, all investigated cases of human sacrifice should be widely publicized to show that you will be caught if you get involved in this ignoble crime. The publicity should involve advertorials in which the pictures and names of past convicts appear in major newspapers.\n\nFourth, there should be massive reorientation of society, focusing on the youths, who appear to be in the forefront of the objectionable practice of human sacrifice. The reorientation could take various forms. One, parents need proper education about effective parenting during this challenging period, typified by banditry, kidnapping, cyber fraud, human sacrifice, and relentless social media indoctrination.\n\nTwo, federal, state, and local governments should set aside funds for various programmes that would engage the youths at all levels. A key event at such programmes should be values education and the need to avoid criminal activities, including human sacrifice. The point here is to condemn the practice as much and as frequently as possible.\n\nHuman sacrifice is murder. We cannot just talk glibly about it, without coordinated action.",
          "summary": "Today\u2019s money rituals have antecedents in pre-existing rituals of supplication.\nWhat is unusual in modern Nigeria is not the use of human sacrifice for such rituals.\nAccordingly, money ritual involving human sacrifice in order to get rich was unknown.\nFirst, while belief in human sacrifice as passport to wealth cannot be simply legislated out of existence, specific laws are in order that specify stiff penalties for anyone involved in human sacrifice.\nA key event at such programmes should be values education and the need to avoid criminal activities, including human sacrifice.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nNigerian women have vowed to occupy the National Assembly beginning 8 am Wednesday until all gender-related bills in the constitution amendment exercise are reconsidered.\n\nIn a virtual press conference held Tuesday night attended by over 200 civil society organisations and the media, Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, a Nigerian lawyer and civil rights activist, said the women will demand an urgent meeting with the leadership of the National Assembly for them to reconsider the gender bills.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nShe said the women will also use the following hashtags to push the demands on social media:\n\n#NigerianWomenOccupyNASS\n\n#BreakPoliticalBias\n\n#BreakConstitutionBias.\n\nDr Akiyode-Afolabi, who described what happened at the National Assembly on Tuesday as sad, stressed that the women will no longer take the discrimination against them lying low.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nShe said the protest will also take place across the various states of the federation but the meeting with the leadership of the National Assembly on Wednesday will determine the shape of what will happen at the state levels.\n\nDr Akiyode-Afolabi urged the media to support the women, saying the mobilisation has started already with several women and organisations within and outside Abuja overwhelmingly throwing their support behind the protest.\n\n\u2018We believe the constitution is a ground norm and the issue will be cleared with the constitution,\u2019 she said.\n\nThe statement reads in full:\n\n\u2018Nigeria women are disappointed and aggrieved at the actions of the 9th National Assembly (NASS) today Tuesday, March 1, 2022, when they denied women the opportunity of inclusion and representation in governance by voting against the gender bills.\n\n\u2018The NASS has spoken loud and clear that they do not want progress for society: for mothers, aunties, sisters, wives, and for daughters.\n\n\u2018It is particularly sad that in a month globally dedicated to celebrating women worldwide, our NASS has chosen to deny women basic human rights. These are rights enjoyed by every Nigerian except women.\n\n\u2018The proposed gender bills in the 5th Constitution Alteration Bills that were all rejected are Bills targeted at addressing the current gender imbalance across the legislative arm of governments across the country whilst reducing the under-representation of women in political office.\n\n\u2018The men of the 9th NASS have reinforced the discrimination and political bias against women as enshrined in the 1999 constitution by:\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

(While it allows Nigerian men\u2019s foreign-born wives to be awarded automatic citizenship).\n\n\u2018Denying Nigerian women indigeneity through marriage.\n\n\u2018Denying 35% appointed positions for women and settling for 20%.\n\n\u2018Denying women affirmative action in party administration and leadership.\n\n\u2018Denying specific seats for women in the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018The men of the 9th NASS by their actions have taken us backwards. Their actions undermine the importance and relevance of women\u2019s contribution to the governance of Nigeria including the key role women play to bring victory to political parties in elections at all levels across the country. They also voted against diaspora voting!\n\n\u2018Nigerian women, therefore, demand that all gender Bills be reconsidered. Ultimately, our demands will benefit not just women but Nigeria as a whole. \u201cMore women in governance will only bring progress, and respect for Nigeria in the committee of nations. We cannot, in 2022, be negotiating the rights of women and the sanctity of the dignity of girls.\n\n\u2018We call on the National Assembly to re-present these Bills as a matter of urgency and ensure that they are passed.\u2019\n\nLawmakers on Tuesday voted against a bill seeking to provide special seats for women in the National and State Houses of Assembly.\n\nThe bill was defeated in the Senate with 58 votes out of 91.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, 208 out of 290 lawmakers voted against it.\n\nHon Nkeiruka Onyejeocha (APC, Abia), a member of the House of Representatives, sponsored the bill, seeking to alter sections 48, 49, 71,77,91, and 117 of the 1999 constitution by creating an additional senatorial seat and two federal constituencies in each state and FCT for women.\n\nThis would have come down to creating 111 extra seats for women at the National Assembly.\n\nOne of the bills that suffered a similar fate was one that provided for 15% affirmative action for women in political party administration; 224 representatives voted yes while 77 voted no (failed to get 2/3rd majority). In the Senate, 33 voted Yes, while 53 voted No.\n\nAnother bill to allow women to take up the indigeneship of their husbands\u2019 state after 5 years of marriage failed at the House of Representatives. In the Senate, 90 senators voted Yes, five voted No. Because it failed in the House of Representatives, it remains failed.",

While the lower legislative chamber passed the bill with 286-1 votes, senate passed it with 83-1 votes.\n\nThe parliament dumped the bid to expand immunity to presiding officers of the National Assembly and the Chief Justice of Nigeria. Presently, only the president, vice-president, the 36 governors and deputies enjoy immunity.\n\nUsing the electronic voting system during plenary, 185 members of the House voted in favour of the bill while 111 voted against it \u2014 and five lawmakers abstained. At the upper legislative chamber, 50 senators voted against while 29 voted in favour of the bill.\n\nSimilarly, the assembly threw out the \u2018Bill For an Act to alter the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to provide for special seats for women in the national and state Houses of Assembly and for related matters.\u2019 While the House voted 81-208 to throw the bill out, the Senate had a 30-58 vote despite enjoying the backing of Aisha Buhari, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, and Dolapo Osinbajo, wife of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nIt also approved bills seeking to move electricity generation and distribution, airports, railways and prisons from the exclusive to concurrent list.

So, it is a good and welcome development.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the legislators for rejecting pension for the Senate presidents and Speakers, saying it is an abuse of office. He stated that pension should only be for civil servants and not politicians.\n\nReacting, National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, described autonomy for local government as the beginning of democracy.\n\nHe, however, stated that autonomy for local governments can work when there was no more local/state government joint account and when the state independent electoral commission stops conducting elections for local government.\n\nHe also commended the parliament for turning down the provision that could have allowed pension for Senate presidents and Speaker of the House of Representatives, saying there was no need for pension for them because they are not civil servants.\n\n\u201cThe senate can decide to churn out five senate presidents in one year. They are not civil servants; they have just been elected to serve for four years or eight years. However, there are certain facilities that should be provided for them but not pensions. Pension should only be given to the civil servants. So, I support them on that and I commend them,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident of the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima also described autonomy for LGAs as a good development because local governments play a major role in the lives of common people.\n\n\u201cAutonomy to local governments will make the people to be part and parcel of the governance process.\n\n\u201cAgain in terms of security, people will feel that they have a stake in it with autonomy to the local governments because people come from the community.

          "text": "\u2022South-east seeks national secretary, South-west divided\n\n\u2022Chairmanship aspirants disagree on convention date, write Buhari\n\n\u2022Governors agree on zoning list\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari met with governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday at State House, Abuja, where he expressed his preference for former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as consensus candidate for the office of APC national chairman.\n\nThe meeting with the state chief executives was called to discuss the forthcoming national convention of the party scheduled for March 26, among other issues.\n\nAPC stakeholders from the South-east pushed for the office of National Secretary, while the South-west, where the office was originally zoned, was still divided over the party position.\n\nHowever, under the latest agreement reached by the Governors yesterday at their meeting after the meeting with Buhari, all the previous positions in the party held by members from the North-west would now go to those from the South-east; all positions that were held by those in the North-east would go to those in the South-west; and all positions previously held by those from the North-central would automatically go to those from the South-south. Therefore, the position of party secretary and chairman were dealt with.\n\nIt was agreed that Adamu would be National Chairman.\n\nThe president\u2019s only preference was Adamu as National Chairman, and for the rest positions, he asked the stakeholders to go and decide.\n\nSome of the APC governors at the meeting wanted the March 26 date proposed for the party\u2019s national convention to remain as planned, but some aspirants for the party positions wrote to the president to halt plans for the convention.\n\nAlthough it would have been Buni\u2019s preferred plan to hold the convention and presidential primary same time, that is no longer feasible given INEC\u2019s timetable and time constraint.\n\nAt the meeting attended by 11 of the 22 APC governors at the president\u2019s office, Buhari was said to have turned down the governors\u2019 request for him to have a rethink on his support for Adamu as national chairman of the party.\n\nThe president, who met with the governors shortly before departing for Nairobi, Kenya, to attend a four-day international summit, said no to the attempt by the governors to get him to change his mind on the former Nasarawa State governor. He was said to have bluntly refused to shift ground, when the governors advanced their reasons against the ranking senator emerge as national chairman.\n\nThe governors were said to have expressed their desire to allow all those that have signified interest in the national chairmanship of the party to run, which the president rejected.\n\nThe engagement provided an avenue for South-east APC governors to complain about the zoning of the office of the national secretary to South-west rather than their region.\n\nChairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, who led the team to the meeting with Buhari, was said to have told them that it was too late to amend the zoning formula.\n\nIn spite of the position of the chairman of PGF, the South-east governors resolved to take their agitation for the party scribe to a meeting of the APC governors that was scheduled to hold next Tuesday at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja.\n\nThe Tuesday evening\u2019s meeting, expected to be attended by the 22 APC governors, will take another look at the totality of the forthcoming national convention with regard to the zoning arrangement for the offices.\n\nApart from Bagudu, other APC governors at the meeting were Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Aminu Masari (Katsina), Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Hope Uzodinma (Imo), Gboyega Oyetola (Osun), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Sani Bello (Niger), Umar Ganduje (Kano), and outing deputy governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke.\n\nBuni absent at meeting\n\nAt the end of the meeting with Buhari, the governors affirmed that there was no plan to move the national convention from the scheduled date of March 26, in Abuja. This was despite the tight timeframe provided by the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) released for next year\u2019s general election.\n\nThere had been speculations that a section of the party was pushing for the postponement of the national convention so that both the election of the national executives and the primaries to select its candidates for the 2023 elections could be done simultaneously.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after the meeting with the president, Bagudu assured that the party would maintain the March 26 date for the exercise. He said the governors met with the president to congratulate him for signing the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and also on the victory of APC in some of the by-elections conducted over the weekend.\n\nOn whether the idea of further postponement of the convention was discussed at the meeting, Bagudu stated, \u201cLast week, we were in this hall (villa), about 20 APC governors, and this question came up and we clearly said we came to discuss the national convention, which is slated for March 26, and are working hard to ensure that on March 26, we have our convention and elect our national officers and that remains the case.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed speculation that the APC state chief executives were still divided over the direction of the party especially, after what seemed to be an altercation among them as they emerged from the meeting with the president.\n\nBagudu stated, \u201cThere\u2019s no altercation, I\u2019m not aware of any. Mallam Nasiru (Kaduna State governor), again last week, answered that. Look, if by altercation people are talking about differences of opinion before a decision is arrived at, then, maybe, that is what people can\u2026 but as a body, the 22 governors of APC are united behind the party and behind Mr. President.\u201d\n\nOn the essence of the meeting on Tuesday, Bagudu explained, \u201cToday, Tuesday, 1st of March, a number of APC governors came to Mr. President to, among others, congratulate him on signing the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThis is something many Nigerians have expressed different views about, but Mr. President had once again taken the courageous step of, even while having observations, he signed and requested the National Assembly to look at it. So, we congratulate the National Assembly for passage of the amendments and equally congratulate Mr. President for signing the amendment.\n\n\u201cSecondly, our party, the All Progressives Congress, participated in a number of by-elections over the last weekend and equally, we congratulated Mr. President and in addition, we spoke about other issues that concern our party.\u201d\n\nBagudu dismissed insinuations that governors were still not comfortable with certain provisions of the Act, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve always had cause to address this. There was no time; legislation, everywhere in the world, is based on continuous improvement. Constitutions that are 200 years old are subject to reviews sometimes and those reviews are not cut and dry. Even people, who truly believe in the need for legislation may have worries about the implications of it.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we\u2019re never against the principle of amending laws. They (governors) are never against the National Assembly, but even among the National Assembly, there\u2019s debate. To imagine that there is some legislation that is punitive to the governors or to the National Assembly, I think that will be tantamount to negation of the Oath of Office, whoever is participating in doing that.\u201d\n\nAccording to a senior official of the APC caretaker committee, \u201cAs you know, our party is already fragmented along different interest groups. It is expected that there will be serious crisis within the party after the national convention fixed for March 26. And we don\u2019t have enough time to resolve the crisis before the presidential primary that will start on April 4.\n\n\u201cSo, our reasoning is that if we hold the national convention and presidential primary same day, we will have almost eight months to resolve the crises that will emanate from both the national convention and the presidential primary before the campaign starts \u2013 in line with INEC\u2019s timetable.\u201d\n\nThe APC chieftain added that almost all members of the interim committee and some governors had keyed into this news idea, saying it would be \u201csuicidal for the party to go ahead\u201d with the national convention fixed for March 26.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is to see how we can manage our crisis. We don\u2019t want to have a sharply divided party that will be going into campaign and elections. And we hope to present this case to our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, for approval in the next few days.\u201d\n\nAnother source also claimed that the fresh plot to hold the national convention and the presidential primary same day had always been the \u201cagenda\u201d of Buni-led caretaker committee.\n\nThe source said, \u201cWe are aware of the new move by some members of the caretaker committee. That has always been their agenda. They really want to conduct the presidential primary and the convention the same day, so that they can benefit from it. Let\u2019s see how it goes.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a group under the auspices of All Progressive Congress (APC) Action Group demanded that the presidential primary and the national convention of APC be held on the same date.\n\nThe group, in a statement yesterday by its Publicity Secretary, Mr. Bisi Olanipekun, said there was need to save money for the party and to shield party members from expending so much resources for the two events that could be held in a day.\n\nAspirants Write Buhari, Want National Convention Halted\n\nThe Forum of All Progressive Congress (APC) Aspirants for National Convention wrote to President Muhammadu Buhari and urged him to halt the forthcoming national convention of the party slated for March 26. The aspirants, in the letter jointly signed yesterday by the forum\u2019s President and Secretary, Mr. Tolulope Ashafa and Mr. Usman Adamu, respectively, alleged that four APC governors were planning to bring the convention forward by holding it earlier than planned.\n\nThe aspirants said the development would make the APC unable to give the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) the 30-day notice required by law for it to hold the convention.\n\nThe forum said the prediction that the Electoral Act 2022 would cause the demise of APC was anchored not on the content of the legislation but the unholy manipulations going on in the party.\n\nThe forum stated, \u201cWe crave your patience to recall the near toxic wrangling over the timing of APC\u2019s National Convention. But for the wisdom of Mr. President, who sided with critical stakeholders on the need to hold the convention at a more auspicious time, a gang of state governors had arrogated the power of decision to themselves and were going to force the gathering through without minding the consequences on the party, the country\u2019s democracy, and Your Excellency\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufai, Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State are among the members of the cartel that has put its interest over that of our great party by trying to forcefully conduct the convention in a manner that would have sabotaged the APC but for your timely intervention.\u201d\n\nThe forum alleged that these governors were exploiting the names of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and the president to promote one candidate above the others in a manner that completely negated the neutrality that the president had embodied in the handling of political decisions in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Senate passes 49 out of 68 constitution bills\n\n\u2022Moves prisons, railways, power generation from exclusive to concurrent list\n\n\u2022Rejects pension for parliament presiding officers\n\n\u2022Says states free to collect VAT\n\n\u2022Empowers NASS, state assemblies to summon president, govs\n\n\u2022 Turns down proposal for special seats for women in legislature\n\n\u2022Okays independent candidature for elections\n\n\u2022 Approves separation of AGF, Justice Minister offices\n\nSunday Aborisade, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nMembers of the National Assembly yesterday voted on the report of its Joint Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution (Fifth Alteration) Bills, 2022, which consisted of 68 bills.\n\nThe Senate passed a total of 49 bills out of the 68 considered during voting on the Constitution bills. These included moving prisons, railways and power generation from the Exclusive to Concurrent list.\n\nAlso, the federal lawmakers at the end of the exercise, approved financial autonomy for state legislatures, judiciary and local governments (LGs) in the country.\n\nThe eight National Assembly had during the amendment carried out on the 1999 Constitution, passed similar bills to empower the LGs, state legislature and the judiciary, but could not scale through when they were transmitted to the state assemblies for concurrence.\n\nProbably disturbed by the development, President Muhammadu Buhari had on Friday, May 23, 2020, signed into law an Executive Order to grant financial autonomy to the legislature and the judiciary across the 36 states of the country. The order also mandated the Accountant-General of the federation to deduct from source amount due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation to each state for states that refuse to grant such autonomy.\n\nThe Executive Order No. 10 of 2020, made it mandatory that all states of the federation should include the allocations of both the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets.\n\nThe Attorney-General for the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami had said a Presidential Implementation Committee had been constituted to fashion out strategies and modalities for the implementation of financial autonomy for the State Legislature and State Judiciary in compliance with section 121(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as Amended).\n\nHe had also said consideration was given to all other applicable laws, instruments, conventions and regulations that provided for financial autonomy at the states.\n\nHowever, in a split decision of six Justices to one, the Supreme Court, had on February 12, 2022, nullified Executive Order 10 initiated by Buhari to grant financial autonomy to the State Judiciary and legislature.\n\nThe apex court had held that Executive Order 10 was inconsistent with the 1999 Constitution and therefore unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect\n\nHowever, civil society organisations led by the Executive Director of Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, who monitored proceedings at the National Assembly yesterday, expressed mixed feelings over the development\n\nRafsanjani said, \u201cWe in the CSOs are really not excited over the issue. We believe that the governors would once again influence the state legislature to reject the bills despite the fact that it would be in their favour.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the lawmakers during the session witnessed by the wife of the President, Hajia Aishat Buhari and the wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, rejected bills to empower women in politics.\n\nThey equally turned down attempt to empower presiding officers of the legislature to enjoy life pension.\n\nThe federal lawmakers equally rejected bills to provide for the removal of presiding officers of the legislature; and to change the name of Barikin Ladi Local Government Area in Plateau State to \u201cGwol\u201d Local Government Area.\n\nBoth Senate and House of Representatives Special Ad Hoc Committees on the Review of the 1999 Constitution, last week laid its report and recommended 68 amendments.\n\nThe recommendations were based on private members, executive bills and memoranda received from the public during its zonal public hearings. Out of the 360 members in the House, as at commencement of voting, 290 members were present in the chambers.\n\nWhile one voted against, 286 voted in support of the bill to alter the provisions of the constitution to abrogate the state joint local government account and provide for a special account into which shall be paid all Allocations due to LGs from the Federation Account and from the Government of the State, surpassing 240, the two third majority needed for the passage.\n\nAlso, 258 members voted in support of the Bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the to establish LG as a tier of Government and Guarantee their Democratic Existence and Tenure.\n\nFor the Financial Independence of State Houses of Assembly and State Judiciary, 296 members voted in favour of the proposal.\n\nThe lawmakers also voted in favour of establishing the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and of the State to separate it from the office of the Minister of Justice or Commissioner for Justice for State in order to make the offices of the Attorney General independent and insulated from partisanship. While 259 voted in support, 44 voted against.\n\nFurthermore, 269 lawmakers voted in support of independent candidacy in presidential, governorship, National Assembly, State Houses of Assembly and local government council elections.\n\nThey also approved a bill to provide for the Office of Mayor for the Federal Capital Territory Administration Abuja. 245 lawmakers voted in support while 53 voted against.\n\nIn a similar vein, majority of members approved the Bills for Acts to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution to Change the names of Afikpo North and Afikpo South Local Government Areas; Kunchi Local Government Area; Egbado North and Egbado South Local Government Areas; Barikin Ladi Local Government Area; Atigbo Local government Area; Obia/Akpor Local Government Area; and for Related Matters.\n\nOther proposals the lawmakers voted in support of included, \u201ca bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Move Airports from Exclusive Legislative List to the Concurrent Legislative List, a Bill to Establish State Security Council; and for Related Matters, to Empower the National Assembly and State House of Assembly Powers to Summon the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Governors of States to answer Questions on issues on which the National and State Assembly have the Power to make Law, a Bill to reduce the period within which the President or the Governor of a State may authorize the withdrawal of Monies from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in the absence of an Appropriation Act from six months to three months.\n\n\u201cTo provide for the State of the Nation and State Address by the President and Governor; and for Related Matters. To include former Heads of the National Assembly in the council of state; and for Related Matters. To provide for the Termination of Tenure of certain Elected officials on Account of change of political party; and for Related Matters. To enhance existing provisions on the formation of political parties.\u201d\n\nRejected Bills\n\nOn the other hand, the National Assembly turned down the Bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide Pension for Presiding Officers of the National Assembly. While 102 lawmakers voted in support, 103 voted against the recommendation which would have made the current Senate President, Lawan and Speaker, Gbajabiamila and their Deputies beneficiaries.\n\nThey also rejected the Bill for an Act to Alter Part I of the Second Schedule to the Constitution to include Value Added Tax (VAT) on the Exclusive Legislative list.\n\nVAT issue has been in contention between the federal and state governments over who should be collecting it and how it should be shared. In all, 209 members voted against it, while only 91 voted in support, thereby taking it out of the purview of only the federal government.\n\nThe lawmakers, sadly killed three bills seeking more inclusion of women in elective positions. The bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide for Special Seat for Women in the National and State Houses of Assembly, had 208 members voting against the amendment with only 81 supporting.\n\nSimilarly, the second bill seeking for Affirmative Action for Women in Political Party Administration was equally rejected by majority of the lawmakers despite appeals by the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nDuring consideration of the bill, PDP lawmakers Bamidele Salam from Osun state and Dachung Bagos from Plateau state, suggested that the 35 per cent affirmative action should be reduced to 15 per cent.\n\nWhile 195 lawmakers agreed with Salam\u2019s amendment, 107 voted against it. Gbajabiamila called for repetition of the process appealing to his colleagues to support the bill, saying women are the ones that come out en masse to vote during elections. However, his appeals were not heeded to and he thereafter vowed to expose those who voted against women bills.\n\nHe said, \u201cFollowing existing statistics it is women that come out en masse to vote. It is the same women who come out in mass to vote for us. You are now here voting against their interest? I am going to publish those who voted against this particular bill.\u201d\n\nThe third bill seeking to provide for a Minimum Percentage for Women in Ministerial or Commissioner Nominees was also rejected by the Lawmakers, despite pleas from Gbajabiamila, the Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu and Chairman Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson for them to support the Bill.\n\nThe Speaker, however amended that 20 per cent should be given to Women for ministerial, commissioner nominees regardless of Nays scream from the lawmakers.\n\nThe House further voted against itself on a bill to provide the procedure for overriding executive veto in respect of money bills. While 284 voted for, 10 voted against. 288 votes that is 4/5 was required to pass the Bill.\n\nThe lawmakers also rejected bill to provide for Diaspora Voting. 240 lawmakers voted against while 59 voted in support.\n\nThe bill to expand immunity to the legislative and Judicial Arms of Government was equally rejected.\n\nEarlier, majority of the lawmakers kicked against move to usher in Dolapo Osinbajo to witness voting on the bills up for consideration in the Constitution Amendment.\n\nGbajabiamila who presided over the session had called on the House Leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa to suspend relevant rules of the House and moved that the VP\u2019s wife should be ushered in to witness the proceedings.\n\nThis generated screams of Nays from lawmakers across party lines. However, the Speaker cautioned his colleagues particularly the PDP lawmakers for kicking against it.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cHon. Chinda and co, the fact that I referred you guys as smaller parties doesn\u2019t mean you should scream no.\u201d\n\nHe, thereafter put the decision to usher in the Vice President\u2019s Wife to voice vote, despite the Nays having it, he gave it to the Ayes and the directed the House Leader, to usher in the Vice President\u2019s wife.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I can tell you that clearly. I believe the two traditional rulers intend to reach out to him later,\u201d Rahman said.\n\n\u201cBut let me say this clearly: Asiwaju Tinubu has tremendous respect for the traditional institution and particularly for the two eminent royal fathers.\n\n\u201cYou would recall that only recently during his consultations and engagements with traditional rulers and other stakeholders in Oyo and Osun states on his presidential aspiration, he visited and interfaced with HRM Iku Baba Yeye Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, and HRM Onirisa, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, in their respective domains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you ask me what Asiwaju\u2019s attitude would be to the reconciliation move, of course he would welcome and support it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that Asiwaju and the Hon. minister of interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, are from the same political family. As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa appointed him commissioner for works for eight years during his time as Lagos governor.\n\n\u201cHe also later drafted him into the Osun governorship race and supported him to be governor in Osun for eight years.\n\n\u201cI think Asiwaju would factor all of that and where both of them are coming from into the reconciliation efforts. He would not oppose the idea.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable had reported that plans were underway to facilitate Tinubu and Aregbesola\u2019s reconciliation.\n\nIn June 2020, TheCable reported that the relationship between the duo had turned sour \u2014 but they both denied the report.\n\nThe rift began in May 2020, when Aregbesola arbitrarily revamped the Mandate Group \u2014 a core of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists \u2014 and usurped the closely-knitted caucus for individuals he could trust.",

I can tell you that clearly. I believe the two traditional rulers intend to reach out to him later,\u201d Rahman said.\n\n\u201cBut let me say this clearly: Asiwaju Tinubu has tremendous respect for the traditional institution and particularly for the two eminent royal fathers.\n\n\u201cYou would recall that only recently during his consultations and engagements with traditional rulers and other stakeholders in Oyo and Osun states on his presidential aspiration, he visited and interfaced with HRM Iku Baba Yeye Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, and HRM Onirisa, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, in their respective domains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you ask me what Asiwaju\u2019s attitude would be to the reconciliation move, of course he would welcome and support it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that Asiwaju and the Hon. minister of interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, are from the same political family. As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa appointed him commissioner for works for eight years during his time as Lagos governor.\n\n\u201cHe also later drafted him into the Osun governorship race and supported him to be governor in Osun for eight years.\n\n\u201cI think Asiwaju would factor all of that and where both of them are coming from into the reconciliation efforts. He would not oppose the idea.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable had reported that plans were underway to facilitate Tinubu and Aregbesola\u2019s reconciliation.\n\nIn June 2020, TheCable reported that the relationship between the duo had turned sour \u2014 but they both denied the report.\n\nThe rift began in May 2020, when Aregbesola arbitrarily revamped the Mandate Group \u2014 a core of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists \u2014 and usurped the closely-knitted caucus for individuals he could trust.",

          "title": "Development finance institutions are looking to Africa\u2019s digital frontier for impact and returns",
          "text": "Development finance institutions have long funded traditional finance and infrastructure projects in Africa; now they\u2019re increasingly backing Africa\u2019s digital future. What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurial stories are told using various narratives, which all have two things in common: It\u2019s not a walk in the park. It\u2019s not for the faint-hearted. While some founders have a clearly defined path that segues into a completely different trajectory, bearing with it the tide for a business idea, others stumble upon entrepreneurship.\n\nFor Oluwatobi Odukoya, CDcare Co-founder/CEO, and Ayodeji Farohun, Co-founder/COO, the journey to building CDcare was a combination of the influence of a father who ran a local credit platform in their community, an academic environment that fostered entrepreneurial spirits, and his knack for solving problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDcare Co-founders(L-R): Oluwatobi Odukoya (CEO), and Ayodeji Farohun (COO)\n\nCDcare is an online marketplace that lets users shop for gadgets, home appliances, and electronics at regular market prices with the option of paying in instalments at no interest rate. It all began when Odukoya was a 100 level chemical engineering student at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Il\u00e9-if\u1eb9\u0300, Southwest Nigeria.\n\nThe seed for the idea was planted as he watched his mom save up for months to get him his first laptop. He decided to start a Loan-a-Laptop scheme in the university\u2019s environs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy mom saved for roughly over eight months to get me my first laptop. In school, I saw that this was something most parents did too. And having assisted my father while he managed a microfinance society back home, I sort of had early exposure to credit systems. So I started with laptops. I\u2019d help students buy laptops, and they\u2019d pay little by little.\u201d\n\nBut his entrepreneurial sprint began a year after getting into the university. He pioneered a small business that helped fellow students secure important files even after formatting their computers.\n\n\u201cBefore getting into OAU, I had never sat down in front of a computer. Upon coming in contact with one, I started learning to fix small hardware faults. This was the discovery of my knack for solving problems. In year one, I discovered that final year students lost their projects to small viruses. So I decided to research and come up with a way to fix this. With the help of my brother\u2019s Internet connection and computer, I found a way to format computers without people losing their files.\u201d\n\nOdukoya shares that the OAU environment encouraged entrepreneurial pursuits, which significantly contributed to the growth of the computer repair business.\n\n\u201cOAU has a very supportive community. There were students in school who survived selling pure water and groundnuts to fellow students. When you start a business, everyone would suddenly begin to patronise you rather than an outsider.\u201d\n\nGraduates who left the boundaries of Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0301 for the job market recommended him to the companies they worked in to fix their computers. They opened a Lagos branch to cut out the challenge of transporting these computers from Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300 to Lagos.\n\n\u201cAs my business grew, I started training other indigenes so that I could focus on school. Recently, I sold off the OAU arm of that business. The Lagos arm is still known as Computer Doctor today. Our clients include top fintechs like Paystack and Flutterwave. We were able to land these clients thanks to people who patronised us in school and then recommended us to their companies after graduating,\u201d he adds.\n\nRunning CDcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatobi Odukoya, CDcare Co-founder/CEO\n\nAlthough the Loan-a-Laptop scheme started as a stint at school, it was already a full-fledged business affiliated with his Computer Doctor operations by 2013, around Odukoya\u2019s final year in the university. Landing a partnership with a big distribution company was his big break.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had been going about my regular computer business dealings with the Loan a Laptop scheme when I met Adedeji, who currently is my co-founder. We were classmates and became friends after he purchased a laptop from me, and we began co-running the scheme. A few years into this, we got a partnership with Fouani. We\u2019d been dealing with them for the scheme because we delved into electronics and appliances and had gotten enough units to be partners. So we decided to start CDcare.\u201d\n\nBecause he couldn\u2019t afford a developer, Odukoya had to learn to use Flutter, a software design kit with ready-to-use codes and tools to build websites and apps developed by Google.\n\nFouani Nigeria Ltd is a subsidiary of Fouani Group, licensed distributors of electronic appliances made by LG and Hisense. This partnership meant Odukoya and his partner could make bulk purchases at a discount. Today, they partner with other companies, including Apple Nigeria, Scanfrost, Vitafoam, and Haier Thermocool.\n\nHow CDcare works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDcare homepage\n\nAlthough not as mainstream today, given the presence of established financial institutions, the concept of community-based savings schemes in Nigeria dates back to the country\u2019s pre-colonial era. Individuals came together to make daily/weekly monetary contributions with a reputable person in charge of recording the funds and providing credit financing when needed.\n\nOdukoya emphasises that CDcare is not a fintech platform but rather an online marketplace that allows people to buy goods by paying in small chunks for up to 12 months and receive the goods after the first half has been paid at zero interest rate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple; we offer a \u2018pay small small for gadgets and appliances with zero interest\u2019, and at normal market price. Our users collect their items in the middle of the instalment period. Depending on your income frequency, we have between two months and 12-month instalments. CDcare can be seen as a better way to save up and buy something. And because we have our marketplace, it is easy to ensure quality.\u201d\n\nFor context, a user gets their item shipped after the first instalment for a two-month plan. As a perk for consistent users, the platform also offers a feature where buyers can get their items shipped and delivered after the first payment for a three-month plan. This added feature is called CDcare3. The CDcare app is available on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, and also as a web application.\n\nIt will not be out of place to wonder why CDcare runs a zero-interest and normal market price model, unlike other Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) schemes with varying business models like QuickBucks, Carbon Zero, Specta, AltMall, etc., but Odukoya reveals the reasoning behind this.\n\n\u201cLoan companies in Nigeria are missing out on a nuance in the Nigerian populace. It might not be a big factor, but it is something. Nigeria has a lot of Muslims, and interest schemes are like a taboo in Islam.\n\n\u201cSo, one reason we have a lot of northern customers is the zero interest rate. Another factor is the African aversion to credit. Owing is seen as a shameful thing in most Nigerian communities, so this model makes the buyers feel like they\u2019re saving to buy rather than the feeling of taking a loan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, CDcare had sold over 15,000 products to over 7,000 people across Nigeria. For many of its customers, the question is always how does the platform make money given the model it operates.\n\n\u201cA lot of people wonder how we make money. We\u2019re leveraging the fact that most people would rather save up and buy at a normal market price than take out a loan and pay interest. Also, our partnerships with companies help us control the quality of goods, which boosts our user base. We get goods at very discounted prices, so we can sell at a reasonable price without tampering with the market price,\u201d Odukoya says.\n\nHe also adds that aside from an angel investment of $10,000, they have neither started an investment round nor received any financing from external sources. Although, he acknowledges that investments will speed up their current 20% month-on-month growth.\n\n\u201cWe are open to investments because there are a lot of plans in place that only adequate funding can help us carry out. We are currently speaking to investors and trying to raise funds. However, I believe that the amount of time spent trying to convince an investor can be spent sitting down to convince a customer. The success we have achieved so far is due to a relentless and dedicated team and word-of-mouth from our customers. Our focus right now is on getting more customers.\u201d\n\nChallenges so far\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the online retail business, the issue of trust on the part of both sellers and buyers cannot be over flogged. This was a significant challenge when CDcare started, and Odukoya believes that trust is a two-way thing in eCommerce.\n\n\u201cWhen we started, getting people to trust us was quite a challenge, and to solve this, we started posting products like kettles and other cheap items after users purchased them, and it got to them as they ordered, they would then come back to buy products like MacBooks, deep freezers, and more expensive gadgets.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, there are times that we have had to go to people\u2019s homes to retrieve products due to defaults in payments. We also issue a loan receipt that signifies payment deficit when the items are sent at the middle of their payment plan.\u201d\n\nHe also shares that solving the logistics was an issue, and at some point, all the company\u2019s profit was going into shipping products. They have solved this by partnering with logistics companies and charging delivery fees on goods.\n\nA familiar saying among Nigerians goes thus: problem no dey finish. This can be loosely translated as \u2018tough times are an inevitable part of life.\u2019 Odukoya shares that there have been challenges at several phases in CDcare\u2019s life, challenges he believes are bound to come up as the business grows.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, it was the issue of building the app as we couldn\u2019t afford to pay a developer; I leant Flutter, and we solved that. Then there were some payment issues, which a partnership with Flutterwave helped us sort out. And as we expand, it is expected that challenges like the speed of our response time, managing logistics, and many more, most unforeseen. But as we get to these points, we will figure out a way to sort them out.\u201d\n\nLooking at the future; growth plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction is to startups what wind is to ship sails. It is one of the most vital phases in a startup\u2019s life cycle, and for Odukoya and his team, one near growth plan is product expansion, with the closest being vehicles and home purchases.\n\n\u201cBy 2022, we intend to start selling cars on CDcare, and I would like to put it out that we would love to partner with brands like Innoson Motors and Toyota to make this happen. Most Nigerians settle for Tokunbo because there\u2019s really no way to \u2018buy and pay small small\u2019 for cars. We also want to partner with real estate companies such that you can start making payments for a house at say age 25 and save up with us to own it at, say, 35.\u201d\n\nFor geographical expansion, he shares that a foray to other African countries is in sight, and advancement into Ghana is in the works. However, the big picture is getting the CDcare marketplace to the doorstep of the average African, online and offline.\n\n\u201cOur big vision is getting CDcare to a point where that mechanic on the road can get a small Nokia phone from us, that welder can get a small generator to make his work easier, and the mom/dad can get a blender to make grinding the tomatoes easier. As we speak, we have begun building the framework for this, and it is being experimented.\u201d\n\n\n\nFun fact: I got my current cell phone on CDcare, and I must say, the service is seamless!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost everyone you know probably has a delivery hiccup story. Whether it is the dispatch rider refusing to pick up your calls or never arriving with your parcel or the dispatch company reacting very rudely when you call to complain, making that call to use logistics services is always fraught with several challenges.\n\nBut you can\u2019t avoid using these last-mile delivery services. From your Jumia Food deliveries to your CDcare purchases, they\u2019ve become quite integral to our everyday lives. Before now, we mostly used these companies to receive correspondence and large parcels \u2014 like the ones we receive from uncles abroad. But the growth of eCommerce has caused an exponential growth in demand.\n\nAccording to Visa\u2019s eCommerce developments across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) report, the global eCommerce sector is projected to grow to $7 trillion by 2024. South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya are leading the pack in Africa, and with McKinsey\u2019s predictions of a $75 billion African market by 2025, the only place now is up.\n\nHowever, although projections are all good and fine, they do not exactly solve the present-day challenges we mentioned earlier. How do you cut down the wait time between dispatch and delivery? And perhaps \u2014 to round it up \u2014 how do you reduce customer and dispatch company headache stories?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCutting down wait time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early 2021, Babajide Padonu, Kolawole Roberts, and Oluwasegun Aderibigbe met to discuss several things. Padonu had worked under Aderibigbe at a previous company and had struck up a friendship. Roberts met Padonu through Aderibigbe and the boat set sail.\n\nIt started as a joke and perhaps an avenue to vent about frustrations caused by dispatch riders, but soon the idea to form Flashbike went from jokester territory to serious business.\n\nThe idea was simple: create a platform that aggregates dispatch riders, enables tracking, and works as quickly as a ride-hailing business.\n\nIt took seven months to churn out a workable iteration and by November 2021, Flashbike was live on Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nLike so many people, they had experienced their fair share of disappointments with delivery companies.\n\nSpeaking to his own experience, Padonu said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of [sic]. I\u2019ve tried to send parcels and they take a long time to come. Or the rider promises that they are going to come and they don\u2019t come or after they\u2019ve promised, they don\u2019t pick your call anymore after you\u2019ve discussed everything. So, it was just very frustrating.\u201d\n\nIt was Aderibigbe who first came up with the idea of an app, and as discussions continued, issues like funding and what exactly this would solve emerged. So research began and as Padonu told Techpoint Africa on a call, they discovered a huge gap: long wait times in pickup and delivery.\n\nAccording to this article on Benjamindada.com comparing wait time for four delivery startups in Lagos, while delivery usually occurs on the same day, wait time for pickup and delivery varied. For some, it took an hour, for others, it arrived the next day \u2014 based on certain extenuating circumstances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlashbike\u2019s model aggregates dispatch companies to provide a pick-up service with the user given the option to pick whichever is closest to them.\n\nWhat this means is that, say Padonu resides in Lekki and wishes to deliver a dress to his mother in Surulere, he can open the app, set the pickup and delivery location, and he could find a dispatch rider as close as 10 km away with a wait time of between 15 \u2013 20 minutes.\n\nInitially the idea was to create an instant service, but due to a lack of riders, they had to manage expectations.\n\nCarving out a different route\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlashbike Co-founders. Source: Supplied\n\nUnlike most other competitors, Flashbike has chosen a different model. Rather than onboarding riders individually, the company employs more of a B2B model which involves introducing the platform to traditional or small-time dispatch companies with little to no tech incorporated in their business.\n\nSo, think of this as a Fiverr but for dispatch companies.\n\nIn some ways, this serves to mitigate the risk that Flashbike incurs, reducing issues with bike repairs and maintenance, preventing possible direct regulatory hits \u2014 although this is arguable \u2014 and training riders on customer satisfaction.\n\nHowever, they still have to contend with customer satisfaction and Padonu described a scenario where a user waited for several hours before receiving their package. Although the situation was eventually addressed, it involved quite a bit of back and forth.\n\nTo prevent situations like this, Padonu advised that users try other riders on the app. He said occurrences like this are mostly caused by shady riders.\n\nInterestingly, Padonu said the app is free for now, a decision that has helped with onboarding logistics companies.\n\n\u201cIn conversation with people where I tell them, \u2018This is what we have, and we\u2019d love you to come onboard,\u2019 they\u2019ll usually ask questions like, \u2018How much are we paying?\u2019 But when you tell them that it is free they are ready to hop in.\u201d\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t always convert to actual users, he says, as sometimes they might download the app and not use it. A phenomenon that is not entirely uncommon.\n\nDue to the model the company uses, Flashbike doesn\u2019t determine pricing. This is usually determined by the exchange between the customer and the logistics company. An option that is quite attractive for the companies.\n\nAnother attractive feature for these companies is the ability to track riders.\n\n\u201cIf you own a company, you can see whatever your rider has done on your own app. As an owner, you would see how many requests your rider has had for the day, the ones that he fulfilled or not. That was one catch they all liked. Because sometimes, some riders can be shady and go and do their own stuff and you can\u2019t monitor them, unless you have the money to put a tracker on your bike. Putting a tracker on five bikes is expensive.\u201d\n\nThe ordinary user also has the option of live-tracking a rider, an option which is also available to other logistics companies like Kwik Delivery.\n\nAlthough there are plans to eventually include a payment method, the idea is to focus on solving the problem before implementing payment.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen in the past with logistics startups, freebies sometimes come back to haunt them.\n\nPadonu, however, said that they inform companies of their intention to monetise the app as they are onboarded.\n\nMapping out the next phase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom what Padonu told us, there\u2019s quite a lot planned.\n\nApart from implementing payments \u2014 perhaps through subscription by the companies \u2014 Flashbike wants to run ads for the logistics companies. Due to the fact that the company is still mostly in beta, Padonu said features are being added based on demand and workability.\n\nThe team packs a range of experience from running previous companies and in cyber security, system analytics, system engineering, and graphic design.\n\nIntriguingly, Flashbike is in no hurry to raise funds, being currently financed by family and friends. Although Padonu said the company has been approached by investors, they want to double down and work on the app before seeking any type of finance.\n\nCurrently, there are plans to expand beyond Lagos and into Abuja by the second quarter of 2022, Port-harcourt by the third quarter, Ghana by the fourth quarter, and Kenya by the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruck Transit Parks (TTP) limited (Ltd), an innovative traffic management company leveraging technology to help decongest Nigerian ports, celebrated its first anniversary and unveiled its new brand on February 28, 2022.\n\nBolaji Akerele, head of corporate development, TTP Ltd, opened the event, welcomed the attendees, and briefed the audience on the journey so far.\n\nHe said that intensive research was done to solve truck traffic and congestion in and around ports, and technology was sourced as the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Bolaji admitted that the past year had been a work in progress for them and their stakeholders: the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA), Lagos State Government (LSG), truck owners and drivers, transport unions, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said they work in line with the plans of the NPA and LSG.\n\nThe next speaker, Richard Emenim, executive assistant to the managing director (MD) of TTP Ltd, gave an overview of the previous year, emphasising the milestones achieved and challenges faced.\n\nOver one year, TTP Ltd has had 9563 registered users, 592780 processed truck bookings, 83531 registered trucks, and 85 approved park facilities. TTP Ltd has been able to help decongest ports and improve access to ports through its proprietary booking app known as \u00c8t\u00f2.\n\nThey have also reduced the cost of moving cargo to and from the port and improved truck throughput efficiency. The ICT solutions offered by TTP Ltd brings ease to trucking operations.\n\nThere have also been challenges; however, TTP Ltd reiterated its resolve to providing lasting solutions to challenges affecting the smooth running of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong these challenges is ineffective enforcement of the call-up system, extortion of drivers by security operatives, thugs, etc., multiple checkpoints, turning away trucks with valid \u00c8t\u00f2 booking tickets, low daily admission of empty containers into the port, and ticket racketeering.\n\nThe proposed solutions to these challenges were presented, most involving working with the NPA, LSG and other stakeholders.\n\nA short documentary by Jama Onwubuariri, the managing director of TTP, discussed the journey so far for TTP Ltd, its importance, and other plans to expand to other ports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Ayo Duruwaiye, the assistant general manager (AGM) operations, Nigerian port authority (NPA), congratulated TTP Ltd; however, he also said pressing issues require attention. He charged TTP Ltd to listen to what their customers are saying as it is a good way to appraise success.\n\nHe highlighted some of the challenges that still require attention and charged TTP Ltd to perform traffic management analysis concerning the numbers they record at the waterfront.\n\nMr Duruwaiye ended by saying that \u201cwe have moved a little bit, but we are not at the point where we should clink glasses.\u201d He said that the NPA would need TTP Ltd to work on the deliverables.\n\nHonorable Shola Giwa representing the Lagos State Government (LSG), discussed the importance of the collaboration between TTP Ltd, NPA and the LSG. He also called for more attention to the issues facing Tin can island. He said focus should not be only on Apapa port.\n\nHe called on the stakeholders to work together, be orderly patriotic and do things right to get things right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Jama Onwubuariri, MD TTP, spoke on the forward steps for TTP Ltd. These steps include complimentary services, helping drivers optimize, improving communications, and increasing engagement with terminal operators. He said that the number of offloaded cargo matters at the end.\n\nMr Onwubuariri gave more insight on \u00c8t\u00f2, their booking app. With \u00c8t\u00f2, truck drivers can book parking spaces at the Lilypond Pre-gate terminal or any satellite parking spaces affiliated with TTP Ltd. This booking service also affords truck drivers entry into the port as their ticket is scanned for confirmation.\n\nThe unveiling of the new brand logo signifying progression was launched by Mr Jama Owubuariri, Mr Ayo Durowaiye, Mr Shola Giwa, Mr Bolaji Akerele and others.\n\nA tour of the lilypond container terminal was held shortly after the launch with visits to the control room, booking center, and container terminal park, among others.\n\nIn a question and answer session, Mr Onwubuariri highlighted that the tech behind TTP Ltd is a mobility and booking solution. It is relatively homegrown because of the unique traffic problem in Nigeria. He also said that this solution is presently being used for truck traffic management. The solution can also be applied to passenger traffic.\n\nIt can be modified to enable the movement of buses, trains, and boats. TTP Ltd is looking at expanding the scope of what this solution and its derivatives can give in terms of vehicular parking, not just truck parking.\n\nThe MD recognised the importance of feedback from customers and other stakeholders, confirmed they found ways to solve customer complaints in the past, and reiterated TTP\u2019s commitment to getting better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs regards the future, the MD sees TTP Ltd transforming from a traffic management company to a tech solution company. He said that diversifying the areas where they provide support and solutions to businesses is an approach they are adopting consciously.\n\nTruck Transit Parks Limited is a traffic management company that leverages technology and man-management systems to ease traffic challenges. They provide a cost-effective, physical and technologically secure network of truck parking services in Nigeria.\n\nLeveraging experience and research, TTP Ltd have designed a system that manages truck traffic issues within the country.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "While Seplat Energy Plc, a major energy company in Nigeria, has agreed to buy the shallow-water assets of ExxonMobil in the country, the crucial green light from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) could come at a heavy cost.\n\nMele Kyari, the group managing director of NNPC, has said International Oil Companies (IOCs) divesting from Nigeria\u2019s upstream sector must address issues of abandonment and decommissioning of oil assets.\n\nDecommissioning, which is the general term for returning an oil production site to its pre-lease condition at the end of the useful life of the oil asset, can be a costly exercise for the companies involved. Many fields abandoned in Nigeria are not decommissioned largely because the local companies who acquire them don\u2019t have the required funds to do so.\n\n\u201cWe will not end the 2012 situation in Nigeria; it will be done in a manner that brings value to Nigeria,\u201d said Kyari at a panel session during the Nigerian International Energy Summit in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nHe had said on Monday that to sustain a prosperous business environment for Nigeria, the national oil company would pay particular attention to abandonment and relinquishment costs, severance of operator staff, third-party contract liabilities, and competency of the buyer of any divested asset.\n\nThe completion of the Seplat/ExxonMobil deal is subject to ministerial consent and other required regulatory approvals. It is usually at this stage that such deals emerge whole or come out bleeding in every opening.\n\nWhile the NNPC has not hidden its intention to snap up the assets, it has struggled to raise financing. Only last month, the NNPC and the African Export-Import Bank agreed to raise $5 billion as corporate finance to fund major investments in Nigeria\u2019s upstream sector.\n\nIt is not clear if the NNPC has obtained this financing but there are fears its cooperation would be harder to secure.\n\nSome analysts say that for the deal to get to this stage, NNPC may have already provided some support or laid conditions that must be met.\n\nAyodele Oni, energy lawyer and partner at Bloomfield Law Practice, said there are pre-emption rights for NNPC\u2019s joint operating agreements.\n\nThese pre-emption rights usually give the NNPC the right to match the best (financial) terms for any such acquisition and acquire the said asset, according to him.\n\n\u201cUsually, one condition to closing such deals is a document evincing the waiver of pre-emption rights by the NNPC and other joint venture partners, if any. Thus, generally speaking, and depending on the stage they are at and whether a waiver has even been obtained from NNPC, it may be able to scuttle same,\u201d Oni said.\n\nAccording to the terms of the Joint Venture (JV) contract, the NNPC, which holds a 60 percent share in the Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU) JV, has the right of first refusal in any asset sale agreement.\n\nSome analysts have said that NNPC could throw a monkey wrench into the deal because its views would be taken seriously before the deal secures ministerial blessing.\n\nRead also: Seplat Energy grows full-year pre-tax profit by 321.1% to N71bn\n\nA source close to the government said it might be hard to get this blessing on account of \u201cthe issues NNPC is throwing up.\u201d\n\nThe costs involved in decommissioning assets and volatile oil prices are major concerns. Oil prices have risen to over $100, and there is no telling if it would sell for half this price when the assets are due for decommissioning.\n\n\u201cThis is further complicated by the reality that the full extent of the decommissioning work to be done may not have been fully known at the time of the asset transfer, and the accurate decommissioning costs may not have been factored into the negotiations,\u201d Adebowale Adeniyi, a senior manager at Andersen Tax LP, said in a note.\n\nThe Nigerian tax laws do not allow the tax deductibility of any provision/estimate for decommissioning or cost of abandonment, except when incurred or when such an expense is set aside in a funded sinking fund.\n\nAccording to Adeniyi, given the capital-intensive nature of oil and gas operations and the consequent requirement of funds to finance other investments, it becomes a business challenge for an oil company to leave idle its cash in a sinking fund, to support a decommissioning exercise that may be years away.\n\nOnshore and shallow waters assets in the country are bedevilled with challenges such as agitations from host communities and sabotage, forcing the IOCs to move offshore.\n\nThe Petroleum Industry Act provides attractive options to develop deepwater assets, removing the 85 percent tax but now requiring that companies only pay their company income taxes and royalty.\n\nAccording to the transaction document seen by BusinessDay, Seplat Energy has agreed to buy the entire shallow-water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria for $1.2 billion.\n\nThe company said it had entered into an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU from ExxonMobil Corporation.\n\nThe transaction agreement also includes potential additional contingent consideration of up to $300 million in total, payable over the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2026, and contingent upon average Brent crude oil prices exceeding $70 per barrel and subject to MPNU\u2019s average working interest production exceeding 60,000 barrels per day (boepd) (joint venture -150,000 boepd) in such calendar year.\n\nRoger Brown, CEO of Seplat Energy, said, \u201cThis transaction underpins Seplat Energy\u2019s drive to be a leader in the growth of the indigenous independent energy sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition is a perfect fit with our strategy to build a sustainable business and deliver energy transition in Nigeria. Our financial strength has enabled us to attract high quality local and international capital providers to fund this transaction without diluting our existing shareholders and reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will create one of the largest independent energy companies on both the Nigerian and London Stock Exchanges, and bolster Seplat Energy\u2019s ability to drive increased growth, profitability, and overall stakeholder prosperity\n\nBased on 2020 working interest volumes for Seplat Energy and MPNU, the transaction delivers 186 percent increase in production from 51,000boepd to 146,000boepd, 170 percent increase in 2P liquids reserves, from 241 MMbbl to 650 MMbbl, 14 percent increase in 2P gas reserves from 1,501 Bscf to 1,712 Bscf, including the significant undeveloped gas potential of 2,910 Bscf (JV: 7,275 Bscf).\n\nIt will also add an 89 percent increase in total 2P reserves from 499 MMboe to 945 MMboe1 and Includes offshore fields with dedicated, MPNU-operated export routes offering enhanced security and reliability.\n\nThe MPNU asset portfolio in Nigeria primarily consists of 40 percent operating ownership of four Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 67, 68, 70 and 104 as well as the associated infrastructure (NNPC is the 60 percent partner); the Qua Iboe Terminal, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest export facilities; 51 percent interest in Bonny River Terminal and Natural Gas Liquids Recovery Plants at EAP and Oso.\n\nIt does not include ExxonMobil\u2019s deepwater assets in Nigeria.\n\nMPNU will operate as a standalone subsidiary of Seplat Energy and upon closing and following receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, Seplat Energy will align MPNU with its overall strategic goals and ESG objectives, the company said.",

          "text": "Ibe Kachikwu, a former minister of state for petroleum resources, has said the flurry of divestments by International Oil Companies from onshore and shallow waters does not bode well for Nigeria and the government needs to have an honest conversation on how to deal with the issues.\n\nIn remarks at the fifth edition of the Nigerian International Energy Summit in Abuja on Tuesday, Kachikwu said the divestments happening at the same time \u201cmeans something is wrong,\u201d adding that the country needed IOCs\u2019 funding capacity to develop the assets.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a relationship discussion with the IOCs; if they are not doing crude, they can do gas,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, ExxonMobil announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its equity interest in Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited to Seplat Energy, a Nigerian independent oil and gas company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Seplat Energy Offshore Limited.\n\nWhen finalised, the sale will include the Mobil Development Nigeria and Mobil Exploration Nigeria equity ownership of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, which holds a 40 per cent stake in four oil mining licenses, including more than 90 shallow-water and onshore platforms and 300 producing wells.\n\n\u201cThis sale will allow us to prioritise competitively advantaged investments in our strategic assets, and it supports the Nigerian government\u2019s efforts to grow its oil and gas operations,\u201d said Liam Mallon, president of ExxonMobil Upstream Oil, and Gas.\n\nThe transaction, valued at over $1.2 billion, is just one of the divestments planned by oil majors operating in the country. Shell and Chevron have their divestment programme in the works.\n\nShell has progressed discussion with local companies bidding for its assets.\n\nThe IOCs are looking to increase their footprint in the deep offshore space, which is less prone to the communal issues and sabotage commonly experienced with onshore and shallow-water assets.\n\nRead also: Oil theft, pipeline vandalism fuelling IOCs divestment in Nigeria downstream sector \u2014 NEITI\n\nKachikwu argued that since Nigeria had declared its \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019, it could make a case for the oil majors to use their financial clout to develop gas, which is seen as a transition fuel.\n\nThe former minister urged the Nigerian government to speed up oil production to harness value from rising prices, seek new financing models, and leverage energy sources such as wind and sun available in the country in response to the energy transition.\n\n\u201cWe have tended to export crude oil in perpetuity; we should now be adding value,\u201d said Kachikwu, praising the Dangote Refinery billed to come on stream at the third quarter of the year and modular refineries.\n\nHe urged the government to reallocate unused oil blocks rather than having fields lying fallow.\n\n\u201cWe have to distribute acreages and resource allocation to ensure equitable distribution, otherwise, the same problems we have seen with oil, you will get with gas,\u201d he said.",

It should focus on that area. You are focusing on these social services and amenities at a time when the economy of the nation is depressed and not growing at all.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cSome of the things that happened in the recent past can\u2019t be spoken about publicly. I urge the commission never to allow what happened during the sharing of conditional cash transfer from the Federal Government to happen again.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not happy and are angry with the way the conditional cash transfer and sharing of social and economic amenities were handled. The commission needs to look at that and never allow it to happen again.\u201d\n\nNoting that the visit came at the right time as it was necessary to address the lingering issues troubling Nigerians, Obaseki said: \u201cOur founding fathers thought it wise that, in order to preserve the unity of this country, they needed to create a commission that would complement the policy which ensured that every Nigerian will feel that they are part of the country. This was done so that whatever belongs to the country would be equitably and fairly distributed to all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThank you for keeping the spirit of the constitution alive and trying to enforce the constitution as many people feel marginalised in spite of the effort of the commission. Nigerians feel they are not getting what is due them.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe cake we are trying to share in this country is becoming too small as our focus is to build a bigger cake that will be equitably shared. Everybody should be made to contribute something to the national cake for it to be enough for us to share.\n\n\u201cYou have done well as you go about to implement the first task of your mandate, which is ensuring equitable distribution of positions. In fairness, you have done well in that regard.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Executive Chairman, Federal Character Commission, Dr. Muheeba Dankaka, said the visit is in continuation of her engagements with critical stakeholders in the country, adding: \u201cUpon assumption of office, I made it a matter of policy to consult widely and drink from the wealth of experiences of our leaders of thought like you to guide my actions in the course of my assignment.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Character Commission was established with a primary focus of ensuring a strong, virile and indivisible nation, based on fairness, equity and justice, to promote national unity, foster national loyalty and give every citizen of Nigeria a sense of belonging to the nation, notwithstanding the diversities of ethnic origin, culture, language or religion, which may exist.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I obeyed my mother when the pressure became unbearable. I left my three-month-old son behind. He should be six-year-old now,\u201d she narrated.\n\n\u201cI had to obey my mother and embark on the journey, when the pressure became unbearable.\n\n\u201cI left my three months old son behind in my mum\u2019s care and have not seen him since. He should be six years old now. My trafficker paid for the journey from Nigeria to Libya, which started on February 26, 2016.\n\n\u201cBefore leaving Nigeria, my trafficker had informed me that I would refund the money spent on me for the journey, although she did not tell me the actual amount.\n\n\u201cI ended up paying her N2.2 million equivalent by engaging in \u2018aristo\u2019 (prostitution) throughout my six years sojourn,\u201d said the returnee.\n\nWhen she completed the payment, Tosin\u2019s trafficker transferred her to another trafficker for another round of the prostitution business, \u201cwho I paid N1 million, being new proceeds from prostitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cComing to Nigeria now with only N200,000 that I hid, I don\u2019t want to see my mother and son till I have enough money on me,\u201d and started crying.\n\nIn her own account, Blessing, a hairdresser, said \u201ca big sister\u201d from her hometown in Ondo State, promised to take her to Europe on the pretence that she would continue her vocation there.\n\nShe said, \u201cI left Nigeria on January 3, 2016 and the cold was at its peak at the time. My journey through the desert was horrific but what I experienced in the desert was a child\u2019s play compared with the inhuman treatment meted out to me by my burger (trafficker) who is from my town and street.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that I was ill as a result of the harsh weather in the desert, my trafficker forced me to have sex on the day I entered Libya by fixing me up with a client. That was the day I was deflowered. I used by body to pay my trafficker a total sum of N4.5m. The trafficker took nine of us out of Ondo State.\u201d\n\nFarinloye said the returnees, comprising 80 adult males, eight male children, two male infants, 30 adult females, four female children and four female infants, were brought back to Nigeria by the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nOther agencies at the reception are the Nigerian Immigration Service, Federal Ministry of Health, the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and the Nigeria Police Force",

Now, the time has come. We have to start to empower our people. The empowerment is for those who have been patient.\n\n\u201cAs a government, when there is unemployment, some people bring out what they called welfare scheme to be able to cushion the level of poverty in the society. That is what we are going to apply here.\u201d\n\nPerforming the inauguration of the Oro-Abali Flyover project, Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, said he was elated to commission yet another beautiful project of Governor Wike, delivered to address critical transportation problem in the area.\n\n\u201cWhat he is doing in terms of urban renewal is something I can say is only comparable to what is in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that this is being planned in a manner that is really judiciously using Rivers money without any burden of loan.\u201d\n\nRivers State Commissioner of Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi, explained that Oro-Abali Flyover was undertaken by Wike\u2019s administration to solve vehicular traffic situation in Port Harcourt and its environs.\n\nHe said the dualised flyover would make commuting easier, support and promote commerce as well as serve as foundation for opportunities that would engender wealth creation.\n\nThe Managing Director of Julius Berger, Lars Richter, commended the Rivers State government for giving the company the opportunity to be part of the ongoing infrastructural transformation of the state.",

You know the contribution of SMEs to the GDP and to the employment of youth generally in the country is high. So, across the country, we had to undertake what we called a survey on Nigeria cuisines.\n\n\u201cThese are foods that are all over the country and we have standardized them and we have identified those ones that we feel that we can transform into franchises.

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate Tuesday passed for third reading 47 out of the 68 bills its Ad- hoc committee on Constitution Review presented to it for voting.\n\nThe remaining 21 bills, four of which were women-related and bordering on Affirmative Action in political appointments and special legislative seats, didn\u2019t sail through.\n\nLeading the pack of passed bills was item 58 which deals with independent candidacy with 89 senators voting in its favour while 5 voted against it.\n\nThe Bill reads: \u201cThe bill seeks to alter the Constitution to allow an Independent candidate contest for an elective position.\n\n\u201cThis is aimed at expanding the space for Democratic participation by providing a platform outside political parties, for persons to participate and contest elections.\u201d\n\nMany of the power devolution-related bills like financial autonomy for local government, administrative autonomy for local government, moving of management and regulations of airports and railway and others from legislative list to concurrent list also sailed through.\n\nOthers are item 31 which deals with establishment and maintenance of correctional centres moved from the Exclusive List to Concurrent list.\n\nThe bill reads: \u201cThis bill seeks to delete the item \u201cPrisons\u201d from the exclusive legislative list and redesignate it as Correctional Services in the Concurrent Legislative List.\n\n\u201cThe Establishment and maintenance of Correctional Services should not be a matter within the exclusive preserve of the Federal Government as most of the correctional services should not be a matter within the exclusive preserve of the Federal Government as most of the correctional centres are populated by offenders against State Laws like Armed Robbery, Murder, Kidnapping etc.\u201d\n\nRailway, listed as item 32 in the bill, was moved from Exclusive List to Concurrent List to enable states establish and maintain railways with their states as matters pertaining to mass transit needed not be within the exclusive preserve of the federal government.\n\nThe Senate, also within the prism of devolution of powers, passed item 9 of the bill which deals with financial autonomy of state legislatures and state judiciary.\n\nIt also, as stated in item 53, dealing with separation of office of Attorney General of the Federation from that of the Minister of Justice, passed it with 86 out of 92 senators who participated in the voting.\n\nHowever, efforts made by the presiding officers of the National Assembly to confer power of immunity on themselves and be entitled to pension collections after leaving offices failed.\n\nThe two provisions were overwhelmingly voted against by lawmakers at both Chambers.\n\nTwo different provisions seeking for mayoral status for FCT and possible appointment of anybody from FCT as minister also failed.\n\nAlso knocked off in the Senate during the voting, was item 34 which seeks inclusion of Value Added Tax on the Exclusive List as only 41 senators voted for it out of the required 73.\n\nThe margin of votes got widened during voting on all the women-related bills.\n\nAffirmative Action\n\nFirst to be thrown out was item 35 which dwells on Special Seats for Women in Parliament as advocated last week by the First Lady, Aisha Buhari.\n\nRejecting the proposal, 58 senators voted against it while 30 voted in its favour.\n\nItem 37 which seeks affirmative action for women in political party administration was also kicked out with 53 senators rejecting the proposal and just 30 voting in favour.\n\nSimilar fate befell item 68 of the bill which seeks affirmative action for women in terms of ministerial appointments and commissioners at the state level.\n\nThe provision seeks appointment of minimum of 10 female ministers at the federal level and likewise at the state level, but got thrown out with only 44 senators voting for it out of the required 73.\n\nMove to give the traditional rulers constitutional role also failed as item 67 seeking the establishment of National and State Councils of Traditional Rulers respectively, for the purposes of advising the President and Governors on matters relating to customary laws, security and public order, also suffered setback.\n\nSenate president remarks\n\nIn his remarks after the voting which lasted about five hours, Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said all the items passed in both the Senate and the House of Representatives would be sent to the States Houses of Assembly this month for required 2/3 concurrence.\n\nReps on overriding veto\n\nIn a related development, the House of Representatives voted out a Bill seeking a special procedure for the National Assembly to override the veto of a sitting president on transmitted proposed legislations.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the ongoing voting on the 68 recommended Bills by the Deputy Speaker Idris Wase-led Special Committee for the review of the 1999 Constitution, Tuesday, 284 members voted \u201cYes\u201d, 10 voted \u201cNo\u201d, while there was no record of abstinence.\n\nThe Bill failed at that level as it could not secure the required 4/5 (288) yes votes to scale through.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the presence of Dolapo, wife of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, in company with Minister of Women Affairs Dame Pauline Tallen, all in solidarity for affirmative action, members voted in rejection of a Bill calling for special seats for women at the National Assembly, and State Houses of Assembly.\n\nWife of the President, Aisha Buhari was also in the chamber last week, when report on the proposed amendments was laid.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the House rejected proposals for Diaspora voting, life pension for presiding officers of the national and state assemblies, as well as extension of immunity to judicial officers and legislative houses.\n\n\n\nHowever, the House voted in support of the proposal for an elected mayor for the Federal Capital Territory, and for the minister of the FCT to be appointed from among indigenes of the city, as it further approved free and compulsory basic education as a human right.\n\n\n\nAlso, the proposal to abrogate the controversial state and local government joint account and to establish the local government as independent and democratically levied councils was approved through majority votes of members.\n\nThe proposal that VAT be moved to the Exclusive Legislative List in the Constitution was rejected as 209 members voted against, with only 91 in support while six members abstained.\n\nGbajabiamila\n\nPrior to commencement of the voting, which was done electronically, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila advised his colleagues to take the exercise serious, stressing that \u201cwhatever amendment you vote for, it will be recorded against you. That\u2019s how parliament works.\u201d",

According to him, the National Assembly should rather be more interested in the restructuring of the country.\n\n\u201cI have gone through most of the items which the National Assembly has taken up and unfortunately, it has conformed with what I have felt about their modifications of the constitution,\u201d he said during the show on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThey are totally irrelevant to our needs at the moment.

They have not touched that at all.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Writes Senate, Seeks Amendment Of Section 84 (12) In Electoral Act\n\nHe explained that the country should be interested in talking of a funding formula for the federation.\n\n\u201cWe should retain the provisions of the 1963 constitution under which regions, now states, retained 50 percent of its resources, sent 20 percent to the Federal Government, and sent 30 percent to a distributable pool \u2014 to be distributed among the states of the federation in accordance with your level of sufficiency in terms of provisions,\u201d the legal personnel noted.\n\n\u201cUnder the distributable pool, the least able state \u2014 the poorest state \u2014 gets more from that pool. Every state, even the rich ones, also get some. Under that formula, 50 for the state, 20 for the Federal Government, 30 to the distributable pool.\u201d\n\nSagay also said most of the debates around the local government in the constitutional amendment are irrelevant.\n\n\u201cWhat they should discuss is total removal of the provisions of the local government from the constitution. The constitution shouldn\u2019t tell us what we should do about our local governments. It should not contain a list of our local governments,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cLocal government is a state matter. 100 percent, it is a state matter. It has nothing to do with the Federal Government. When you talk about the funding of local governments \u2014 how to create a special account for LG separate from the state governments \u2014 they are irrelevant; it shouldn\u2019t be in the constitution at all.\u201d",

          "text": "The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has received another batch of 128 stranded Nigerian returnees from Libya.\n\nThe Director-General of NEMA, Mustapha Ahmed, who was represented by the NEMA Lagos Territorial Office Coordinator, Ibrahim Farinloye, received the Voluntary Assisted Returnees at the Cargo Wing of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Ikeja on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe IOM-assisted returnees arrived aboard Al Buraq Air Boeing 100 \u2013 800 with registration number 5A-DMG.\n\nProfiles of the returnees indicated that 80 adult males, 8 male children, and 2 male infants along with 30 adult females, 4 female children, and 4 female infants, were voluntarily assisted back to the country by the IOM.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Mistreatment Claims] Nigeria, Other African Nations Scramble To Evacuate Citizens From Ukraine\n\nA 29 years old distressed young woman, while narrating her ordeals, regretted how she had been misled by her mother to embark on a fruitless journey.\n\nMiss Tosin Omole alleged that her mother was approached by a street sister who sweet-talked her into convincing her daughter to embark on the journey to Europe, but the final destination changed.\n\nThe unsuspecting victim obeyed her mother by embarking on the journey after pressures became unbearable; she left her three-month-old son behind in the care of her mum.\n\nAccording to her, the child is bout 6 years old now.\n\nMs Omole narrated how the proposed journey to Europe became a hellish life of prostitution in Libya.\n\n\u201cMy trafficker paid for the journey from Nigeria to Libya which started on 26th February 2016.\n\n\u201cBefore leaving Nigeria, my trafficker had informed me that I will refund the money spent on me for the journey though she did not tell me the amount.\n\n\u201cI ended up paying her 2.2 million naira equivalent by engaging in aristo (prostitution) throughout my 6 years\u2019 sojourn.\n\n\u201cAfter this, my initial trafficker sold me to another burga (trafficker), I paid 1 million to the new man, all the payment is through prostitution.\n\n\u201cComing to Nigeria now with only 200,000 naira that I squeezed to save, I don\u2019t want to see my mother till I have enough,\u201d Ms Omole narrated.\n\nWhen asked why would she be angry to the extent of avoiding meeting her son upon her return to Nigeria, she burst into tears, weeping bitterly.\n\n\u2018My Experience Was Horrific\u2019\n\nIn another case, Ms Blessing Muhammad, who believed that her mother did her a great favour for spurring her to embark on the journey to Europe, said every mother will be happy when her child is about to travel to greener pastures.\n\n\u201cMy mum bought clothes and make-over stuff for me when I was travelling,\u201d she narrated.\n\n\u201cA popular big sister at Akungba approached my mother and convinced that she would help me travel to Europe with the promise that I will be doing my hairdressing work or I can be doing housemaid to be able to raise money and support my mother and siblings.\n\n\u201cMy mother has not been feeling well and she needs support; I was second to the last born in the family. My elder siblings cannot be supportive because of their economic status.\n\n\u201cMy journey through the desert was horrific; I was to be buried, the grave had been dug and just as I was about to be thrown into the grave, I miraculously showed signs of life as I was told, I came back to life. I left Nigeria on the 3rd of January, 2016 and the cold was at its peak at the time; I died and resurrected; that was what I can say\n\n\u201cWhat I experienced in the desert was a child\u2019s play compared to the inhuman treatment meted out to me by my burga (trafficker) who happens to be from my town and same street.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that I fell ill as a result of the harsh weather in the desert, my trafficker forced me to be \u2018dis-virgined\u2019 on the day I entered Libya by fixing me up with a client.\n\n\u201cTo God, I used my body (prostitution) to pay my trafficker a total sum of 4.5 million naira.\n\n\u201cThe worst part of my experience was the mental instability I found myself in; this was due to various trauma I passed through in the hands of my trafficker.\n\n\u201cMy trafficker took nine of us out of Akungba; presently I am the only one returning due to my health. Though I thank God that I am recuperating fast but I have to return to Nigeria in order not to relapse.\n\n\u201cAny time I shout out of anxiety or anger, the mental illness will resurface.\n\n\u201cI cannot ask my enemies to embark on any journey out Nigeria to seek for any non-existing job at all.\n\n\u201cOur people are our enemies; they deceive us to leave Nigeria,\u201d Ms Blessing Muhammed bitterly recounted.\n\nOther agencies at the reception of the returnees included the Nigerian Immigration Service, Federal Ministry of Health, NAPTIP, FAAN, and the Nigeria Police Force.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has disclosed that about 70 per cent of officers of the Nigerian Armed forces are currently engaged in domestic policing operations in the country.\n\nThis was revealed on Tuesday in Lagos, by Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, when he presented the keynote speech during the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) 2022 Security Meet Business Dialogue Series.\n\nMustapha, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary for Political Economic Affairs, Office of the SGF, Mr. Andrew Adejoh, also stated that the federal government\u2019s 2022 budget for all the security agencies, excluding its statutory contribution to the Police Trust Fund, was N2.41 trillion.\n\nHe said: \u201cClose to 70 per cent of Nigerian armed forces personnel are engaged in policing duties across the 36 states of the federation. That is not what the army is supposed to do. But we have to do that to solve our security problems.\n\n\u201cThe security vote for this year is actually N2.41 trillion. This does not include the statutory allocation to the Police Trust Fund.\n\n\u201cBut money alone will not solve the problem. We need to look at the process and procedures to make sure that the money is put to useful purposes.\u201d\n\nHe also said the federal government was highly disturbed by the escalating security challenges in the country, adding that, \u201cit seemed a number of Nigerians have turned these security challenges into business. But the government is trying as much as it could not to let them have a breathing space.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, who was represented by Major General Adeyemi Yekini, said over 23,000 repentant Boko Haram combatants have so far surrendered their arms to the Nigerian military along with their families, and are now undergoing programme meant to reintegrate them to the society under the government\u2019s Operation Safe Corridor.\n\nIrabor said: \u201cThe popular one, which people do not want to hear about, is the rehabilitation of repentant Boko Haram that have surrendered their weapons. And over 23,000 of them have surrendered to the Nigerian armed forces, thereby helping to mop up small arms in circulation.\n\n\u201cOperation Safe Corridor is about disarmament and reintegration. The aim is to give them (repentant Boko Haram members) skills so that they can go back to their local communities and engage themselves in useful purposes.\u201d\n\nHe added that the military believed that some of the Boko Haram fighters were attracted to terrorism out of frustration caused by economic hardship.\n\nHe also maintained that the military was not interested in politics. \u201cLet me tell you point blank: the military is not interested in politics. We are out to do our job as professional soldiers that defend the territorial integrity of Nigeria and while remaining obedient to civil authorities.\u201d\n\nThe President of the LCCI, Dr. Michael Olawale-Cole, said in his opening remarks that Nigeria was ranked 146 among 163 countries in the 2021 Global Peace Index (GPI) of the Institute of Economics and Peace, which stated that improvements in peace could lead to considerable economic improvement in GDP growth, inflation, and employment.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor the government to achieve better results in confronting insecurity, a key factor is to tackle the root causes and stem degeneration into social disorder and instability. The high level of unemployment and poverty among Nigerians, especially the youths, has consistently attracted them to crimes. Failure to address challenges of poverty, unemployment, and business failures is one of the major factors fueling insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cAs we approach an election year, we recommend that the government separate politics from security and that the security agencies stay off politics. And there is a need to step up enlightenment campaigns against political violence as this could lay an extra burden on our security agencies as they contend with bandits, terrorists, and kidnappers across the country.\n\n\u201cThere have been calls for open and frank dialogue as a critical factor in addressing the security challenges of the nation, using the media and stakeholders\u2019 forums as a catalyst for cooperation among citizens to end the crises.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea on Tuesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to supply gas from Nigeria\u2019s offshore fields to the neighbouring country\u2019s gas processing facility in Punta Europa.\n\nA statement by the Senior Special Adviser, Media, to the Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mr. Horatius Egua, stressed that the MoU kicked off a strategic economic collaboration across the Gulf of Guinea where Nigeria\u2019s abundant natural gas reserves compliment the country\u2019s gas liquefaction infrastructure.\n\nThe Nigerian government stated that the recent passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) coupled with, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Decade of Gas\u201d initiative was creating an enabling environment which triggered the conception of the project.\n\nAccording to the government, this has facilitated major investment inflow from Equatorial Guinea into Nigeria even as the project signals the joint effort of the two countries in working towards a greener energy environment.\n\n\u201cThe execution of this MoU meets one of the imperatives of the decade of gas in Nigeria. Whilst we are focused on the domestic gas agenda, we are keeping an eye on the global gas market as well.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge gas resources, a significant amount of which is offshore and will require unprecedented investment in infrastructure to bring them to market.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration allows much of that stranded gas to access the global gas market within 18 to 24 months in what will be the fastest timeline to market for a Nigerian offshore gas asset.\n\n\u201cThis is possible because Equatorial Guinea brings to the table a major portfolio of world class gas processing and liquefaction infrastructure already in place in Punta Europa, coupled with investment funds for development,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nAdditionally, the government noted that the project which envisions an offshore gas pipeline development would create huge in-country local content opportunities for pipeline and other infrastructure service providers.\n\nThis, it stated was in addition to accelerated royalty revenues that come from producing many gas fields that would have otherwise remained stranded.\n\nMinister of Mines and Hydrocarbons, Equatorial Guinea, Gabriel Nguema Obiang Lima, in his remarks, stated that the execution of this MoU was a great example of the South-south cooperation between neighbouring Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\u201cAs the global geopolitics of natural gas evolves and within the context of the world transitioning to a lower carbon footprint, it is imperative that we think differently on how to remain an important player in energy markets.\n\n\u201cNew, fast, and competitive sources will be a major determinant of success. This strategic collaboration breaks down geographical boundaries and allows delivery of gas from Nigeria to Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Punta Europa facilities, extending their life and providing access to the regional and global energy markets.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC and its JV partners get a unique opportunity to monetise gas that would have otherwise been stranded offshore due to absence of infrastructure,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to the statement, as the world energy dynamics change, Nigeria aims to adapt rapidly to ensure that it remains at the forefront of world gas exporters.",

          "title": "Despite Conversations Around Energy Transition, Oil Will Still Be Relevant, Nigeria Government Insists",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Tuesday stated that despite globaal push for the stoppage of the exploration of fossil fuels, crude oil would continue to be relevant in the coming years.\n\nSpeaking on the third day of the Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES) tagged: \u201cRevitalising the Industry: Future Fuels and Energy Transition,\u201d the Minister of State, Petroleum said industry stakeholders must begin to drive a new narrative, using gas as a transition fuel.\n\nStating that the oil and gas industry would face more scrutiny in their operations and business models in the coming days, Sylva noted that operators would have to explain more often the impact of their activities on the environment.\n\nIn addition, he stated that their contributions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and their efforts towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions, would be questioned more often.\n\n\u201cWhile we pursue the country\u2019s energy transition agenda, let us also recognise that fossil fuels will continue to play a critical role in our energy and economic systems.\n\n\u201cWhile the role may appear to be in contradiction with the energy transition agenda, fossil fuels will still remain important and will remain integral part of the vision in our energy transition journey,\u201d he explained.\n\nSylva stated that the federal ministry of petroleum resources, in discharge of its mandate, would continue to be an enabler to make a seamless energy transition in Nigeria happen.\n\nHe added that the federal government would continue to provide an enabling environment to improve the oil and gas value chain, driven by modern technology, industry, best practices, stakeholders\u2019 engagement and innovations in alternative energy.\n\nHe urged stakeholders to come up with an accelerated energy transition strategy for the country, look at the critical factors that could make them happen and whether the factors relate to the government, society, policy makers, technology, investors or the industry itself.\n\nQuoting Dr. Fatih Birol, who is the Executive Director of International Energy Agency, (IEA) Sylva noted that, \u201cNo energy company will be unaffected by this energy transition,\u201d adding that \u201cEvery part of the industry needs to consider how to respond since doing nothing is simply not an option.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari, while speaking, stated that Nigeria must take advantage of today\u2019s resources and then work towards the energy transition target of 2060.\n\nStressing that the NNPC and partners were working to increase domestic crude oil production, he added that in conjunction with the country\u2019s security agencies, the unfavourable security situation was being sorted out.\n\nHe maintained that while energy transition remained real, the company was looking at how it can increase the resources of today by getting more investment and promote gas development.\n\nKyari maintained that the NNPC has a programme to take out the current flare levels, noting that flaring of gas was going on in very many locations that they shouldn\u2019t, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, we are pulling resources together to take out these flares. At the second level, any company which pegs flaring as part of its development plan, will be disallowed. This is very practical,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to the GMD, with the AKK project, the NNPC would deliver gas throughout the nation of about eight to 10 billion scf, admitting however that there were still pricing issues, which would be taken care by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nIn his comments, a former Minister of Petroleum Resources and ExxonMobil Executive, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, stated that Nigeria must take full advantage of its fossil fuel resources while they last.\n\nWhile stating that the country does not have up to 30 to 40 years to do that, he explained that Nigeria has a limited time to take advantage of its resources.\n\nHe further said it was important to fast-track oil production and value addition.\n\nHe pointed out that Nigeria needed to work very fast to rehabilitate the refineries and then take the issue of gas production seriously, but mentioned that the issues of funding, tax regime, among others, have to be sorted out.\n\nAccording to him, since developing gas has become more important than developing crude, Nigeria needs to pay attention to the transition product, gas, adding that in 10 to 15 years, the developed world will move away from gas. According to him, while sale of assets is a fantastic opportunity, Nigeria still needed the funding for major projects, adding however that the country must not forget to celebrate the milestones it had made in the last couple of years.\n\nHe noted that while opening up the oil sector was important, a situation where one person has 10 to 15 blocks and refuse to develop them, while holding just a certificate of occupancy, must be reviewed.\n\nManaging Director of Chevron, Nigeria, Rick Kennedy, in his intervention, stated that the country is endowed with everything to succeed in the energy industry, including a young population of talented people.\n\nAlso, Managing Director, Nigeria NLNG, Philip Mshelbila, in his remarks, explained that the company has reduced gas flaring from more than 65 per cent to currently less than 20 per cent due to its de-carbonisation programme.",
