          "title": "Close network deficit in rural areas, CITAD urges FG",
          "text": "The Centre for Information Technology and Development has called on the Federal Government to create a national policy for community networks in Nigeria that will bridge communication network deficits in rural areas.\n\nThe Executive Director, CITAD, Yinusa Yau, made the call during a press conference on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nHe stressed the need to unleash the potential of community networks to address connective gaps.\n\nHe said CITAD acknowledged the various efforts that the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy had made towards repositioning the country for a digital transformation.\n\nHowever, he said that due to the digital deficit in the country, the good objectives of these policies and programmes would be difficult to achieve.\n\nYau said, \u201cThe initiatives have not, in a fundamental way, addressed the issues of bridging the connectivity gaps in the over 114 underserved and unserved communities in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive that the number of unserved and underserved communities is the result of the painstaking work of another government agency, the Universal Service Provision Fund.\n\n\u201cCommunity networks remain the tool to unleashing the creativity of citizens, mobilising their resources, skills and other endowments to meet their collective digital communication challenge by themselves without asking for government to fund such bridging efforts or waiting for MNOs who are reluctant to do so because what is left are the unprofitable leftovers.\n\n\u201cIt is in this connection and in furtherance of the voice of the stakeholders meeting, we would like to renew our call on the government to as a matter of urgency provide the country with a national policy on community networks.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, a large number of people in rural areas will be left behind in the Federal Government\u2019s drive for a digital economy and broadband penetration if a national policy for community networks is not created.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the ministry and agencies under it to create a national policy that would be beneficial to those in the rural areas.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we would like to call on the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy to set up a mechanism for the development of a National Policy for Community Networks,\u201d Yau said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Federal Government paid interest of N2.03tn from January 2020 to November 2021 on the loans it got from the Central Bank of Nigeria through the Ways and Means Advances, according to official data.\n\nWays and Means Advances is a loan facility used by the central bank to finance the government in periods of temporary budget shortfalls subject to limits imposed by law.\n\nData obtained from the government\u2019s Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper 2022-2024 show N912.57bn was spent on the payments of interest on Ways and Means Advances in 2020, although there was no budgetary allocation for it in the 2020 budget.\n\nThe Federal Government spent N1.12tn on interest on Ways and Means Advances from January to November last year, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said during the public presentation of the approved 2022 budget, although there was no budgetary allocation for it in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe CBN said on its website that the Federal Government\u2019s borrowing from it through the Ways and Means Advances could have adverse effects on the bank\u2019s monetary policy to the detriment of domestic prices and exchange rates.\n\n\u201cThe direct consequence of central banks\u2019 financing of deficits are distortions or surges in monetary base leading to adverse effect on domestic prices and exchange rates i.e macroeconomic instability because of excess liquidity that has been injected into the economy,\u201d it said.\n\nThe World Bank had in November last year warned the Nigeria government against financing deficits by borrowing from the CBN through the Ways and Means Advances, saying this put fiscal pressures on the country\u2019s expenditures.\n\nAccording to the bank, the CBN financing and the fuel subsidy tend to adversely affect investments in human and physical capital.\n\nIt said that the government had always under-budgeted for debt service as the government failed to consider the cost of ways and means financing in its debt service allocation.\n\nA global credit rating agency, Fitch Ratings, had in January 2021 raised concerns over the Federal Government\u2019s repeated recourse to its ways and means facility with the central bank.\n\nThe agency said that the use of central bank financing in Nigeria could raise risks to macro-stability in the context of weak institutional safeguards that preserve the credibility of policymaking and the ability of the central bank to control inflation.\n\nThe PUNCH had exclusively reported on August 18, 2021 that the Federal Government\u2019s total borrowing from the CBN through Ways and Means Advances ballooned to N15.51tn, rising by 2,286 per cent in six years, according to data from the CBN.\n\nThe N15.51tn owed by the Federal Government to the central bank as of June 2021 is not part of the country\u2019s total public debt stock, which stood at N38tn as of September 2021.\n\nHowever, the DMO said recently that it was working out the process of restructuring the overdrafts of the CBN for government financing to a long-tenored debt.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Financial and economic experts have expressed concerns over the International Monetary Fund\u2019s debt service-to-revenue ratio projection for Nigeria.\n\nThe IMF had on Monday predicted that Nigeria\u2019s debt service-to-revenue ratio would jump to 92 per cent in 2022 from 76 per cent in 2021.\n\nThe experts, who spoke to our correspondent in separate interviews, said such a percentage would plunge the country into huge debts, deepen the poverty rate and worsen the infrastructural deficit.\n\nA development economist, Aliyu Ilias, said the refusal of the government to remove petrol subsidy might significantly increase expenditure in the year, forcing the government to resort to borrowing to close its widening fiscal deficit.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe consequence will be a larger infrastructural deficit; it will also deepen poverty, and forex will be a problem because we will have to go cap in hand to borrow again. And when we do that, there will be more problems.\n\n\u201cAlready the government has said that it will borrow about N6tn but now that they have to retain fuel subsidy with a larger cost that wasn\u2019t captured in the budget, that means expenditure will increase and so will our fiscal deficit.\n\n\u201cAlso, capital expenditure will be the worst hit if the government continues the way it is going, which will mean no infrastructure for Nigeria. All the money may be spent on recurrent expenditure, which will erode development.\u201d\n\nIlias advised the government to seek better ways to generate revenue such as widening its tax net and privatising its assets.\n\nAn economist and professor of Economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ogun State, Sheriffdeen Tella, said, \u201cThe impacts will be poor growth and development, because the money that should be spent on capital and development projects will be used for debt servicing.\n\n\u201cAs such it will be unlikely that we will meet our growth expectations.\u201d\n\nHe, however, argued that the government may not have to increase its borrowing if the price of crude oil continues to rise as it is the main source of government revenue.\n\nThe Managing Director, Cowry Asset Management Limited, Johnson Chukwu, said the projection of the IMF was expected as the government spent over 70 per cent of its revenue on debt servicing as of November 2021.\n\nHe said the government could offset the negative consequences associated with its rising debt profile by cutting out unnecessary expenditure from its budget.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Governor Udom Emmanuel by the grace of God has endorsed that I run for the office of governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\n\u201cI am here to tell Akwa Ibom people, members of the NUJ that by the grace of God I understand the policies of government. We will teach our youths how to get involved with international companies, how not to be afraid. We cannot just be players in Akwa Ibom, we can join the league of international players.\n\n\u201cOur youths will not have to be in the Street to beg for money, they can make money for themselves. And the money you work for, you will always manage it well. So there is need to encourage our youths and to show them the way.\n\n\u201d I want to assure our people that if given a chance to be your governor come May 2023, Akwa Ibom State will be connected to all the doors of development that governor Udom Emmanuel has done in the area of tourism, Agriculture, rural development, ICT, etc. These are low-hanging fruits\u201d\n\nThe governorship aspirant assured that he would build on the legacies of the governor stressing, \u201cI am a good student of governor Udom Emmanuel. I know his blue print, and he has done well. The massive roads, the industries, and he has done a lot in education.\n\n\u201cEven his greatest critics know that he has done very well, but there is need for continuity. And I am one person that will build on those legacies, I am one person that can ensure continuity of the industries.

He was aged 79.\n\nFayemi, in a condolence message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, said the late Scholar-Priest was an admirable personality who lived a life of service worthy of emulation.\n\nThe governor said the late Adebiyi\u2019s life was a testimony of a young church organist whom many people never expected could become a great clergyman; describing him as a humble giant through whom God did many wonders.\n\nWhile noting that Adebiyi was a man of integrity and impeccable character, the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) asserted that the late clergyman jealously guarded that which was entrusted to him by God and the church; leading to the growth of the Anglican Diocese of Lagos West which has no fewer than 270 new churches.\n\nGovernor Fayemi stated that the late Bishop Adebiyi simultaneously pursued a career in the ministry as well as a parallel career as an academic and taught at Ondo State University (now Ekiti State University) Ado Ekiti between 1983 and 1987 and later lectured at the Lagos State University, Ojoo.\n\n\u201cThe news of the death of Bishop Peter Adebiyi was shocking and unexpected. He was one of Ekiti\u2019s finest, a worthy Ekiti Ambassador and a man of honour. He was a man of integrity who distinguished himself as a clergyman and an academic. He did not limit himself to the church, he had a second address.\n\n\u201cBishop Adebiyi was an excellent and inspiring Ekiti man who always spoke truth to power. We will sorely miss his wise counsels. May the good Lord grant him eternal rest and give the family the fortitude to bear the loss\u201d, the Governor said.",

Enough is enough since the government is not sincere with the union.\n\n\u201cSince 2009, members of ASUU have remained on the same salary grade level. The agreement is that promotion shall be based on the current exchange rate of the Dollar. You can imagine what we are going through now considering the economic situation,\u201d Inuwa said.\n\nHe added that many of members have not been paid their salaries for as much as 12 months due to the inadequacy of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), submitting that this has brought untold hardship to the lecturers.\n\nThe Federal Government, Inuwa said, had always reneged on the release of earned allowance to universities, a development he said had put lecturers in a more difficult situation as they tried to perform their duties.\n\nThe ASUU branch chairman, informed that the Federal Government was yet to release the N1.5 trillion universities revitalisation funds as agreed.\n\nAccording to him, since the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan released N200billion, the President Buhari-led administration only released paltry sums which had not even gone round the public universities.\n\nHe lamented that despite its inability to fulfil its part of the various MoUs and MoAs signed with the union, the Federal Government has increased charges being paid by students.\n\n\u201cWhile the government is paying lip service and dragging feet on the implementation of the MoUs and MoAs, it went ahead to increase students\u2019 charges claiming that the system will collapse if the charges remained what they were. Who is fooling who?\n\n\u201cIt is wrong for anyone to say that ASUU is insensitive to the problem the strike will have on the academic lives of the students. We too are feeling the pain. The situation is just beyond our control,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then called on the President to be sincere in implementing the various MoUs and MoAs instead of calling on ASUU to rescind its decision of going on another nationwide strike.\n\n\u201cMr President too should be sincere in implementing the various MoUs and MoAs in order to have stability in the tertiary education sector. We are tired of deceit and empty promises,\u201d he declared.",

This is not the way of justice.\n\n\u201cThe scale of justice ought to be balanced in favour of the system and not just Ojerinde.\u201d\n\nICPC counsel, Ebenezer Sogunle, had on Tuesday told the court that Ojerinde\u2019s trial would proceed if the plea bargain failed.",

I contested for the governorship, I won twice. Before that, I was part of the struggle for the return of democracy in Nigeria. We supported several persons for several positions, the Governor, Senate, House of Representatives, House of Assembly, chairmen of councils, councillors and helped people in several political positions in the country.\n\n\u201cThis time, it is the people that asked me to contest for the presidency of Nigeria. When they started, I was not there and they had moved to several places.\n\n\u201cI have told the President, Muhammadu Buhari, that I want to step into his shoes and not his toes. When I told him, he said I should tell the world. That is what I am doing now. I need your prayers for the project.\n\n\u201cI am here to seek the support of Kabiyesi and the people of Egbaland not only to be the candidate of the APC but to win the presidential election and govern the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Ogun State government, Mr Shuaibu Salisu, the Chief of Staff to Governor Dapo Abiodun, said the Alake palace was reputed for producing presidents of the country dating back to the colonial days.\n\nSalisu said the governor would have graced the courtesy call on Alake, but for his travel abroad and had sent a state delegation, including commissioners and party leaders in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis palace is a presidential palace. In the colonial days, a president of Nigeria sat here. In 2011, you were here, in 2015, you were here, in 2015, you were also here and you succeeded.\n\n\u201cEgba Nation, would play her role in Nigeria. This state serves as the Gateway to Nigeria. Nobody can enter Lagos, which is the economic nerve centre of Nigeria without entering Ogun State. This state therefore, is a Gateway to fulfilment of destiny.\u201d\n\nResponding to the request of Tinubu, Oba Gbadebo prayed God to grant his request. The monarch also prayed that it shall be well for Ogun State and Nigeria in general.\n\nTinubu thereafter left Abeokuta for Ilaro to visit the Paramount Ruler of Yewaland and Olu of Ilaro, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle for similar consultation on his ambition.\n\nMeanwhile, Cross River State governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, has stated that Tinubu deserves to contest for the 2023 presidency because he worked and fought hard for the party.\n\nSpeaking with BBC pidgin, monitored by The Nation, Ayade said: \u201cAnybody that has come to contest from the South is in his/her right to do so. More people will still come out.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me about Tinubu, I would say it is correct that he came out, because he fought and worked hard and supported Buhari to put this government that is in place. Such a man will expect that since we are talking about a southern presidency, let him try to contest.\n\n\u201cAnyone that is saying he is not supposed to declare his intention is not doing the right thing. He should try his best. I cannot say it is not good. I can\u2019t say that. I belong to a party, and the party will calculate. If the party says it is Tinubu, I will support him.\n\n\u201cIf the party decides to go with someone else, I will lead the convoy that will go and beg Tinubu about the party\u2019s decision. This is because I know that the man has worked hard for this party, and I have a conscience.\n\n\u201cI am waiting for the party. If the party makes the calculation and says it should not be Tinubu for any reason, everyone deserves respect on their own level. He (Tinubu) deserves special respect. We must go and convince him. He is not a bad person. He is a good person. If he sees that he is given a good reason that convinces him, then we can go ahead. That is my position,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "2023: APC, PDP in zoning dilemma",
          "text": "By Wilfred Eya\n\nThe permutations over which zone should produce the president of Nigeria in 2023 have become a major issue of public discourse. Among various ethnic configurations, political parties and power brokers, zoning is unarguably the central issue as the nation inches toward the next general elections.\n\nWhile the 17 Southern governors have demanded that the region produces the next President, their colleagues from the 19 Northern states have warned that no region can threaten them over the zoning formula.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nAlthough few Northern governors and gladiators have called on political parties to produce a Southerner as President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor, others insist that a Northern candidate should still emerge in 2023. And the ding-dong continues. But unlike the PDP, APC initially hinted at zoning its presidential ticket to the South even though it did not state which part of the geopolitical zone will be favoured to produce the party\u2019s flag-bearer.\n\nAt the moment, certain variables seem to be thawing the earlier position of the APC to go down South. So, in the APC and PDP, there is an impasse over which zone should produce President Buhari\u2019s successor when he leaves office in 2023. Judging by all political calculations, it is difficult to predict the outcome as the two major political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) are currently in a fix over which geo-political zone they should give their presidential ticket in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nBoth parties are battling to wriggle through the zoning conundrum at a minimal cost to their political fortunes in 2023. They are confronted with major but different hurdles though. For the APC, it is being challenged by a moral burden to still retain power in the North after eight years of Buhari\u2019s administration. The President is from North West.\n\nChieftains of the APC pushing for a president from the South insist that the party could not turn around to zone the Presidency to the North after the same region would have ruled the country for eight years in 2023. But again, the headache to the ruling party is that power may slip off its hands if the major opposition party picks its candidate from the North, which is believed to have a more voting population than the South.\n\nFor the PDP, the assumption is that giving its ticket to a Northern candidate seems more attractive as that may be the surest way of recapturing power from the APC if the ruling party zones its presidency Southwards. The PDP also has the moral burden of thinking northwards after President Buhari\u2019s tenure but the counter argument is that the North did not complete its eight years after late Musa Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death.\n\nProponents of this position, especially those from the North, insist it would be unfair for the South to produce the presidential candidate in 2023 given the fact that since 1999, the South was in power for 13 years out of the 16 years that PDP held sway, while the North governed for just three years.\n\nBased on the above calculations, the APC and PDP are treading with caution because where any of the two parties zones its ticket would have a lot of implications on its chances of winning the election. Before the obvious reality confronting the APC, of course the presumption in many quarters was that after President Buhari, power would naturally come down South following the gentleman understanding between gladiators from the North and South of the ruling party. But considering emerging political exigencies, the APC seems to be developing cold feet and being more cautious on zoning the presidency to the South because of the consequences should the PDP decide to pick its candidate from the North.\n\nFollowing that, there are indications that the APC is currently in a dilemma over the zoning of the 2023 presidency. The permutation is that although the party is looking southwards to pick its presidential candidate, there is still the possibility that it could throw the race open for both Northern and Southern aspirants at the end. It is a strategy geared toward ensuring that the party retains the presidency in 2023.\n\nIn the same way, as an opposition party hungry to recapture power, the dominant argument among critical observers is that the best bet for the PDP is to go up North for its presidential candidate in the event that the APC settles for a flag bearer from the South. In a recent poll conducted among PDP members in six states across the geopolitical zones (Kano, Borno, Rivers, Imo, Lagos and Abuja), 70 per cent of those who took part in the survey agreed that the main opposition party should zone its ticket to the North.\n\nIn 1998, the PDP had reached a \u201cgentleman\u2019s\u201d agreement that in the interest of \u201cequity and justice\u201d, the South would have an eight-year stint and this would be returned to the North in 2007.It was on that premise that late Umaru Yar\u2019Adua became the anointed candidate from the North under the banner of the PDP. But in a twist of fate, Yar\u2019Adua died barely three years in office on May 5, 2010. The tragedy placed the party in a quagmire.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIt was in accordance with the constitution but against stiff opposition and massive support that Goodluck Ebele Johnathan became the President of the country, before deciding to run for the same office in 2011. One of the most vocal supporters of the PDP shopping for a candidate of Northern extraction is a chieftain of the party, Chief Raymond Dokpesi. For him, only a Northerner can win the 2023 presidential election for the PDP. He said party members who are canvassing zoning of the ticket to the South are only doing so because they want to copy APC whose members are rooting for conceding the ticket to the South after the completion of President Buhari\u2019s tenure in 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are all Nigerians and there is no need for us to keep deceiving ourselves at this point in time. At the age of 70 and with my experience in organising campaigns in this country, I can tell you that unless there is a candidate from the North, in my own considered opinion, PDP will not stand a chance of winning the election.\n\n\u201cOn the ambition of those from the South who are asking for the presidency to be zoned to the South, I can say that they are only echoing what prevails in APC. In that party, President Muhammadu Buhari has done eight years, so it is imperative on APC to cede the presidency to the South.\u201d But recently, former Aviation Minister and a chieftain of the PDP, Osita Chidoka, said the main opposition party is in a dilemma over the zoning of presidency to any region.\n\nChidoka, who spoke during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, said he would personally want the PDP to field a Southerner from the Eastern part of the country as its candidate. He, however, explained that his party is faced with two tough options \u2013 either to struggle to clinch power or embrace zoning to the detriment of winning the polls.\n\nHe said: \u201cPDP is in a kind of dilemma. Do we struggle to win power first or continue our zoning as we have done or do we continue with the zoning even if that candidate may or may not win the election?\u201d\n\nSo, the calculations on the issue of zoning are similar in terms of the ultimate goal of winning the election but different in the moral burden for fielding candidates from the South.\n\nRealistically, Northern power brokers in APC who are in support of power going down South are more than those in the PDP thinking in the same direction. For instance, among many others, the Katsina State governor, Aminu Masari, has maintained that a Southerner should succeed President Buhari. He had said clearly: \u201cWith regards to zoning, fair is fair. If you ask me, I would, as a person, Aminu, think we should move the presidency to the Southern part of the country,\u201d\n\nA member of the manifesto committee of the defunct merger committee of APC, Chief Osita Okechukwu, went further to say there was a mutual agreement on power shift at the inception of the APC. He said: \u201cThere is a convention. It is a convention. From 1999, the convention of zoning was adopted. It is not written in black and white. It is a convention which provides guidance in liberal democracies. So, nobody can come out and say there was no agreement.\n\n\u201cIn time past, some politicians were persuaded not to run for president for the sake of equity, fairness and justice. So, after President Buhari\u2019s eight years, it should go to the South. The good thing is that there is no part of the country that does not have competent people.\u201d\n\nBut his view is a sharp contrast to the position of ex-Governor Ahmed Sani who expressed doubts about such gentleman\u2019s agreement that power should alternate between the North and the South. His words: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything like agreement. You can ask Mr President, he led the group. Asiwaju (Tinubu) was there. I was part of it. There was no meeting I didn\u2019t attend or any meeting that I attended that there was such agreement. (Such) agreement can\u2019t be verbal; it has to be written. In any case, any agreement that is contrary to laws of this country is not an agreement.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is very clear. We are in a democracy and democracy is governed by processes and procedures and by laws.\u201d\n\nAlready, for both the APC and PDP, there is an array of aspirants from the North and South for the presidential tickets but many are anxious to see whether the concept of zoning would play a major part in who succeeds President Buhari in 2023.",

The Constitution provides a clear delineation of powers between the states and the federal government. The President has overstepped the limit of his constitutional powers by issuing the Executive Order 10.\n\n\u201cThe country is run on the basis of the rule of law,\u201d Justice Mohammed said in the lead majority judgment.\n\nHowever, in her dissenting judgment, Justice Abba-Aji, held that President Buhari was in order as the Executive Order 10 was aimed at enhancing the provisions of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cthe action of the president is justifiable taking into consideration the hanky panky subterfuge played by state governors against the independence and financial autonomy of state judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt is a pitiable eyesore what judicial officers and staff go through financially at the hands of state executives, who often flout constitutional and court orders to their whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cThus, the presidential Executive Order 10 is meant to facilitate the implementation of the constitutional provisions\u2026the Executive Order is to aid the states\u2019 legislature and judiciary in curing the constitutional wrong of their financial autonomy which the states have always denied. This is not unconstitutional,\u201dAbaa-Aji held.\n\nMeanwhile, on the demand by the plaintiffs that the defendant be ordered to assume responsibility of funding of capital projects of the three courts, four out of the justices however held that the federal government cannot bear responsibility of current and capital expenditures of the affected courts.\n\nThe Justices, who included Mohammed, Nweze, Aba-aAji and Ogunwunmiju, also refused to grant reliefs of the states for payment of N66 billion being expenses incurred so far on capital projects for the three courts in their respective states.\n\nThe four Justices upheld the opposition of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) Abubakar Malami, SAN, and two other senior lawyers, Mahmud Magaji, SAN, and Musibau Adetunmbi, SAN, on the issue, which submitted that capital projects for the three courts should be funded by the states and not by the federal government.\n\nThe apex court\u2019s Justices specifically agreed with Adetunmbi, SAN, who was one of the amici curiae, that the 1999 Constitution has sufficiently provided the manner the federal and states should fund their courts.\n\nThey further upheld his submission that part of the load that the Constitution wants the federal government to carry is narrowed down in Section 84 (7), while Section 121 also narrows down the load it wants the state governments to carry.\n\nAdetunmbi\u2019s opposition against the Executive Order 10 and his prayer that it should be declared illegal, unconstitutional, voided and set aside was also upheld.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The apex court said by the Order, President Buhari usurped the powers of heads of other arms of government.\nAccording to the majority decision, the Executive Order 10 was inconsistent with the 1999 Constitution and therefore unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\nThe President has overstepped the limit of his constitutional powers by issuing the Executive Order 10.\n\u201cThus, the presidential Executive Order 10 is meant to facilitate the implementation of the constitutional provisions\u2026the Executive Order is to aid the states\u2019 legislature and judiciary in curing the constitutional wrong of their financial autonomy which the states have always denied.\nAdetunmbi\u2019s opposition against the Executive Order 10 and his prayer that it should be declared illegal, unconstitutional, voided and set aside was also upheld.",

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nBorno State Governor, Babagana Zulum yesterday gave an indication that the 2023 presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will be determined by consensus, saying the party will rely on President Muhammadu Buhari, its governors and other party leaders \u201cto decide on who emerges as the presidential flag-bearer of the party.\u201d\n\nSpeaking while welcoming members of the Pro-Osinbajo Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG) to his office in Maiduguri, Zulum said contending interests in the forthcoming presidential primaries and other elections will not stop the APC from establishing a consensus that would consolidate party unity and national progress.\n\nHe emphasised that Borno State will work with the party\u2019s hierarchy, members of the National Assembly, and leaders at ward and state levels to ensure actualisation of decisions to be made by Buhari who is the party\u2019s leader.\n\nMembers of the pro-Osinbajo PCG met with Zulum, the Secretary to Borno State Government, Alhaji Usman Jidda Shuwa, and members of the state cabinet with a strong message on the need for a united front towards making Professor Yemi Osinbajo President in 2023.\n\nZulum: \u201cI am solidly behind initiatives aimed towards enhancing the unity of our party and progress of Nigeria; at this crucial time, no one and nothing will prevent the party from moving in unison.\n\n\u201cWe have to identify the right individuals to lead the nation and the task requires governors, party hierarchy and the President working together in concert.\n\n\u201cIndividual aspirations may have to be downplayed because we all have to concur with the decision of the leader of our party.\n\n\u201cBorno State under me will promote unity and all efforts to ensure the success of APC; we shall work with the party hierarchy, our leaders at the National Assembly and our party leaders at ward and state levels, to arrive at best solutions for taking the country forward.\u201d.\n\nZulum emphasised his humble beginnings as a village boy, adding that his major priority is seeing how the people of Borno State would do well within a flourishing economic climate that is achievable in Nigeria.\n\nEarlier, Chairman of the PCG, Dr. Aliyu Rabiu Kurfi stressed the need for Zulum, other state governors, and party leaders at the ward, state and federal levels to forge a consensus towards making Osinbajo Nigeria\u2019s next president.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo deserves the right of first refusal and even in a crowded race with great individuals, he stands out as an insider with the right level of competence and intellect to do the job better than all others,\u201d said the PCG chieftain.\n\nHe urged party leaders to reach a solid consensus on ensuring that Osinbajo become Nigeria\u2019s next President in 2023, adding that self-discipline, moral qualities and competency demonstrated during President Buhari\u2019s absence has made Osinbajo the best candidate for APC\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nSome of those on the PCG entourage to Borno State were its Deputy Chairman (North), Mr. Musa Liman Kwande; its Deputy Chairman (South), Dr. Ebenezer Faji; and former Managing Director of African Petroleum Plc, Shettima Abba-Gana who was a former commissioner in Borno State.\n\nOthers were the PCG Women Leader, Hajia Rabi Dauda; Barrister Emmanuel Pippa (Publicity Secretary); and Mr. Jeff O.

          "title": "Confusion as 4 Oil Companies Named by NNPC as Liable for Imported Substandard Petrol Deny Accusation",
          "text": "Peter Uzoho\n\nFour of the oil companies accused by the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mele Kyari, of importing substandard petrol have all in writing denied the allegation, thus creating more confusion in the drive to unmask shippers of the bad fuel.\n\nIn their separate publications, the four companies \u2013 MRS, Emadeb, Brittania-U and Oando \u2013 vehemently denied importing the high methanol petrol that is unacceptable in Nigeria.\n\nOnly Duke Oil, NNPC\u2019s trading arm, also engaged in the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase arrangement with NNPC, has been mute about the allegation of importing the bad fuel.\n\nSurprisingly, the NNPC boss has been silent about the renunciations by the companies he earlier accused of importing the toxic fuel. Efforts to speak to Kyari on the issue last night proved abortive.\n\nA source told THISDAY last night that NNPC\u2019s Duke Oil is the most likely source of the entire bad fuel and that Kyari was trying to be clever by half, by lumping it on some other DSDP contractors.\n\nThe source added: \u201cYou can see that he (Kyari) kept quiet immediately the denials of the accused companies started rolling in. He has nothing to say again. Kyari has been economical with the truth.\u201d\n\nHowever, before Kyari\u2019s revelation, MRS had in a newspaper advertorial last Wednesday, in response to reports linking it with the saga, stated that it remained a responsible corporate citizen and would not be involved in the purchase, importation, distribution or marketing of substandard petroleum products in the country.\n\nMRS said: \u201cDue to the current subsidy regime, NNPC is the sole supplier of all PMS in Nigeria. Consequently, the NNPC through their trading arm, Duke Oil, supplied a cargo of PMS purchased from international trader Litasco and delivered it with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. This vessel discharged in Apapa between the 24th and 30th of January, 2022.\u201d\n\nAs one of the beneficiaries, MRS said it received the product in its depot and distributed it to only eight of its stations in Lagos.\n\nIn its reaction to the allegation, Brittania-U, in a public notice in newspapers yesterday, denied involvement in the importation of the off-spec petrol in circulation.\n\nThe management of Brittania-U exonerated the company from the ongoing controversy over off-spec Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) in circulation in the country, saying its products that arrived and discharged during 4th to 19th January, 2022, through five daughter vessels, were duly certified as meeting NNPC\u2019s product specifications.\n\n\u201cBrittania-U management is aware of the publication by Emadeb/Hyde/AYMaikifi consortium partners and while we do not want to join issues with these companies, we want to affirm that what they stated does not relate to the issues at hand,\u201d the company stated.\n\nIt maintained that its record in the oil and gas industry, which covers the entire spectrum of upstream, midstream and downstream was impeccable, saying it had remained consistent and compliant and had never fallen foul of any infraction by regulatory authorities since it commenced operation.\n\nBrittania-U stated categorically that it never imported off-spec products, as claimed in publications making the rounds, \u201cas our imported products were all as per NNPC product quality requirements, so to state otherwise will be unfair.\u201d\n\nBrittania-U continued: \u201cOur imported products from our mother vessel, MT Torm Hilde, met all NNPC/NMDPRA product specifications, and we\u2019re duly cleared by DPR (now NMDPRA) in line with Appendix 1 of the NNPC-DSDP Agreement.\n\n\u201cAll the PMS from our mother vessel, MT Torm Hilde were discharged with all relevant certificate of quality after laboratory analysis as it was adjudged lead-free, ethanol-free, water-free, suspended matter-free and had a sulphur content of 0.0174 as against 0.05, which is within the acceptable content allowable by Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Authority\u2026\u201d\n\nIt explained further that the quality certification and its recertification issued at the point of discharge by NMDPRA cleared all the vessels as being on-spec.\n\n\u201cBrittania-U is concerned that while its consortium products had been discharged at retail outlets in January, it was unwittingly now being linked with an issue of off-spec fuel-induced scarcity that began around Monday, the 7th of February, 2022.\n\n\u201cIn order to clear our company\u2019s name, we have made all the documents available, which clearly exonerated our company from the negative publication making rounds, which are all aimed at trying to tarnish our image of repute built over the decade,\u201d the company added.\n\nAlso reacting to the allegation, Emadeb-consortium on Thursday exonerated itself from having a hand in the importation of bad fuel, saying listing it among those partly responsible for the importation of the off-specification petrol by the NNPC was misleading.\n\nThe group in a statement issued in Abuja by the Lead Consortium, Emadeb Energy Services Limited, immaturely urged NNPC to single out Brittania-U, an initial member of the coalition, which it claimed opted out of the arrangement instead of lumping everyone in the consortium together.\n\nAn analyst told THISDAY last night that members of the consortium had been operating independently since the signing of the DSDP contract with NNPC, and urged Emadeb Energy Services to speak for itself instead of trying to blackmail Brittania-U.\n\nOn its part, Oando Plc., in a rejoinder issued Thursday night and signed by the Company\u2019s Secretary, Ayotola Jagun, denied any involvement in the importation of methanol-blended petrol into the country.\n\nOando stated, \u201cFollowing media reports listing Oando as one of four importers that supplied methanol-blended Premium Motor Spirits (PMS) into the country, we hereby state that Oando did not import and supply PMS that was adulterated or substandard. The PMS supplied by Oando met Nigeria\u2019s import specification.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to working assiduously with the NNPC and industry to identify the root cause(s) of the subsequent contamination of the PMS supplied.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure the public that Oando as a responsible corporate citizen would not partake in the importation, distribution, or marketing of substandard petroleum products.\u201d\n\nHowever, since all the companies mentioned in connection with the importation of this adulterated fuel (except Duke Oil) have denied culpability, the million dollar question on the lips of many concerned Nigerians is, who then imported this off-spec petrol that has caused pains and embarrassment to the government and people of Nigeria?\n\nWhere was the NMDPRA when this dirty fuel arrived on the high sea, landed at the Atlas Cove, discharged into smaller vessels to depots and finally made it to the market without detection by the agency that ought to be up and doing as a new creation of the law?\n\nThe subsequent stoppage of off-spec petrol sales by marketers resulted in the disruption of petrol supply chain and attendant scarcity and queues in some parts of the country, particularly Lagos, Ogun, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and other cities, since last weekend.\n\nThe product has caused severe pains to unsuspecting users, with some now suffering damage done to their vehicles and generators after using the bad petrol.\n\nAngered by the ugly development, the federal government has ordered a full scale investigation into the matter to unmask the culprits for appropriate sanction.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Made in Nigeria, only for Nigerians",
          "text": "After celebrating \u201cMade in Nigeria, Enjoyed Worldwide\u201d in my previous article, I was immediately confronted with the other side of our beloved country as we slipped into the \u201cOnly in Nigeria\u201d mode again. It emerged that motorists had unknowingly been buying off-spec petrol. Their car engines were getting damaged. Apparently, the authorities tried to downplay things despite complaints. But the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) finally admitted on Tuesday that petrol with methanol quantities above specification was discovered in the supply chain. This, sadly, reminds me of my series on our disgraceful peculiarities in Nigeria.\n\nTo be sure, there is nothing wrong with methanol being blended with what we call premium motor spirit (PMS) in Nigeria but which some countries call gasoline and or simply petrol. Blending is part of the innovative steps to deal with the negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment. Methanol, according to the experts, is a clean burning, high octane blending component. It is made from non-petroleum energy sources such as natural gas, coal and biomass. Because it burns slower, it is also supposed to last longer and reduce fuelling costs. Methanol was introduced commercially in the 1980s to help slow down the volume of petrol consumption and reduce demand for crude oil.\n\nThere are two challenges I can see immediately. One, how much methanol should be in the petrol blend? Two, how many engines in Nigeria are \u201cconfigured\u201d to be able to consume the methanol blend? From what we have read so far, the methanol content of the imported petrol is above acceptable levels. But even if it is within limit, is it safe for all the car engines in Nigeria? Ethanol, I have to quickly add, is also a form of renewable fuel. It is made from plant materials. Like methanol, it burns slowly and is clean, and is thus environment-friendly. But as with methanol, too, there is a limit to how much should be mixed with a litre of petrol before it becomes \u201cbad fuel\u201d, as we call it.\n\nNow, this is why the latest development comes under the ambit of my \u201cMade in Nigeria, Only for Nigerians\u201d series, which I started in 2005 to highlight how we keep embarrassing ourselves before the rest of the world with amateurism and incompetence. For a start, it is a thing of monumental shame that for decades, we have been importing petroleum products without any exit date in view. It became a norm under military rule and we were told then that it was because family members of the rulers were the ones handling the import contracts. I remember when \u201cfoul fuel\u201d flooded the market under Gen Sani Abacha, nobody was held accountable because, as we learnt, it was in-house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMilitary exited and democracy entered. President Olusegun Obasanjo ruled Nigeria for eight years, from 1999 to 2007, and the refineries still did not work. We kept importing petroleum products despite all the money pumped into turn around maintenance. President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua was there, or thereabouts, for three years. He revoked the privatisation of two refineries and promised to make them work. They did not work. President Goodluck Jonathan called the shots for five years. The refineries still did not work as we kept importing products. President Muhammadu Buhari has now spent close to seven years and the refineries are still not working and we are still importing.\n\nNigeria is such a peculiar country that we have devised all kinds of schemes to whitewash the sepulchres. Initially, we were doing direct importation of products by awarding contracts to marketers and rent collectors. We paid them trillions of naira for imported products \u2014 both real and imagined. We went through the era of fuel subsidy scam as private jets started filling up our skies, owned mostly by brief case-carrying buccaneers who gave their occupation as \u201coil and gas\u201d. Then we graduated to all kinds of terminologies: offshore processing arrangements, swap deals, and now direct sales, direct purchase (DSDP) \u2014 all contrived to package and deodorise our incompetence.\n\nBut this is what pains me to no end: for a country that is so import-dependent \u2014 relying heavily on foreign goods to meet strategic supplies whose disruption can result in a crippling crisis \u2014 it is incredible that we do not have the capacity to do certain things right. We imported and sold off-spec petrol simply because we do not have the capacity to test for methanol content. Addressing the media on Wednesday night, Mallam Mele Kyari, the GMD of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Ltd, put it bluntly: \u201cOur discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the tests for percent methanol content and therefore the additive was not detected by our quality inspectors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI need to get this right. NNPC partners with some companies to bring in petroleum products. NNPC pays them with the domestic crude allocation for our dead refineries. We know that outside Nigeria, there are different gasoline blends \u2014 methanol and ethanol. However, we only test for ethanol. We cannot and do not test for methanol. We have never tested for methanol. We, therefore, take the suppliers by their word and sell the product to Nigerians. Wonderful. This is Nigeria unedited. Now we want to probe. The noise is all over the place. But, pardon me, why \u2014 and how \u2014 would you hold people responsible for what you didn\u2019t specify and didn\u2019t test? I think we are generally joking.\n\nAnd it is not just petrol. Fake and substandard drugs and electrical cables and several products enter our country without strict assessment. Nigerians are being harmed by fake drugs and houses are getting burnt by fake electrical cables. We move on. Is it not Nigeria, a country where anything goes? We do things that cannot pass the common-sense test, much less suggest that we take ourselves seriously. We behave like a group of people who do not have the capacity or capability to think much less apply simple solutions to simple problems. I wish I could understand why we do some of the things we do. Something tells you Nigeria can be better run than this. How did we get here?\n\nSimple question: what would it take to put the requisite equipment and procedures in place to test imported fuels? Did we need consultants from the moon to advise us that we should test our petroleum products properly before we sell to the public? Is this thing as complicated as brain surgery, or rocket science, or even Sudoku? Our legendary amateurism and incompetence are what I call \u201cMade in Nigeria, Only for Nigerians\u201d. They stick out like a sore thumb. They belittle you as a Nigerian and make you feel like Nigeria is still in the Stone Age. You and I know that nothing will come out of this. Remind me, who was punished for the off-spec petrol imported in 2008?\n\nWe are full of plenty nonsense. On Wednesday, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, presided over by the president, met and announced that it had granted citizenship to 286 foreign nationals. The highest ruling executive body in the land? I stand to be corrected but where else in the world does this happen? Citizenship is a routine process for civil servants to handle \u2014 at best under the purview of a director in the ministry of interior acting on behalf of the minister. But this is what a 21st century FEC considers as work. They are not satisfied with their low-level routine of announcing contract awards every Wednesday. Who did this to us?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother product \u201cMade in Nigeria, Only for Nigerians\u201d \u2014 and not fit for export \u201cto be enjoyed around the world\u201d \u2014 is the educational requirement for political office holders as enshrined in the constitution. Nigeria has hundreds of universities, colleges of education and polytechnics. Students are expected to graduate with degrees and diplomas and do the national service for one year. Without the NYSC discharge certificate, it is illegal to be employed. But you know what? To become a governor or president, you don\u2019t need more than secondary school education \u201cor its equivalent\u201d. It is easier to qualify to be elected president or governor than to qualify to be graduate trainee.\n\nI have tried to understand the thinking behind this law. The assumption is that it was to accommodate the educationally disadvantaged parts. But I doubt if this can withstand scrutiny. From the 1960s, all parts of Nigeria have been producing highly educated people. As of 1979 when the provision was slotted into the constitution, there was no state in Nigeria that did not have graduates and even PhDs and professors. We perennially spend billions on constitution amendment (that is the \u201coil block\u201d of the deputy senate president and deputy speaker) but we have avoided amending simple provisions that can add some quality to governance. We play too much in Nigeria.\n\nI can go on and on, but enough said for today. Still, I cannot ignore the drama surrounding Mr Abba Kyari, the deputy commissioner of police who was indicted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the case involving Ramon Abbas aka Hushpuppi, a self-confessed international fraudster. While still under suspension over the allegations, Kyari had the effrontery to be attending social events organised by his bosses and posting pictures, on social media, he took with a character under EFCC probe over suspicion of money laundering. Apparently, Kyari is well connected in the Nigerian system and was only showing us the middle finger and asking us to do our worst. Made in Nigeria.\n\nWe have perfected a way of embarrassing ourselves before the rest of the world. When you know the capacity that Nigeria has, when you see how many Nigerians are working hard day and night in their little corners to make this country better, when you realise that some Nigerians really want to fly the green-white-green flag proudly, you cannot but be dismayed at how we keep messing up at simple and straight-forward things. Nigeria can be far better than this. We have all it takes to be compared to the best societies across the globe. But some people in critical positions of power and authority are clearly not putting in a decent shift. That is why we look like amateurs. Disheartening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nEXECUTIVE DISORDER\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday nullified President Buhari\u2019s Executive Order 10 which he signed in May 2021 to grant financial autonomy to the legislature and the judiciary in the states. The order empowers the accountant-general of the federation to deduct funds for the state legislature and the judiciary from the federation allocations to the states. The court ruled, by 6-1, that the federal government exceeded its constitutional powers. Actually, executive orders are being misused in Nigeria. They are meant to fill a lacuna on a temporary basis until proper laws are passed. They are not meant to amend the constitution or usurp legislative functions. Buhari was misadvised. Blunder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSOAKED AWAY\n\nMs Ajibola Heritage Ayomikun, a 200-level student of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile Ife, died tragically on Wednesday when she fell into a soakaway close to her hostel. The school said it tried everything possible to save her but she was pronounced dead at the OAU Teaching Hospital Complex. The student, who was studying linguistics and African languages, is yet another Nigerian that has died under avoidable circumstances. Our poor application and enforcement of standards will continue to hurt us, but what will keep hurting us the more is that nobody will be held responsible for the state of the soakaway. We just move on, until the next tragedy happens. Cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCHILD ABUSE\n\nHere we go again. A two-year-old pupil of a private school in Lagos state has been reportedly beaten \u201cmercilessly\u201d for being unable to recite the English alphabets. We need to move decisively against such violence towards a toddler. But I see a fundamental problem: at two, kids should be learning colours and shapes and how to co-ordinate their hands through the use of sands and play dough. We have a serious problem with the education system in Nigeria: the curriculum is tailored towards cramming and recitation rather than building the IQ and imparting knowledge. We are programmed to cram and pass exams without developing the IQ to become creative and innovative. Backward.\n\nTRUCKER TROUBLE\n\nFor weeks, protesting Canadian truck drivers have blocked major roads over COVID vaccine mandates for cross-border travellers. They have paralysed socio-economic activities. The government of Ontario province has declared a state of emergency. Blocking crucial infrastructure is now punishable by imprisonment and fines, while driving licences of the violators could be cancelled. \u201cYour right to make a political statement does not outweigh the right of hundreds of thousands of workers to earn their living,\u201d the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, said. An Ontario judge has allowed police to use force to remove those blocking a major bridge to America. Obviously, it is not only in Nigeria that some protesters don\u2019t seem to know when enough is enough. Overacting.",

We play too much in Nigeria.\n\nI can go on and on, but enough said for today. Still, I cannot ignore the drama surrounding Mr Abba Kyari, the deputy commissioner of police who was indicted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the case involving Ramon Abbas aka Hushpuppi, a self-confessed international fraudster. While still under suspension over the allegations, Kyari had the effrontery to be attending social events organised by his bosses and posting pictures, on social media, he took with a character under EFCC probe over suspicion of money laundering. Apparently, Kyari is well connected in the Nigerian system and was only showing us the middle finger and asking us to do our worst. Made in Nigeria.\n\nWe have perfected a way of embarrassing ourselves before the rest of the world. When you know the capacity that Nigeria has, when you see how many Nigerians are working hard day and night in their little corners to make this country better, when you realise that some Nigerians really want to fly the green-white-green flag proudly, you cannot but be dismayed at how we keep messing up at simple and straight-forward things. Nigeria can be far better than this. We have all it takes to be compared to the best societies across the globe. But some people in critical positions of power and authority are clearly not putting in a decent shift. That is why we look like amateurs. Disheartening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nEXECUTIVE DISORDER\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday nullified President Buhari\u2019s Executive Order 10 which he signed in May 2021 to grant financial autonomy to the legislature and the judiciary in the states. The order empowers the accountant-general of the federation to deduct funds for the state legislature and the judiciary from the federation allocations to the states. The court ruled, by 6-1, that the federal government exceeded its constitutional powers. Actually, executive orders are being misused in Nigeria. They are meant to fill a lacuna on a temporary basis until proper laws are passed. They are not meant to amend the constitution or usurp legislative functions. Buhari was misadvised. Blunder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSOAKED AWAY\n\nMs Ajibola Heritage Ayomikun, a 200-level student of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile Ife, died tragically on Wednesday when she fell into a soakaway close to her hostel. The school said it tried everything possible to save her but she was pronounced dead at the OAU Teaching Hospital Complex. The student, who was studying linguistics and African languages, is yet another Nigerian that has died under avoidable circumstances. Our poor application and enforcement of standards will continue to hurt us, but what will keep hurting us the more is that nobody will be held responsible for the state of the soakaway. We just move on, until the next tragedy happens. Cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCHILD ABUSE\n\nHere we go again. A two-year-old pupil of a private school in Lagos state has been reportedly beaten \u201cmercilessly\u201d for being unable to recite the English alphabets. We need to move decisively against such violence towards a toddler. But I see a fundamental problem: at two, kids should be learning colours and shapes and how to co-ordinate their hands through the use of sands and play dough. We have a serious problem with the education system in Nigeria: the curriculum is tailored towards cramming and recitation rather than building the IQ and imparting knowledge. We are programmed to cram and pass exams without developing the IQ to become creative and innovative. Backward.\n\nTRUCKER TROUBLE\n\nFor weeks, protesting Canadian truck drivers have blocked major roads over COVID vaccine mandates for cross-border travellers. They have paralysed socio-economic activities. The government of Ontario province has declared a state of emergency. Blocking crucial infrastructure is now punishable by imprisonment and fines, while driving licences of the violators could be cancelled. \u201cYour right to make a political statement does not outweigh the right of hundreds of thousands of workers to earn their living,\u201d the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, said. An Ontario judge has allowed police to use force to remove those blocking a major bridge to America. Obviously, it is not only in Nigeria that some protesters don\u2019t seem to know when enough is enough. Overacting.",

          "title": "11 African startups to watch out for in 2022",
          "text": "It\u2019s safe to say the Africa startup ecosystem came full circle last year with a record-breaking number of new innovative startups and huge investment to match it. If innovation is a reflection of economic, social, and technological advancement, then we can say the ecosystem has advanced.\n\nSo, out of hundreds of excellent startups in Africa, we have curated 10 that we think you, our readers, should watch closely as we expect them to do some incredible stuff this year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFintech/cryptocurrency\n\nFounded in February 2020 by Stephen Young, NFTfi is a decentralised and peer-to-peer cryptocurrency loan platform where users can list their NFT collateral to get loan offers from other users.\n\nOn the platform, you can request for a loan using your NFT and other users start bidding to lend you money in cryptocurrency with varying interest rates and repayment terms. Once you accept an offer, you\u2019ll receive wETH or DAI liquidity in your wallet and your NFT is transferred into a double-audited escrow smart contract for the loan duration. If you repay the loan before it expires, you\u2019ll get your NFT back. If you default, the lender can foreclose and receive your NFT.\n\nThis is a good innovation considering the amount of money locked in NFTs. Imagine being able to access liquidity without selling off your NFT.\n\nAs crypto continues to gain mass acceptance and adoption, so does the need to make it easy for holders to transact with it. Lazerpay, founded and launched into beta in November last year by Njoku Emmanuel, is a payment gateway for crypto. Think of Paystack, but for crypto.\n\nLast year, Lazerpay secured an undisclosed amount of investment from Nestcoin, an innovative venture that builds, operates, and invests in crypto and Web3 products. As it\u2019s set to launch to the public, the startup is expected to do to cryptocurrency what Paystack and Flutterwave are doing to fiat in Africa.\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July 2021, GetEquity says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nOn GetEquity, users get to invest as little as $10 in startups. Startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates, and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nAs at December last year, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nFounded by Jesse Ghansah and Barima Effah, Float, formerly known as Swipe, was launched in June 2021 as a cash management and credit provider fintech company for Africa\u2019s fast-growth companies.\n\nThe startup recently picked up $17 million in equity and debt funding from notable investors across the world including Cauris, Tiger Global, and Justin Mateen\u2019s JAM Fund, Ingressive Capital, Magic Fund, and many angel investors.\n\nThe company is already operational in Nigeria and Kenya and the seed round is expected to expedite its growth this year.\n\nLaunched in April last year by Ahmed Sabbah, a co-founder at Swvl and Youssef Sholqamy, a former engineer at Uber, Telda is a digital bank that provides free accounts for its users and enables them to send and receive money. It also provides them with a card to use online, in stores, make withdrawals and pay bills.\n\nIn May, just a month after it launched, the company announced that it has raised $5 million pre-seed funding led by Sequoia. It also affirmed that it is the first company to receive a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under its new regulations to issue cards and onboard customers digitally.\n\nOwing to its achievement in a short period of time, we expect the startup to even achieve more in 2022, so get your eyes peeled on this one.\n\nEdtech\n\nCraydel is an edtech startup that was launched in March 2021 by Manish Sardana, John Nguru, and Shayne Aman Premji. The startup creates a reliable portal to guide African students in their tertiary education, course selection, and career decisions.\n\nCraydel provides a digital end-to-end higher education service. Its service spans from the point of students choosing schools, programmes, and courses to the application and admission stages. The company also provides visa support for those who choose to study abroad, all for free.\n\nCraydel is already in partnership with 90 institutions across Canada, the UK and US, Ireland, and African countries like Malawi and Kenya. There are over 3,000 courses\u2014spread across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes\u2014available to choose from.\n\nFounded in May 2021 but launched into beta in December by former Google Nigeria boss, Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya says it wants to empower learners and their parents to take control of their learning and make it easier for them to access high-quality learning material and expert help.\n\nThe platform is built to target Nigerian secondary school learners. It has raised a $3.5 million pre-seed capital war chest from Target Global and top African founders like Shola Akindolu and Babs Ogundeyin, among others, to bring effective education to its target audience.\n\nWith the founder\u2019s experience, quality of the team, and the early investment secured, we expect this startup to do great things in the edtech sector this year.\n\nHealthtech\n\nBypa-ss was founded by Dr Andrew Saad in 2019 and entered the market with its proprietary product, HealthTag, a platform for Health Information Exchange (HIE), offering physicians a free cloud-based clinic management solution.\n\nThrough linking with a cloud database, HealthTag securely stores medical records collected from different healthcare providers and gives them to their rightful owner, the user.\n\nAs of November last year, Saad said the company currently has over 17,000 HealthTag cardholders and over 3,500 healthcare providers\u2014mainly in clinics, pharmacies, labs, and radiology centers using their product.\n\nBuilt on the blockchain technology, Afya Rekod wants to create a seamless mobilised healthcare in Africa, where the patients\u2014who are the only moving parts in healthcare\u2014own all the rights to their data.\n\nFounded in 2019 by the co-founder and CEO of Adanian Labs John Kamara, Afya Rekod provides 4 unique offerings to its customers: its core patient\u2019s portal; electronic health record systems (EHRs) for hospitals; diagnostic centres for medical labs; and disease management for control and management of chronic diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.\n\nEcommerce and logistics\n\nTendo is a social ecommerce platform that eases setup and operating costs for social commerce entrepreneurs by providing them with logistics, financing, and marketing.\n\nFounded by Derrick Mungai, Evans Darbo Boateng, Felix Manford, and Primerose Katena, Tendo provides a curated catalogue of products, marketing tools, and other tools that facilitate trading for its users\u2014resellers\u2014to choose from. Once they sell the product at their own chosen price, Tendo handles the rest\u2014ships the product, subtracts the cost and remits the profit in the account of the seller.\n\nTendo simply enables anyone to start an online shop with zero capital. The company has a unique solution to social commerce. It also made it into Y Combinator 2022 Winter Batch, and this is an indicator of its potential to be watched closely.\n\nFounded in June 2021 by Tola Onayemi and Tope Obanla, Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks, and patent intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360-degree business launchpad: business registration, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nWe think this startup is building a game-changing product; something that will have a significant impact on the growth of African startups.\n\nWe know you have some startups you are rooting for this year that we might have missed. Please tell us about them in the comment section below.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria has set in motion what could herald a new dawn for African tech startups as it moots the adoption of new listing rules to encourage tech companies to go public.\n\nThis story was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG) is going on a charm offensive to attract tech unicorns to the bourse, in part to resuscitate the market after a lull in new listings.\n\nIts pivot towards fintech firms underpins the coming of age of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem \u2013 now a top destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nNXG is now setting up a NASDAQ-style board to consolidate on the fast-growing internet economy created by local tech firms.\n\nOlumide Bolumole, division head of stock exchange listing activities at NXG revealed that the bourse will make sweeping changes to make listing attractive to tech companies.\n\nHe singled out \u201cbreaking even\u201d, one of the current prerequisites for listing a firm at the bourse, asserting that this requirement was stymieing the growth potential of tech outfits.\n\nNGX demutualised in 2021, taking the company private in a move that it hopes will attract greater flows of foreign and domestic investment into Nigeria\u2019s bourse, with a renewed emphasis on corporate governance and the ability to expand into other markets and sectors.\n\nNGX consists of a holding company and three subsidiaries that cover the operations of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), its regulation, and its real estate. This structure is similar to those of other international market groups such as the London, New York, and Johannesburg stock exchange groups.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria and a few other African states boast unicorns \u2013 startups that have attained a market valuation of over a billion US dollars and Africa is now home to seven: Jumia Technologies, Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, Wave, OPay, and Chipper Cash.\n\nFive of these became unicorns in 2021, including two in September alone, indicating the growing levels of interest in Africa\u2019s startup market not seen before.\n\nBut despite having the fourth-largest stock market in Africa none of Nigeria\u2019s home-grown top startups to date have been listed on the Lagos-based NSE. The proposed reforms should help tech firms tap into larger capital markets, starting at home.\n\nAccording to Wee Tracker (WT), the Nigerian government is in the process of implementing the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSE).\n\nIt will create a new regulatory framework that should allow innovation-driven businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe bill also intends to address prevalent shortcomings such as insufficient digital infrastructure, tax holidays, and capital access,\u201d WT said.\n\nListings for Africa\u2019s tech firms have many benefits, including fundraising and providing a seamless exit route to investors, supervision and control of trading in securities, and fair price for the securities.\n\nTimely disclosure of corporate information and better corporate practice are also some of the advantages of a company going public. Studies have also shown that consumers are often more willing to support listed firms.\n\nFor Nigeria, getting startups to list could help revive the country\u2019s bourse after a three-year listing drought. In recent decades, Nigeria\u2019s stock market capitalisation has fallen well below potential.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the market cap of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) swelled to $1.05 trillion, equivalent to 235% of the country\u2019s 301 billion US dollars GDP,\u201d according to Wee Tracker.\n\nWhile the NSE outperformed in 2020, growing by as much as 50 percent with 4.5 billion dollars in new listings, its market capitalisation of $56.6 billion \u2013 just 13.1% of the nation\u2019s comparatively enormous $432.3 billion GDP \u2013 shows there is considerable room for growth.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "TechCabal\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Gift Guide",
          "text": "Valentine\u2019s is fast approaching and so is the race to win people\u2019s hearts with gifts. For many, the outcome of February 14 will decide if Christmas this year will be celebrated wearing matching pyjamas, or joining unnamed Zikoko team members blocking and muting words like \u201clove\u201d and \u201cme and mines\u201d later.\n\nFor Christmas, we gave you a guide to help you navigate gifting during the holiday season. Now we\u2019ve created this one to help you navigate Valentine\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, even gift-giving. If you\u2019re looking to steer clear of basic gifts like one-time food platters that will be consumed in single sittings, this is the guide for you. For example, James Wardle created a $1 million game\u2014Wordle\u2014for his partner who loved video games. Locket, an app that helps users share their photos to their friends\u2019/lovers\u2019 home screens, was built by Matt Moss as a present for his girlfriend. Even Zoom was the product of a founder who wanted to connect with his girlfriend long distance.\n\nLast year, the African tech ecosystem raised a whopping $4 billion+ so we know things are working. As we invest and build more startups, it\u2019s also important to invest and build relationships. And that\u2019s why you should move away from chocolates and roses to\u2026\n\n1. Professional courses\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nIf you can\u2019t build your partner apps The New York Times will later buy for millions of dollars, at least enrol them in courses where they can learn to build, design, market or manage those apps\u2014for themselves or future lovers. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nThere are a few online schools where you can pay for courses like software engineering, design, product management, marketing, or content creation. Check out AltSchool, Moringa School, Decagon Institute, Coursera, and Pluralsight.\n\nYou should also sign them up for TC Daily, a daily newsletter that can give your lover comprehensive insight into tech.\n\nWe\u2019re always talking about getting more people into tech. Use this Valentine\u2019s and help people kick-start their journey into tech.\n\nPrice range: > $99\n\nWe\u2019ve labelled this a Series C-type gift because it\u2019s a long-term investment beneficial to all involved. It\u2019s expensive but also profitable in the long run. Unless, of course, the giftee gets acquired by another gifter. \ud83d\udc80\n\n2. Music streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: Stuff.tv\n\nThis one is a given.\n\nMusic heals our body, soul, and mind. It\u2019s also one of the greatest ways to connect with people. Over the past 5 years, the growth of streaming services\u2014indigenous and foreign\u2014has doubled.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, get your loved ones subscriptions on Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, and Boomplay.\n\nPrice range: $2 \u2013 $4 (for Individual plans)\n\nWe\u2019re labelling this a seed-type gift because, any way you dice it, you\u2019re sowing seeds. You\u2019re either sowing seeds of \u201cThis is how we chose our wedding songs\u201d, or breakfast seeds that will lead to many Adele playlists. Happy planting. \ud83c\udf31\n\n3. Video streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: The Streamable\n\nEver heard of Netflix and Chill? Well, here\u2019s how you can someday build up to that: get them video streaming subscriptions for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nWith multiple plans to choose from, Iroko TV and Netflix have been giving us really amazing African content in the past few years.\n\nGet a Nollywood lover an Iroko or Netflix subscription for Valentine\u2019s.\n\nPrice range: From $7 (+ Free basic Netflix plans in Kenya)\n\nThis is also a seed-type gift because it\u2019s affordable and useful if things go sideways. Renewing the subscriptions marks the token of your shared love, and not renewing can be a new way to end the relationship, instead of ghosting.\n\n4. Data subscriptions\n\nLevel: Pre-seed\n\nData is life. And the more of it you have, the more you can access information available online. Data on the continent is still relatively expensive, and in some countries, people can pay as much as $7 for 1GB of data.\n\nAll the digital gifts we\u2019ve listed above are data-dependent so make sure you\u2019re getting your loved ones access to the gifts you give.\n\nWith data, people can stream as many movies and videos as they possibly can. Log on to your MTN, Safaricom, Airtel, or Ethio Telecom services and gift your loved one gigabytes of data.\n\nPrice range: From < $1\n\nThis is the only pre-seed gift here because you can decide how much or how little you want to invest here.\n\n5. Home services\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Yung Nollywood\n\nWhat\u2019s better than one-time food platters? Daily food packages that trump the time-consuming activity of cooking.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, and that includes automating home services like laundry and cooking.\n\nStartups like Eden Life have created platforms where you can subscribe to monthly packages for laundry, cooking and cleaning services. If you\u2019re going to go with the food option for Valentine\u2019s, then go all the way.\n\nPrice range: From $50\n\nThis is labelled Series C because it\u2019s also a long-term gift. Every time your loved one eats or steps into clean rooms and clothes, they\u2019ll think of you and how much you\u2019ve made their lives easier.\n\n6. Crypto\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Corporate Compliance Insights\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue. Crypto is here, and its promise is true.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to talk much about crypto. Like your relationships, it has its ups and downs, \ud83d\udc80 but that\u2019s what makes us love it.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, add to your loved one\u2019s crypto stash and help them build their way into digital wealth. There are many cryptocurrencies to choose from, like bitcoin, ethereum, and doge. And if you\u2019re worried about the chances of the coins depreciating, remember that even your relationship is a gamble.\n\nGet on BuyCoins, Yellow Card, Quidax, Nestcoin, or Bitsika to mine your way into people\u2019s hearts.\n\nPrice range: From $1 (invest as required).\n\nThis is a Series C gift because it\u2019s long-term for both of you. If the relationship dips, you can take comfort in knowing that whenever crypto dips, so will your ex\u2019s happiness.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please give TechCabal a gift by sharing it on Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp or Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This developer transitioned to blockchain development in order to solve Web2 problems",
          "text": "Akinyemi Akindele, 27, studied computer science at the University of Ibadan, where he trained as a Web2 software developer.\n\nHowever, his journey into the blockchain world did not start until he got an internship in 2015 at Interswitch, one of Africa\u2019s earliest unicorns. At Interswitch, he worked in the research and development team where he got the opportunity to test out interesting emerging technologies like AI and blockchain\u2014technologies that the business was not focusing on at that point.\n\nAkindele was neck-deep into the blockchain and soon realised its power. \u201cPeople were talking about the future of finance and I got to work on it early on,\u201d Akindele said. As a Nigerian experiencing the rapid decline in value of the naira, Akindele resonated with bitcoin\u2019s promise to provide a store of value not tied to the traditional financial system or government\u2019s whims.\n\nHe was a man of varied interest, his final year paper at the university was based on artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014with a focus on artificial neural networks. Upon graduating from university, he returned to work at Interswitch and started learning how to develop blockchain solutions. Eventually, he got to build a blockchain supply chain solution with his team, the first of its kind in the country, he said. The blockchain solution made the loaning and contract awarding process involving Dangote Plc bidding suppliers and banks seamless.\n\nAkindele attended hackathons, and ethereum meetups organised by Consensys in Lagos, where he had to build smart contracts on ethereum. He won some\u2014worth 1 to 3 million naira\u2014and that was pivotal to his career growth. He admitted that he won a lot of those hackathons because he already had a lot of experience in building ethereum solutions at his workplace, Interswitch.\n\nIn one of the hackathons, he met an American founder, Daniel Block, who was building an NFT marketplace for properties, as far back as 2018. He was on a mission to tokenise real estate properties in Africa, had digitised land records in Ghana, and had his sights set on Nigeria.\n\nAkindele joined Block\u2019s company, SESO Global, as its first blockchain engineer, where he helped build an NFT marketplace. There, he spent a year building their enterprise ethereum, and wrote smart contract code to power those NFTs\u2014years before the NFT buzz of 2021.\n\nA rich blockchain development experience\n\nIt was in one of those hackathons, where he had been an outstanding competitor, that Akindele met Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin co-founder, who was then director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of global crypto exchange, Binance. Yele was a judge in those hackathons, and he kept in touch with Akindele because of his outstanding performance. So, when Yele needed a team to start a project internally inside Binance, he reached out to Akindele.\n\nAkindele joined Binance\u2014where he was earning about $48,000 per year\u2014as a blockchain engineer, and with a team of backend, mobile, and blockchain engineers, helped build a cryptocurrency exchange right from the scratch. \u201cIt was interesting because we got to learn a lot of new things. For example, I did a lot of encryption, wallet generation, and signing off; and I got to know a lot of different coins listed on the exchange.\u201d\n\nAkindele recalled that the project commenced when Facebook announced Libra, a cryptocurrency, wallet and an exchange, all in one. \u201cIt looked like the hottest thing ever!\u201d Akindele further explained that Binance was worried Facebook might take over developing countries due to the proposed Libra\u2019s reach, so Binance started a competing project, which gave birth to Bundle Africa.\n\nAt the time, Bundle Africa ran as a startup inside Binance and was also a remote-first company. Within 16 months, Bundle Africa got 650,000 users, majorly by word of mouth, community marketing, and a small marketing budget. The way its adoption skyrocketed made Akindele realise the huge potential crypto products had.\n\nAfter two years at Binance, Akindele joined EMTECH, a US blockchain company that builds digital currency for central banks across the world. At EMTECH\u2014where he was earning about $84, 000 per year\u2014he helped build tokens, did DevOps work and helped in shipping projects. EMTECH had created the world\u2019s first CBDC for the Bahamas and was the go-to fintech company for central banks looking to create digital currencies.\n\nBreaking into blockchain development\n\nAnother idea that endeared Akindele to blockchain engineering was that the blockchain was a melting point for a lot of things. \u201cTo be very good at blockchain you have to know things beyond your engineering skills, like finance, and compliance and regulations. You have to think about these things every time you write a code or develop anything.\u201d\n\nAkindele believes that anyone who wants to transition into becoming a Web3 developer must believe that it is the future. \u201cYou have to convince yourself because no one is coming to convince you that ownership rights on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be big in the future.\u201d\n\nHe further advised aspiring blockchain developers to learn how to build on a popular blockchain like ethereum, develop ethereum Decentralised applications (Dapps) and write Solidity code. \u201cIt is at this point you will realise that you have new powers because you would be able to write smart contracts, deploy them on a public blockchain and see people interacting with your blockchain.\u201d\n\nSolving problems with Web3\n\nAkindele left EMTECH to found a startup, BetDemand, a decentralised finance (DeFi) sport betting platform where every player who lose their bets still get their initial staking.\n\nThe idea for BetDemand came to him while he studied game theory to understand why and how people play games and the economic models designed as part of those games. He discovered that economic incentives in the traditional sports betting model are harmful: a large number of people were losing money but couldn\u2019t stop playing because they were already addicted to betting.\n\nBetDemand eliminates the major problem people have with betting: losing their money. \u201cImagine telling a punter that even if he loses, he will get his money back after a week. That is an irresistible offer,\u201d Akindele said. Players can only bet on football for now, with naira\u2014for as low as \u20a650\u2014and crypto.\n\nBetDemand gathers all the money staked by players in a single pool, introducing a lock-up period of 1 week, where players do not receive their money back until after a week. During this lock-up period, BetDemand converts this pool of funds to USDT, a stablecoin, which would then be deposited in Venus protocol, a DeFi lending and borrowing platform. The pool of funds then earns 12% to 15% annual percentage yield (APY).\n\n\u201cEverybody gets their money back at the end of the day, whether you win or lose, and the interest we get during the lock-up period is shared with the winners.\u201d\n\nAkindele explained that they could have opted for other coins that would raise their yield to as high as 30% but, right now, they are sticking with USDT because stablecoins are non-volatile. They make less profit but it\u2019s just enough to sustain the business.\n\nIn the last week of October, when BetDemand launched, the size of its pool of funds was $450; now it has increased to $26,000 per week.\n\nBetDemand calculates winnings by multiplying the amount that players bet by total odds\u2014a method not particularly different from how traditional betting companies calculate winnings. The day of the week in which one places a bet also affects winnings; it\u2019s called the \u201cday factor\u201d. The difference with BetDemand, however, is that payouts are based on the interest the pool of funds yields over the week, so players can\u2019t earn as high as they would with traditional betting. \u201cBut what we pay is enough to keep people coming back.\u201d\n\nLike the buzzy play-to-earn gaming Web3 companies, BetDemand is charting its course as a DeFi gaming company. And, although, yet to be announced, it has raised an angel round and is in the process of closing a pre-seed round.\n\nAkindele, speaking about what Web3 will do for Africa, said, \u201cWeb3 will be very big for Africa, because when the internet was being built in Silicon Valley, a lot of Africans did not participate in that. But we have a chance to do so now. Every time new technologies are built, a lot of wealth is created around that period, and people involved in building these technologies, or those that exist at the time, benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe advised developers hoping to start their blockchain engineering journey to join communities on Discord, connect with people, and ask questions, especially from founders, to see why they make the decisions they make. He also advised them to contribute to open source blockchain projects and look for ways to solve the problems that exist today in Web2 with Web3.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nThe rate at which Africans use the Internet for cybercrime is alarming and rapidly increasing. Cybercrime affects all countries, but Africa is particularly vulnerable due to inadequate network and security.\n\nAn estimate shows that cybercrime costs the global economy $500 billion, as of 2016. A 2021 study by Techshielder, a technology and online security platform, describes Nigeria as the second most notorious country in the world for romance scams, after the Philippines.\n\nIf I continue with the types of fraud and the countries that top each list, it won\u2019t be surprising to see an African country on every list, which is very worrisome. For instance, South Africa, after Kenya, is the African country most affected by fraud, draining millions of dollars from the mobile accounts of cellular users worldwide on a daily basis, according to research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Evina, a French cybersecurity firm with a presence in more than 70 countries worldwide \u2013 including 15 in Africa \u2013 a recent report titled State of Mobile Fraud in Africa, shows that professional cybercriminals targeting Africa\u2019s one billion mobile phone users continue to be a significant problem.\n\nTo fight this, the company which claims to specialise in fighting fraud in Africa has recently raised a \u20ac20 million (~$23m) Series A to help them improve their game in fighting fraud.\n\nI find that interesting because the company declared that at least half of the \u20ac20 million capital injection will be used to combat fraud in Africa. Yes, you read that correctly; over $12 million will be invested in combating mobile fraud in Africa.\n\nWhile I\u2019m interested in how the company intends to accomplish this, there\u2019s also an indigenous company in Nigeria, Stellas digital bank planning to combat fraud. But before I discuss that, let\u2019s see what happens to your data when you die.\n\nSide bar: Is it possible that the rise of startups focused on combating fraud will help achieve its purpose in Africa? What do you think? Please, click the reply button to respond.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to your data when you die?\n\nWho will have access to your accounts if you die right now? Do your siblings or parents have access to all of your digital assets?\n\nNot to scare you, but those thoughts were playing through my head about a fortnight ago. What if, despite my optimism, I kick the bucket without any warning? What will happen to my social media accounts, email accounts, and the small sums of money I\u2019ve saved in Cowrywise and Piggyvest if I don\u2019t wake up again after tonight? I mean, I\u2019d like my family to have it, but how likely is that after I die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so many daily functions, tasks, and memories now taking place online, the question of what will become of your digital legacy \u2013 who will preserve, control, or delete your accounts after you die \u2013 has become increasingly important.\n\nMaking a plan now can help you avoid identity theft, save documents and records you want to keep, and keep your friends and family from receiving painful pop-up reminders on social media.\n\nHowever, there are numerous potential stumbling blocks to organising your digital will, ranging from privacy concerns and cybersecurity to copyright.\n\nBut, where does your data go when you die in Africa, where you technically have no rights to your data after death?\n\n\n\nIn the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu walked us through what happens to our data when we die. Please read, where does your data go when you die?\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme in 2011, interbank transactions in Nigeria have become much faster, with several experts hailing it as one of the best globally.\n\nFraudsters have also taken advantage of this, executing faster due to the increased speed. Consequently, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime in the last decade and $12 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nBecause fraud remains a problem for both digital and traditional banks, Stellas digital bank \u2014 a microfinance bank founded in 2017 to provide easy access to financial services \u2014 has launched a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? The company plans to protect user identities when conducting transactions to prevent identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nBut how is the Bukola Solomon-led company doing that? To know how, please, read: Stellas digital bank launches, plans to fix major loophole for fintech fraud in Nigeria.\n\nPoS for the web\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending money from one bank to another 25 years ago was a very different process than it is today. Transfers frequently took several days to reach their intended recipients. To withdraw money, you had to go to the branch where you opened your account.\n\n\n\nHowever, banking innovation has caused the industry to evolve to the point where transfers can now be completed in a matter of minutes. And the industry has grown at an unprecedented rate due to these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more people shopping online, digital payments have become the order of the day, with startups introducing new features to aid this \u2014 like a Point-of-Sale (PoS) solution for the web, for instance. Thepeer, a startup that creates infrastructure that allows businesses to share data, has launched Checkout to create a simple online checkout experience.\n\nCheckout, according to the startup, is simple to integrate and use on a business\u2019s website. Users can shop online and pay from their favourite businesses using Thepeer Checkout.\n\nTo know what the startup does, please read: Backed by Flutterwave, Thepeer wants to help businesses share data seamlessly using its API\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMental health advice to my younger self. Read.\n\nScience vs God: Watch.\n\nThe prison of your mind | Watch.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThepeer is hiring an android engineer on contract for 3 months.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2011, interbank transactions have gotten much faster in Nigeria with the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme, an infrastructure that several experts laud as being one of the world\u2019s best.\n\nUnfortunately, this speed of execution meant that fraudsters have been able to execute with greater speed. In 10 years, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime, and in just nine months of 2020, it lost $12 million to electronic fraud.\n\nNigeria\u2019s banking space is, perhaps, one of its most critical sectors, as these companies are tasked with providing essential services to millions of people. Interestingly, we\u2019re observing a trend of banks moving from physical branches to having an online-only presence.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not clear how much Nigerian consumer behaviour has adapted to this trend, investors are seemingly betting that these companies will usher in the future of banking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith different incentives and hooks like free transfers, micro-lending, speedy and efficient customer lending, these banks aim to capture segments of the market that have experienced relative neglect by traditional banks.\n\nHowever, fraud remains the bane of both digital banks, and traditional banks alike. For the newly launched Stellas digital bank, it plans to guard against one major loophole.\n\nLed by Bukola Solomon, an executive with extensive experience in the investment banking space, Stellas microfinance bank started in 2017, to provide easy access to financial services, and it soon became one of Nigeria\u2019s leading financial services providers.\n\nToday, the company is launching a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease\u201d. With this launch, it plans to promote privacy and security in the financial services space with its \u201cGhost Mode\u201d feature, as well as other savings and budgeting features, but more on these later.\n\nSolomon explains that the company has always prioritised user experience as one of its biggest value offerings, and it brought that philosophy with its digital banking launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen several instances of people who need to make transactions but want it to remain confidential and private. With our Ghost Mode feature, you can execute confidential transactions, and more so, it serves as a security feature. We can encrypt transactions so that even if they get access to your phone or that of the recipient, your data is secure,\u201d he says.\n\nBasically, Stellas plans to protect user identities when making transactions, to guard against identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nIn 2020, $219 million was lost to identity theft, and these usually come in different forms from social media activities, emails, or credit cards. Solomon points out that transferring money to a random stranger you bought items from could be another potential loophole for identity theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolomon also reveals that all transactions are fully insured by the National Deposit Insurance Commission (NDIC) and will strictly comply with anti-money laundering and anti-fraud regulations.\n\nInteresting bells and whistles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Solomon talks up the Ghost Mode feature, he also reveals that the company has integrated a budgeting feature that would help users create better economic plans for themselves.\n\nSo far, Solomon claims it already has a massive userbase with exciting projections for the future.\n\n\u201cWe have 10,000 users already, and we expect it to reach 200,000 in the first month.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s highly likely that Stellas would be offering its digital banking services to its existing customers, but it would be interesting to see how it would ht 200k users in one month.\n\nIn a space graced by the likes of Kuda, Sparkle, Fairmoney, and Carbon, Nigeria\u2019s digital banking space look set to be exciting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "IMF sees Nigeria risks financial squeeze as debt piles",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nigeria\u2019s decade-long rise in public debt could create both financial as well as revenue squeeze for the economy in the medium term.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s mission chief for Nigeria, Jesmin Rahman in the IMF/Nigeria 2021 article IV consultation staff press conference stated that though the country\u2019s current debt dynamics at the moment seem favourable as it still resides within the 30 percent threshold, its trajectory, however, would become a major economic concern in the medium term.\n\n\u201cPublic debt threshold for emerging markets stand at 10 percent; however, Nigeria currently spends above 80 percent to service its debt.\n\n\u201cRecent estimates indicate that public debt is to increase from 36 percent to 40 percent in the medium term. Should this happen, it is going to become a major cause for concern for the Nigerian government,\u201d she said.\n\nDebt servicing for Nigeria since the oil decline in 2020 has been dependent on CBN overdraft and Eurobond subscriptions.\n\nThomas Alun, a senior economist at the IMF stated that while Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds are oversubscribed, dependence on Eurobonds however, is quite risky as economic volatility could translate to both financial as well as revenue squeeze for the Nigerian economy which in turn further escalates the country\u2019s rising debt.\n\nHe further stated that Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability or further crisis is dependent on a number of economic factors.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s debt trend is not looking favorable on the debt portfolio end but the estimates are dependent on various economic factors.\n\n\u201cWhether debt becomes stressful or not is dependent on a number of factors like growth, interest rate, oil prices, financing situation in the country amongst others,\u201d Alun said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s debt service is currently suffocating federal spending and by extension is suffocating the general economy and the living conditions of Nigerian households. Accompanying this grim reality is the government\u2019s heavy reliance on oil revenues which has been extremely anemic in the last couple of years.\n\nDwindling oil revenues which emanated in 2020 as a result of the slump in oil prices in the international market due to the covid-19 pandemic, necessitated the Nigerian government to rely heavily on borrowing (both external and domestic), to finance its projects and try to close up budget deficits.\n\nThis notwithstanding has not convinced the Nigerian populace as well as foreign investors\u2019 as to why the country\u2019s borrowing has been significantly rising since 2016 with no evidence (infrastructure or otherwise) to justify it.\n\nDating back to 2015, data culled from the Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that the nation\u2019s external debt stood at $10.31bn and total public debt stood at $63.806bn or N12.1trn within the review period.\n\nSix years down the line (2021), the figure had almost tripled to $37.95bn for foreign debt and $92.626bn or N38.0trn for total public debt as of September 2021, representing a 268 percent increase in external debts and a 214.0 per cent increase in total debts.\n\nIn a failed attempt to sustain these debts, the Federal Government spends trillions of naira yearly servicing more debts.\n\nSince 2017, this administration has spent a total of N15.375trn on debt servicing, excluding N296bn and N110bn allocated for sinking funds in 2019 and 2020.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head of Retail Investment at Chapel Hill Denham told Business Day that when a budget crisis emanates, the capital expenditure which directly impacts the general economy is always at the receiving end.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be talking about having any meaningful growth in the economy if we don\u2019t spend more on capital expenditures, which happens to be the productive sector.\n\n\u201cFrom potholed and often barely paved streets of Lagos to moribund refineries around the country to accident-prone highways on Federal roads to inadequate health and education infrastructure, both Nigerians and foreign investors visiting Nigeria are reminded repeatedly of the country\u2019s urgent need for capital. Many investors, however, continue to be willing lenders, despite obvious signs that their money may not always have been put into the most productive use.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the major reasons why when the base effect is taken out of the equation, we still see that the country\u2019s growth rate is still lagging behind the population growth rate.\n\n\u201cAnother major concerning factor is that recurrent expenditure continues to increase which means that the government would subsequently increase borrowing and as a result, servicing cost would continue to increase which would, in turn, translate to an inefficient budget,\u201d Ebo said.\n\nThis has, as a result, erupted questions by analysts as to whether the public finances of the biggest economy in Africa (Nigeria) are as sustainable as they appear and why the country\u2019s debt has lingered this long and continues to significantly increase.\n\nBetween 2017 till date, the Federal Government has budgeted a total of N19.16trn for capital expenditure (money spent to buy, maintain or improve fixed assets).\n\nData from the Budget Office revealed that in the 2017 fiscal year, the Federal Government spent N2.177trn out of N7.441trn aggregate revenue as capital expenditure. The amount represented 29.25 percent of the total revenue in that year.\n\nFor 2018, N2.873trn was expended on capital projects, which was 31.50 percent of N9.120trn total expenditure.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, N2.090trn and N2.140trn, respectively, were spent as capital expenditure. The figures represented 23.43 percent and 20.71 percent of aggregate expenditure for the years which was N8.920trn and N10.330trn, respectively.\n\nThe amount budgeted for capital expenditure saw an increase in 2021 and 2022 as N4.989trn and N4.891trn were budgeted for capital projects. This shows 34.24 percent and 29.83 percent of aggregate expenditure for the years at N14.570trn and N16.391trn, respectively.\n\nHowever, while presenting the 2021 budget performance, the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed had said that N1.79trn had been spent on capital projects between January and August 2021.\n\nEmeka Ucheaga, the CEO of EUA Intelligence and a financial analyst at Credit Direct limited stated that sub-national debt was also another factor that has played a significant role in elongating the country\u2019s current rising debt debacle.\n\n\u201cMost states generate minimal revenue outside their monthly allocation of Nigeria\u2019s anemic oil income. They depend almost exclusively on monthly allocations of federal revenues, which have been drastically declining in recent times,\u201d he said.\n\nMany states have been borrowing to meet their salary obligations, often at exorbitant interest rates (as high as 25-28 percent). States\u2019 borrowing trends are risky and need to be addressed.\n\nIn 2015, Global Credit Ratings, the African equivalent of Moody\u2019s or Fitch announced that it was going to place the sub-national debt sector on a negative outlook and downgrade five state government credit ratings. Of the eight states it rated, six were below the threshold for issuing investment-grade bonds.\n\nSome of Nigeria\u2019s richest states are actually its most indebted. They owe the most both in terms of overall dollar amounts and as a percentage of internally generated, non-federally derived revenues, or IGR.\n\nFor example, Data from Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that Delta State which is popularly known for its oil-rich heritage was Nigeria\u2019s third most indebted state as at the end of 2014.\n\nIt owed $233 million to its creditors, roughly five times its annual IGR then. This amount was well beyond the World Bank\u2019s debt burden threshold that stipulated that debt should not exceed 200 percent of IGR.\n\nRead also: Nigeria remains open to investors \u2013 DMO\n\nThat being said, half of all the states in Nigeria have debt-to-revenue ratios that are twice as high as the World Bank sustainability ratio or higher.\n\nJust as there is no easy hack to paying back debts, there are no nice ways to say that the continuously increasing amount spent on debt servicing has debilitating impacts on the economy.\n\nWith 40 percent of Nigerians still living below the poverty line, Nigeria\u2019s revenue projection is beginning to look unattainable and unable to meet the deteriorating situation in the country.\n\nEsther Oye, an economic analyst and a lecturer at Covenant University stated that recent trends indicate that Nigeria is going to be borrowing to the quantum of our budget projections.\n\n\u201cThe direct implication is that any additional money that the government spends would be from additional borrowing; so what it means is that the borrowing will continue to increase.\n\n\u201cIf all our revenue is going to the servicing of debt, it means we have major fiscal problems which could have dire consequences in the near future,\u201d Oye said.\n\nThe Nigerian economy has been and is still operating in \u2018reverse\u2019, Productivity rates are low while debt servicing is increasing (ridiculous). In order to restore balance, two critical realities are non-negotiable; productivity has to increase which in turn would translate to increased revenue. The government needs to begin to invest heavily in production else this ever inflating debt crisis would swallow the economy sooner than later.",

          "title": "Apathy, dysfunctional BVAS, late arrival of officials mark FCT Area Council poll",
          "text": "The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Council election which held Saturday was characterised by low voter turnout, dysfunctional and failed Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) devices as well as late arrival of officials for the commencement of the exercise, despite assurances by the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) that the polls would be better than past ones.\n\nThere are a total of 1.373 million registered voters in the FCT spread across the six Area Councils, 62 Wards, and 2,822 Polling Units in the Territory.\n\nBut BusinessDay observed that less than 50percent of the voters especially in the city center, comprising, Asokoro, Garki, Wuse, Maitama, Wuse 2, Jabi, Gwarinpa turned out to exercise their franchise.\n\nHours after the election finally commenced behind schedule \u2013 due to the late arrival of voting materials and INEC officials- very few or virtually no voters were seen at most of the Polling Units (PUs) especially the newly created ones.\n\nWhen BusinessDay visited the PUs at the PTF Estate in Wuse 2 and Onitsha Crescent in Asokoro, there were no voters, though the poll officials including, security operatives were on the ground.\n\nAlso at PU 005 -Garki Village, New Primary School School II just about 25 voters out of the 2, 983 registered voters were on the queue. Only 38 votes were cast at PU004 -Old Karu palace with a total of 2,850 voters while only one registered voter who identified himself as Maro Damian turned out at the PU 051-FCDA quarters after 12 noon.\n\nAt PU02- Garki by Wine Shop, none of the seven registered voters turned up as at the time BusinessDay visited, just as observed at the newly created PUs 011 and 025 located at Nyanya market and Morning Star Hotel, Nyanya in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC).\n\n\u201cWe have this long-standing issue of non-indigenes not wanting to come out and vote during area council elections,\u201d said a voter who simply identified himself as Ahmed.\n\nThe creation of new PUs also disenfranchised many voters, some of whom were unaware of their new polling units and were turned back by officials.\n\nHabakkuk Ibrahim, a PDP Agent at the polling unit 027, Kuje, said many voters who were unable to \u201clocate their polling units due to poor sensitisation by the electoral body, went home frustrated.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in polling units, 37/02/02/003, Kuduru Ward, Bwari Area Council outside the city center, voting commenced at about 10 am, but barely 30 persons had voted as at 12:40 pm. That PU has a total of 2642 registered voters.\n\nThough, the situation, BusinessDay gathered was better in some outskirts of Karshi in AMAC; Kuje, Gwagwalada, Bwari and Kwali Area Councils.\n\nApart from the low turnout of voters, the election was equally characterised by dysfunctional BVAS that have been deployed for both fingerprint and facial authentications during accreditation.\n\nIn most of the Polling Units monitored, the devices were either not capturing voters\u2019 fingers and faces or were slow, thereby delaying accreditation and voting. The Kuduru PU for instance had only one BVAS machine for hundreds of voters who gathered. BusinessDay keenly observed that it could take up to 5 minutes to capture and verify one person.\n\nAt PU 001, PU 002, and PU 025 in Nyanya Market, the BVAS were not effective, and the same for PU 05-Gwarinpa where the device could only capture 20 voters to cast their ballot. The Unit has about 1837 registered voters. Also, as at the time BusinessDay visited PU 001-Garki Dispensary, only 17 persons had voted out of 1965 registered, while at PU 017-Ugwan-Bawa in Nyanya a good number of voters turned but could not exercise their franchise for the same reason.\n\nIn Kuchiko/old GSS 004 polling unit, the BVAS machine broke down for at least one hour leaving voters stranded, there was also a very poor internet connection. The entire process was very disorderly despite the presence of security operatives. The situation was the same for Zango and Guto polling units, where voters expressed deep concerns that they may not have the opportunity to exercise their franchise.\n\nOne of the voters, Maimuna Hassan, who lamented that she had to abandon her business to participate in the voting, said the poor functioning of the BVAS was quite frustrating and contributed to many abandoning voting.\n\n\u201cWe are tired; many of our women who came here since morning have gone home. I am just staying back because I want my Chairman to win,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the Presiding Officers, mostly members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) who spoke on condition of anonymity, complained that the inefficiency created by the BVAS was very frustrating.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is frustrating. The BVAS are very slow in that it takes more than 10 minutes to accredit one voter. Sometimes, the device will not even capture the fingerprints and faces of the voters. This has made some of them go back. We are thinking of calling the Registration Centre Officials for a solution,\u201d one of the Presiding Officers told BusinessDay.\n\nThe inefficiencies are despite the assurances by INEC that it had reviewed the performance of the BVAS in the recent Anambra State governorship election with a view to improving them for optimal performance in the FCT Polls.\n\nINEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu at the last extended stakeholders meeting ahead of the FCT election on Tuesday said lessons learned from the Anambra election had been considered in planning for the Area Council election.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS have been configured and ready to deploy for the election. We have also made adequate arrangements for technical support and transportation to speedily respond in the unlikely event of glitches,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, there was the late arrival of officials and materials for the election which caused the exercise not to commence, well over one hour after the PUs were supposed to open for accreditation and voting.\n\nIn fact, two hours after the 8:30 am scheduled time for the commencement of the 2022 chairmanship and councillorship elections, voting was yet to commence in the 6 area councils, reason being the non-arrival of INEC officials at the various polling units.\n\nAccreditation and voting were scheduled to start at 8:30 am and close at 2:30 pm but that was not so, as most of the polling units visited by our Correspondent had not opened at the time while the voting continued after the period earmarked.\n\nA visit to most of the centers in Nyanya, Karu, Jikwoyi, Kpeghi, Asokoro, Garki, and Kuduru communities in the Abuja Municipal Area Council, showed no presence of men and materials. In some centers canopies were yet to be erected.\n\nThe story was said to be the same in all the other five Council areas according to our correspondents.\n\nHowever, security agents made up of Police, Civil Defence and Road Safety were seen at the various polling units visited. There was a massive \u201cshow of force\u201d by men of the military and other security agencies around the metropolis ostensibly to ward off criminal elements.\n\nFor instance, at PU 145- Mr. Biggs, Lugbe, the poll officials arrived at 12:45 pm and could not meet a few of the 1,844 registered voters in the unit who had left before their arrival just as the officials also arrived late at 006 -Area C1, 043 -Police Post and 044 -Angwandadi in Nyanya.\n\nA visibly angry party agent, Musbau Ismail told BusinessDay at the Karu Civic center polling unit that he and his colleagues have been waiting for INEC officials since 7 am.\n\n\u201cMy brother as you can see, nothing is happening here. We have been here waiting for them and the materials since 7 am till now 9.05 am,\u201d said.\n\nBusinessDay had earlier reported that the delay was not unconnected with the protests of ad-hoc staff engaged for the exercise over alleged non-payment of their training allowances and replacement by relatives of staff of INEC, Collation, and Returning Officers.\n\nRead also: Abuja area council polls in photos\n\nIt was, however, observed that the polls were generally peaceful as there were no incidents of violence or disruption of the process as at the time of this report except a middle-aged woman allegedly killed by a supporter of one of the political parties who knocked her down with a motorcycle.\n\nThe incident happened close to the PU048 -Salasi, opposite Post Office, Karu in AMAC when the woman, a prospective voter was attempting to cross the road to her polling unit.\n\nThe party supporter whose details are still sketchy was recklessly riding on a motorcycle adorned with the flag of his political party.\n\nThe killer motorcycle rider was immediately apprehended and handed over to security operatives deployed for the election, hence averting the breakdown of law and order.\n\nBusinessDay further noticed an incidence of vote-buying at Jamb headquarters car park unit 10 when a former Senate President of Nigeria, shared some cash to youths which caused chaos and great disorderliness. In polling unit 37/02/02/003, some party agents were giving voters N1,000 and N500 which almost caused commotion.\n\nFurthermore, Covid-19 protocols such as physical distancing and use of face masks were not observed by voters who queued up at most of the PUs visited but the poll officials had hand sanitizers and other protective items provided by INEC.\n\nMore so, restriction of movement was not strictly enforced as usually done at elections due to the conflicting reports from the FCT Command of the Nigeria Police Force; one allowing movement and the other restricting movement.\n\nThe Command had on Thursday announced restriction of movement within the Territory for Saturday, from 12 am to 4 pm, but in a dramatic twist, it canceled the order.\n\nHowever, in a statement issued Friday by Josephine Adeh, the Command Spokesperson, residents were asked to go about their normal duties, which many of the residents claimed they were not aware of.",
          "summary": "There are a total of 1.373 million registered voters in the FCT spread across the six Area Councils, 62 Wards, and 2,822 Polling Units in the Territory.\n\u201cWe have this long-standing issue of non-indigenes not wanting to come out and vote during area council elections,\u201d said a voter who simply identified himself as Ahmed.\nINEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu at the last extended stakeholders meeting ahead of the FCT election on Tuesday said lessons learned from the Anambra election had been considered in planning for the Area Council election.\nA visit to most of the centers in Nyanya, Karu, Jikwoyi, Kpeghi, Asokoro, Garki, and Kuduru communities in the Abuja Municipal Area Council, showed no presence of men and materials.\nHowever, security agents made up of Police, Civil Defence and Road Safety were seen at the various polling units visited.",

The HEART sectors are Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy, and Transportation.\n\nSpeaking at the award ceremony in Lagos on Wednesday, Head, Business Growth and Partnerships with Sterling Bank, Mr. David Adebayo, said the HEART sectors represent the focus and strategy of the bank. According to him, \u201cA critical look at any of the chosen sectors indicates that any action taken to upscale the sectors would have a remarkable impact on the overall economy.\u201d\n\nHe explained that it is because the bank understands it cannot do it alone that a decision was taken to partner with young tech talents in those sectors, that are doing things differently and to help them to scale. The awardees and other participants at the award ceremony were exposed to mentors, including Oluyomi Ojo, Founder, Printivo; Olamide Afolabi, Managing Director, Touch and Pay Technologies Limited; Idowu Akinde, Founder, Boolean Labs, and Seun Abimbola, Co-founder of Rentit, among others.\n\nThe mentors advised the recipients to develop, among other qualities, a positive outlook, be street smart, perseverance and stamina while building fantastic products and relationships as these will increase their odds of achieving amazing outcomes. The recipients were informed that they will have access to fellow Founder Institute Lagos Alumni during the training program, along with exposure to founders from other markets across Africa.\n\nThe mentors advised the awardees to prepare for very rigorous sessions, demonstrating how they could convert their ideas and thoughts into products, adding that they will still need advisors and mentors to guide them on this journey.\n\nDirector, Founder Institute, Lagos Chapter, Wande Adalemo said Founder Institute is the world\u2019s most proven network to turn ideas into fundable startups, and startups into global businesses, adding that the\n\nFounder Institute has helped to launch more than 5,000 companies in more than 200 cities across six continents. He further said FI works by finding great people with great ideas to give devoted support by putting them through a structured growth process and providing them with lifetime support.\n\nAdalemo described FI\u2019s core methodology as a proven process designed to build, rapidly and cost-effectively, through structured and sequential feedback as well as collaborations between founders and the institute\u2019s network of mentors.\n\nThe company was founded in 2009 by serial entrepreneur Adeo Ressi and his colleague, Jonathan Greechan. The idea for the program spawned from operating TheFunded.com, where it became apparent that most entrepreneurs at the idea and launch stages lacked the structure, feedback, and support network needed to succeed. He said FI is presently valued at $25 Billion, with 5,300 alumni, and has raised over $1.5 Billion from investors across the globe. According to him, FI believes there are great entrepreneurs everywhere who can focus, scale, and become part of the global tech system.",

          "text": "By Victor Adeoti\n\nTraditional rulers in Osun have promised to support Gov. Gboyega Oyetola, in his quest for re-election in the July 16 gubernatorial election in the state.\n\nThis is contained in a statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, on Saturday in Osogbo.\n\nOmipidan said that the traditional rulers spoke during \u201cStrategic Engagement Tour\u201d of the governor to Ife-South and Ife-North Federal Constituency.\n\nAccording to the statement, the traditional rulers said that the modest achievements of the governor in the state are enough to convince the electorate to re-elect him for a second term.\n\nSpeaking in his palace, the Olubosin of Ifetedo, Oba Akinola Akinrera, said \u201cthe spirit of his ancestors are solidly behind the governor for victory.\u201d\n\nOba Akinrera said that the modest achievements of the governor, particularly in the areas of health, security, infrastructure and education, are enough to get him re-elected for a second term.\n\nThe traditional ruler appreciated the governor for bringing to life the dilapidated and abandoned Ifetedo General Hospital.\n\nHe said if that was the only thing the governor had done for his subjects, he should be expecting a reciprocative gesture through massive votes.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the traditional rulers in Ife-North State Constituency, the Salu of Edunabon, Oba Kehinde Oladepo, assured the governor of his people\u2019s support.\n\nOba Oladepo said the people of the state have already made up their minds to return the governor with their votes in the July 16 governorship election.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat you have done in the last three years is a sign that you can do better during your second coming, and this is going to manifest in the July governorship election.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring you of delivering Ife-North State Constituency to the ruling party, while we will do everything humanly possible to ensure your victory. Our people will vote overwhelmingly to return you to office to continue the good work that you are doing\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, Gov. Oyetola said his administration is committed to taking the state to an enviable height ever known in history.\n\nOyetola, who said, though the purpose of the tour was to familiarise with the new executives of the ruling party and seek their consent to re-contest, urged the people of the areas to continue to support his administration.\n\nAlso, the APC State Chairman, Mr Gboyega Famodun, implored members of the party to remain steadfast and united in the collective goal to take the party to victory in the forthcoming governorship election.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Gov. Oyetola had, in the last two weeks, embarked on strategic engagement tour to all the Federal Constituencies in the state.\n\nHe had also familiarised with the newly-elected executives of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the grassroots.",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike says President Mohammedu Buhari is afraid that giving assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill will make his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) to fail in the 2023 general election.\n\nGovernor Wike made the assertion at the inauguration of lecture halls, laboratories and offices of the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences of the Bayelsa Medical University in Yenagoa on Saturday, according to a statement signed by his spokesperson Kelvin Ebiri\n\nThe Governor pointed to the inclusion of the compulsory transmission of electoral results electronically in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is now the APC\u2019s greatest fear.\n\nREAD ALSO: Accreditation Challenges Mar FCT Council Elections\n\n\u201cThey are afraid that if INEC in 2023 transmits election results electronically that is the end of them, because they know they will fail,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Wike wondered why the APC controlled Federal Government always seeks excuse to justify their unwillingness to sign into law what will advance the country\u2019s electoral process.\n\nHe explained that in 2019 the president declined assent because the compulsory use of the card reader was included, which was seen as capable of dimming their chance of winning the election.\n\nAgain, Governor Wike noted that the President also recently declined assent on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill on the basis that the National Assembly included direct primaries and that a serving minister have to resign before being qualified to contest for election.\n\n\u201cEvery time this government, this party will find an excuse of not signing an Electoral Act. In 2018 to 2019 when they inserted the card reader in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, Mr President said no, it is too early, I will not sign because they know if they had inserted it (card reader) in 2019 election it would have been difficult for APC to have won,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow, we are in 2022, going for 2023, National Assembly in their wisdom said there must be direct primaries by all the parties, Mr President came and said no, put options. National Assembly in their wisdom has amended the bill and agreed to what Mr President said. Now again, Mr President said I\u2019m in dilemma, I\u2019m consulting. What is the consultation? That there is a clause that says if a minister or a commissioner want to run for election you have to resign, that is why up till now Mr President cannot assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike said these are trivial excuses because in 2015, he resigned as minister, contested and won the governorship of Rivers State. He then wonders the basis of the claim that the president is consulting or that they are in a dilemma.\n\n\u201cAfter all, when I was a minister I resigned to run for governorship. I resigned and I won the primaries. So what is this hulabaloo of not resigning and you keep Nigerians fate hanging. Everyday, Nigerians are thinking, what is going to be the future, where are we heading to?\u201d\n\nThe governor described as regrettable nobody does what is good for the citizenry and the country. He also opined that Nigeria does not have a National Assembly that has what it takes to do the right thing for the good of the country.\n\nGovernor Wike commended the Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri for his development stride as it is characteristic of governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nHe said while those of the APC are full of excuses and justify their lack of commitment to the wellbeing of their respective States, those of the PDP deplore wisdom, and resources to provide infrastructure that improve the life of people in their State.\n\nGovernor Wike donated N500 Million Naira towards the completion of the Faculty of Basic Clinical Sciences building project at the Bayelsa Medical University, which is still at DPC, (damp proof course) level.\n\nHe explained his delight at the courage of Senator Diri in providing such training institution of medical personnel and said that in Niger Delta, there is need for mutual support to be engendered while resisting any attempt to create division among the States.\n\nOn his part, Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri said his administration has built on the vision of his predecessors in expanding the Medical University and increasing the programmes of studies to make it one of the best in the country.\n\nSenator Diri explained that Governor Wike was invited to perform the inauguration because he has already distinguished himself as a lover of medical education and relentlessly provided quality projects in developing.\n\nIn his address, Vice Chancellor of Bayelsa Medical University, Yenagoa, Prof. Ebitimitula Etebu said the Bayelsa Medical University had 8 academic programmes in the faculty of science and basic medical sciences when it was established in 2018.\n\nAccording to him, under the administration of Senator Douye Diri, there are now 18 academic programmes with the student at 200 level of studies.",

          "text": "A judge on Friday ordered protesters at the Ambassador Bridge over the U.S.-Canadian border to end the 5-day-old blockade that has disrupted the flow of goods between the two countries and forced the auto industry on both sides to roll back production.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when or if law enforcement officers would be sent in to remove the demonstrators, who parked their pickups and other vehicles in a bumper-to-bumper protest against the country\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions and an outpouring of fury toward Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government.\n\nChief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz of the Ontario Superior Court said during a virtual hearing that the order would be effective at 7 p.m. to give protesters time to leave.\n\nWindsor police immediately warned that anyone blocking the streets could be subject to arrest and their vehicles may be seized.\n\nThe news was met with defiance by protesters.\n\nAt the Ambassador Bridge, an unidentified person grabbed a microphone and addressed them, asking if they wanted to stay or leave when the deadline rolled around. By a show of applause, it was agreed they would stay. \u201cOK,\u201d\u2019 the man said. \u201cLet\u2019s stand tall.\u201d The protesters responded by singing the Canadian national anthem.\n\nThe crowd later grew in size and intensity, with flag-waving and frequent chants of \u201cFreedom!\u201d More patrol cars moved in around the site, and police handed out leaflets warning that a state of emergency would come into effect at midnight.\n\nSince Monday, drivers mostly in pickup trucks have bottled up the bridge connecting Windsor to Detroit. Hundreds more truckers have paralyzed downtown Ottawa over the past two weeks; it was a party atmosphere there Friday night, when they even set up a concert stage.\n\nAnd protesters have also blocked two other border crossings, in Alberta and Manitoba.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision came after a 4 1/2-hour court hearing at which the city of Windsor and lawyers for auto parts makers argued that the blockade was causing undue economic harm for the city and region.\n\nSupporters of the protesters, some of them truckers, argued that an order to disband would disrupt their right to peacefully protest vaccine mandates that hinder their ability to earn a living.\n\nThe ruling came in a day of fast-moving developments as federal, provincial and local officials worked simultaneously on different fronts to try to break the standoff with the so-called Freedom Convoy, whose members have been cheered on by the right in the U.S., including Fox News personalities, Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cThis unlawful activity has to end and it will end,\u201d Trudeau warned just hours earlier.\n\n\u201cWe heard you. It\u2019s time to go home now,\u201d the prime minister said, cautioning that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d for ending the blockades.\n\nAlso Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency and threatened heavy penalties against those who interfere with the free flow of goods and people.\n\nFord said he would convene the provincial cabinet on Saturday to urgently enact measures that make it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d it is illegal to block critical infrastructure. Violators will face up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of $100,000, he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be consequences for these actions, and they will be severe,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThis is a pivotal, pivotal moment for our nation.\u201d\n\nThe measures will also provide additional authority \u201cto consider taking away the personal and commercial licenses of anyone who doesn\u2019t comply,\u201d according to the premier\u2019s office.\n\nTrudeau called Ontario\u2019s decision \u201cresponsible and necessary\u201d and said he spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden about it.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the American and indeed global influences on the protest,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe talked about the U.S.-based flooding of the 911 phone lines in Ottawa, the presence of U.S. citizens in the blockade and the impact of foreign money to fund this illegal activity.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said that on some fundraising platforms, as much as 50% of the donations are coming from the U.S.\n\nHe said he and Biden agreed that \u201cfor the security of people and the economy, these blockades can\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said he understands the protesters are frustrated by the pandemic, but \u201cthese blockades are hurting everyday families, auto assembly workers, farmers, truckers, blue-collar Canadians.\u201d\n\nThe protests have caused shortages of auto parts that have forced General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Honda to close plants or cancel shifts.",

          "title": "US: In Reversal, FDA Puts Brakes on Covid shots for Kids under 5",
          "text": "COVID-19 vaccinations for children under 5 hit another monthslong delay Friday as U.S. regulators abruptly put the brakes on their efforts to speed review of the shots that Pfizer is testing for youngsters.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, worried about the omicron variant\u2019s toll on kids, had taken the extraordinary step of urging Pfizer to apply for OK of the extra-low dose vaccine before it\u2019s clear if tots will need two shots or three. The agency\u2019s plan could have allowed vaccinations to begin within weeks.\n\nBut Friday, the FDA reversed course and said it had become clear the agency needed to wait for data on how well a third shot works for the youngest age group. Pfizer said in a statement that it expected the data by early April.\n\nFDA\u2019s vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said he hoped parents would understand that the agency\u2019s decision was part of its careful scientific review of the evidence Pfizer has submitted so far.\n\nThat information \u201cmade us realize that we needed to see data from a third dose from the ongoing trial in order to make a determination,\u201d Marks told reporters. \u201cWe take our responsibility for reviewing these vaccines very seriously because we\u2019re parents as well.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s 18 million children under 5 make up the only age group not yet eligible for vaccination.\n\nRachel Perera, the mother of an 8-month-old from Los Angeles, said Friday\u2019s news felt \u201clike the rug just got pulled out from under me.\u201d\n\nAfter consulting with her pediatrician, Perera hoped a vaccine would be available this winter, or in early 2022 at the latest. The education policy researcher and her husband are caring for their child to avoid the unpredictability and risks of child care during a pandemic. But that means working on her dissertation for the Ph. D. she is pursuing when her child sleeps. On top of that, the daily calculations of risks, she says, have left her with \u201cdecision fatigue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just tired, and it feels like \u2018when is this going to end\u2019?\u201d Perera said. \u201cIt feels like people around us are moving on with their lives, and we\u2019re being left behind.\u201d\n\nVaccine experts had been concerned with the sudden race to evaluate Pfizer\u2019s vaccine \u2014 and now wonder what parents will make of the back-and-forth.\n\n\u201cI think they made the right decision to be careful and wait for the third-dose data,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.\n\n\u201cIt was great to hear that there might be some promising data from two doses but it came out as \u2018Hey everybody, you can expect a vaccine in a few weeks,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cI think this messaging gets very confusing for people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first delay. Pfizer originally had expected to know by late December if the extra-low doses worked for kids under 5 \u2014 only to face a disappointing setback. Preliminary study results showed two shots were safe and strong enough to give good protection to babies as young as 6 months. But once tots reached the preschool age \u2014 the 2- to 4-year-olds \u2014 two doses weren\u2019t protective enough, prompting the addition of a third to the study.\n\nSo it was a surprise when a few weeks ago, FDA urged Pfizer and its partner BioNTech to go ahead and apply. Next week, the agency\u2019s independent scientific advisers were set to publicly debate if it was OK to start giving tots two shots before there was proof that a third would give them the extra needed protection \u2014 a highly unusual move.\n\nFriday, the FDA abruptly canceled that meeting, promising to hold it once Pfizer submits the third-dose evidence. Even if Pfizer completes its submission by early April, it will take the FDA and other health authorities several weeks to review and publicly vet the data.\n\nEarlier this week, FDA\u2019s Marks had promised the agency wouldn\u2019t cut corners but also noted how rapidly the pandemic was changing. Before Thanksgiving, no one had heard of omicron, by last month pediatric COVID-19 infections had hit an all-time high \u2014 and now cases are dropping fast as the latest mutant burns out.\n\nHow long to wait for new vaccine data \u2014 and how much to require \u2014 is a difficult balancing act for the FDA. It is caught between pressure to be more proactive against a rapidly changing virus and the risk that acting too quickly may deter families already on the fence about vaccinating their children.\n\nPfizer aims to give children as young as 6 months shots that contain one-tenth of the dose given to adults \u2014 two shots three weeks apart followed by a third at least two months later.\n\nThat\u2019s a smaller dose than youngsters ages 5 to 11 receive, a third of the adult dose.\n\nVaccination rates have been lower among children than in other age groups. As of last week, just 22% of kids ages 5 to 11 and just over half of 12- to 17-year-olds were fully vaccinated, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nearly three-quarters of adults are fully vaccinated.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation poll taken last month found just 3 in 10 parents of children under 5 would get their youngster vaccinated as soon as shots were authorized, while about a quarter said they definitely would not.\n\nDr. Moira Szilagyi, the pediatricians group\u2019s president, recognized parental frustration but said in a statement that doctors were committed to \u201ca careful, robust and transparent process to evaluate the evidence.\u201d\n\nDr. Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Overland Park, Kansas, said, \u201cWe\u2019re just gutted. We need this protection for our kids.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe said some families likely feel relieved \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t want to make that decision without good efficacy data. Other groups of parents are just crying out, \u2018Give us a choice. Show us what you\u2019ve got and let us make a choice. Let us have access to it.\u2019\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "The United States is set to evacuate its embassy in Kyiv as Western intelligence officials warn that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is increasingly imminent.\n\nU.S. officials said the State Department plans to announce early Saturday that virtually all American staff at the Kyiv embassy will be required to leave ahead of a feared Russian invasion.\n\nA small number of officials may remain in Kyiv but the vast majority of the almost 200 Americans at the embassy will be sent out or relocated to Ukraine\u2019s far west, near the Polish border, so the U.S. can retain a diplomatic presence in the country.\n\nThe State Department would not comment.\n\nThe department had earlier ordered families of U.S. embassy staffers in Kyiv to leave. But it had left it to the discretion of nonessential personnel if they wanted to depart. The new move comes as Washington has ratcheted up its warnings about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said a small number of U.S. diplomats may be relocated to Ukraine\u2019s far west, near the border with Poland, a NATO ally, so the U.S. could retain a diplomatic presence in the country.\n\nThe Pentagon announced Friday it is sending another 3,000 combat troops to Poland to join 1,700 who already are assembling there in a demonstration of American commitment to NATO allies worried at the prospect of Russia invading Ukraine.\n\nThe additional soldiers will depart their post at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, over the next couple days and should be in Poland by early next week, according to a defense official, who provided the information under ground rules set by the Pentagon. They are the remaining elements of an infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\nTheir mission will be to train and provide deterrence but not to engage in combat in Ukraine.\n\nThat announcement came shortly after Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser, issued a public warning for all American citizens in Ukraine to leave the country as soon as possible. Sullivan said Russian President Vladimir Putin could give the order to launch an invasion of Ukraine any day now.\n\nIn addition to the U.S. troops deploying to Poland, about 1,000 U.S. soldiers based in Germany are shifting to Romania in a similar mission of reassurance to a NATO ally. Also, 300 soldiers of an 18th Airborne Corps headquarters unit have arrived in Germany, commanded by Lt. Gen. Michael E. Kurilla.\n\nThe American troops are to train with host-nation forces but not enter Ukraine for any purpose.\n\nThe U.S. already has about 80,000 troops throughout Europe at permanent stations and on rotational deployments.",
