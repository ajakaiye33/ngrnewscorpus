Several other telecom consumers also thronged the NCC\u2019s Stand where representatives of various mobile networks, namely MTN, Glo, Airtel and 9mobile were on hand to resolve all complaints referred to them by the Commission\u2019s officials at the pavilion.\n\nAside from having their complaints resolved, the NCC officials also shared Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials on various topical telecom issues to consumers both at the NCC Pavilion and, more importantly, at the \u2018NCC Day\u2019 event which held later in the afternoon of December 6, 2021.\n\nAddressing a large gathering of telecoms consumers at the NCC Day event, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, thanked the Kano Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KACCIMA), organisers of the fair, for the constant invitation to NCC to leverage the trade fair platform as an avenue for engaging telecom stakeholders, especially the consumers.\n\nDanbatta, who was represented by the NCC\u2019s Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, spoke on the theme of the trade fair: \u2018Consolidating the Challenges of Covid-19 Pandemic to Opportunities for Growth and Development of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria,\u201d and promised that the Commission will continue to stimulate the increased access to digital infrastructure to support businesses and individuals, as well as constantly protect consumer rights and privileges.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, the telecommunications sector has been a major driver of the digital economy agenda of the Federal Government, as it continues to provide the needed digital sinews that support the economy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant restriction period.\n\n\u201cSince the outbreak of the pandemic, government institutions, businesses and individuals have relied heavily on telecoms services to carry out their daily operations and official routines. In response to the increased demand for telecoms services, the Commission put a number of regulatory measures in place to ensure seamless access by Nigerians to telecommunications services and protect them against any adverse impact on the quality of service enjoyed by consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said as the Commission continues to drive the remarkable digital transformation being witnessed in the Nigerian economy, one area that the Commission pays greater priority to is how consumers are treated by the service providers. \u201cThis is why at NCC, we continue to treat consumers as Kings and Queens. Of course, that is who they are because, without the consumer, both the regulator and the service providers have no business being in business,\u201d he said.\n\nDanbatta reiterated NCC\u2019s commitment to protecting and empowering consumers \u2013 whether individuals and corporate consumers \u2013 from unfair practices willingly or unwillingly orchestrated by the service providers. \u201cThis is based on our regulatory mandate of ensuring that consumers of telecommunications services deserve to get value for their money, and to be treated right as very important stakeholders in the scheme of things,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the same vein, the NCC\u2019s Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau, Efosa Idehen, in his address, took a great deal of time enlightening the consumers on various consumer-centric initiatives put in place by the Commission to protect consumer rights. The initiatives explained in great detail include the NCC\u2019s various channels of lodging complaints, the NCC toll-free Number 622, the Do-Not-Disturb (DND) shortcode 2442, the NCC\u2019s Emergency Number 112, among several other consumer-focused programmes.\n\nIn his remarks, KACCIMA President, Dalhatu Abubakar, applauded NCC for prioritising consumer protection in all that it does. \u201cI commend you for your efforts in ensuring that telecoms continue to play a critical role in not only transforming the way people live, work and play but also contribute significantly to the growth of Nigerian economy, as evidenced in the sector\u2019s impressive contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),\u201d he said.\n\nTelecom consumers, who won various prizes in a raffle conducted to excite them at the event, also expressed appreciation to the Commission for being one of the leading public institutions championing the interest of the consumers.\n\nNIN will ensure credible citizen-database \u2013 NCC",

The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. The state has continued to use the structures till date.\u201d",

So, we assigned a chalet to him at the Government House.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI attended the ceremony as a mark of honour to him. I thought I should encourage him to link up with us in Osun.\n\n\u201cI was encouraging him but did not know how to say it. First, his background was not Osun.\n\n\u201cSecond, a Commissioner for Works in Lagos controls a far bigger budget than the Governor of Osun State.\n\n\u201cBeing a native of our state, he could be thinking of doing something different in future.\n\n\u201cSo, I started introducing him to people and encouraging him to be part of us. That was how we linked up with Rauf Aregbesola,\u201d Akande recalled.\n\nWhen Omisore was impeached, he discussed with Tinubu about having Aregbesola as his deputy.\n\n\u201cHe promised to get back to me. We didn\u2019t see often and the phone was not efficient in those days.\n\n\u201cTinubu had something doing in Seattle, in the western coast of the United States where he was to be honoured by his old American school. He invited me.\n\n\u201cThe second or third day, Rauf appeared in my hotel room. He said Tinubu said I wanted to talk to him. I asked him to take a seat.\n\n\u201cI offered him the post of deputy governor which would be confirmed by the House of Assembly. Afterwards, I would be able to ease myself out.\n\n\u201cHe thanked me and said he would come back to me. Instead of him, it was Tinubu who came.\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018That boy is shy and he didn\u2019t know how to put it.\u2019 Tinubu explained that Rauf was holding an important position for him in Alimosho local government politics and that he would still need him for mobilisation leading to the 2003 general elections.\n\n\u201cHe apologised that it would not be possible for him to release Rauf. He said I should look for someone else and after my second term, we would think of the next step,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe added that Tinubu said after the election, Aregbesola would come to learn more about Osun and its politics.\n\n\u201cSo, he chose Sooko Adewoyin, an elderly and experienced person from Ile Ife who was introduced to him by Prince Peter Ogunleye as his deputy.\n\n\u201cAt the appointed time, Rauf indeed came to Osun and he proved equal to the task, becoming the first Governor of Osun State to spend full two terms,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has warned former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, not to set Nigeria on fire with his \u201cdirty politicking.\u201d\n\nIt also boasted that Nigeria is safer than it was in 2015 before the All Progressives Congress (APC) took over power from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nGovernment, through the Minister of Information reiterated that President Muhammadu Buhari has done better than his predecessors in tackling insecurity and insurgency in the North East, amidst difficult economic and social conditions.\n\nOn Monday, Obasanjo, at a retreat on inclusive security in Abuja, organised by the Global Peace Foundation and Vision Africa, said: \u201cPresident Buhari has done his best. If we are expecting anything more than what he has done or what he is doing, that means we are whipping a dead horse and there is no need\u2026\u201d\n\nHe added that military action alone cannot end insurgency.\n\nIn its reaction, yesterday, government slammed Obasanjo for disseminating \u201cuntruths and fallacious\u201d statements about Buhari\u2019s leadership.\n\nMohammed, said: \u201cThe polity has recently been awash with heightened commentary on the security situation in the country. The commentary has been triggered by genuine concerns in some circles, and crass politicking or sheer absurdity in others.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari has continued to make the issue of security a major plank of his administration\u2019s policy. This is not a surprise, considering the fact that the fight against insecurity is one of the three priority areas of the APC-led Federal Government.\n\n\u201cYes, the security situation has continued to pose a great challenge, but amidst the cacophony of voices \u2013 some genuinely concerned about the situation and others ready to exploit it for selfish ends \u2013 it is easy to forget where we are coming from.\n\n\u201cToday, we only look at the current situation without wondering what would have been had this president not taken the bull by the horns, as far as security is concerned. With the way insurgents were going before this administration came into office, with their control of a vast swath of land the size of Belgium, with their freewheeling attacks in almost a dozen states, including the Federal Capital Territory, which was hit at least five times, perhaps they could have achieved their aim of declaring an Islamic State in Nigeria, if President Buhari had not acted decisively. After all, in 2014, Boko Haram declared a Caliphate in Gwoza after capturing Bama and Gamboru as well as other towns and villages in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. They installed their own Emirs, collected taxes and flew their flag before the military dislodged them.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that, although banditry and kidnapping had fuelled insecurity across the country, the president has continued to provide \u201cquality leadership in order to ensure that our security agencies decisively tackle the cankerworm of insecurity of any hue. No administration in Nigeria\u2019s recent history has provided the security agencies with the hardware needed to tackle insecurity as that of President Buhari, in addition to raising the morale of our security men and women.\n\n\u201cOnly last week, Mr. President commissioned an armada of naval boats and ships in the latest effort to enhance our nation\u2019s maritime security.The army, the air force and the police, among others, have also been receiving modern hardware to strengthen their arsenal\u2026Despite all these, President Buhari has not relented, constantly presiding over meetings of security chiefs to get an update and also issue necessary directives, and not missing any opportunity to offer succour to his countrymen and women, when necessary.\n\n\u201cThe skewed narrative in certain quarters that the president has not shown enough empathy is glib talk. The president has also continued to work with our neighbouring countries and indeed our Western partners to tackle insecurity, especially terrorism. With the entire Sahelian region experiencing a devastating surge in terrorist attacks, more so in the wake of the Libyan crisis, it has become even more imperative for Nigeria to step up regional cooperation to more effectively tackle insecurity \u2013 and that is what Mr. President has been doing.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has done so much, under very difficult economic and social conditions, to tackle insecurity in our country. Not only has he done so much. President Buhari continues to do much more to keep Nigerians safe. To say he has nothing more to offer is untrue, fallacious and smacks of dirty politicking. By boosting the number and capacity of our fighting forces, Mr. President is putting them in good stead to tackle insecurity not just during the life of his administration but long after he would have left office. President Buhari is leaving a legacy of security, infrastructural development, economic prosperity and social cohesion for Nigeria. This may not seem obvious today, amidst daunting challenges, but posterity will be kind to this President\u2026\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .",

Umar of the High Court of Kebbi State and Justice Edem Kooffreh of the High Court of Cross River State.\n\nA statement from the NJC\u2019s Director of Information, Mr Soji Oye, noted that although there was no written petition, allegations of corruption or impropriety against the subject Judges, council nevertheless, initiated investigation pursuant to its inherent disciplinary powers under the constitution to unravel the circumstances that led to the spate of exparte orders granted by these courts of coordinate jurisdiction over matters bearing same parties and subject matter.\n\n\u201cThe meeting, which was chaired by the Deputy Chairman of Council, Justice Mary Peter-Odili, agreed with the recommendations of the Investigation Committee set up in September 2021, that Justice Okogbule Gbasam of the High Court of Rivers State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever he is due, as he failed to exercise due diligence in granting the Exparte Order in Suit No: PHC/2183/CS/2021 between IBEALWUCHI EARNEST ALEX & 4 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & ANOR, as there was no real urgency, in the circumstances of the matter, that would have required an Exparte Order.\n\n\u201cHis Lordship is also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\n\u201cCouncil also resolved that Justice Nusirat I. Umar of the High Court of Kebbi State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever due, having found fundamental defects and non-compliance with the law in granting the Exparte Order in Suit No: KB/HC/M.71/2021 between YAHAYA USMAN & 2 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & ANOR.\n\nHe is also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\n\u201cJustice Edem Kooffreh of the High Court of Cross River State will not be promoted to higher Bench for five years for allowing himself to be used as a tool for \u2018forum shopping\u2019 and abuse of Court process in Suit No: HC/240/2021 between Mr. ENANG KANUM WANI AND UCHE SECONDUS as it was evident that, in granting the Exparte Order, he was seized of earlier Orders of the High Courts of Rivers and Kebbi States, being Courts of coordinate jurisdiction with his.\n\n\u201cHe is also to receive warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\nThe Council also placed him on its Watch-List for a period of two years,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nIn a related development, the council also approved the appointment of 63 judges for 16 states, nine of which are heads of court.\n\nEighty-four members of staff, ranging from salary Grade levels 7 to 17, were approved for promotion as submitted by its Appointment, Promotion and Disciplinary Committee.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says building financed with bank loan, sale of personal property\n\nChallenges Akande to declare sources of financing own property\n\nAsks Tinubu to state where he got funds to bankroll Buhari, South west APC elections\n\nAfenifere Leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has debunked claims made by former Osun State Govcernor and All Progressives Congress pioneer Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande, that former Lagos Governor Bola Tinubu built his Lekki house for him.\n\nAkande had in his book titled \u2018My Participation\u2019 launched last Thursday, claimed that Adebanjo brought pressure on Tinubu to build the Lekki home for him.\n\n\u201cI therefore deny categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of 3 developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my late leader Chief Obafemi Awolowo of blessed memory,\u201d Adebanjo said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe Afenifere leader said since Tinubu himself was present at the book presentation, he had expected him to, within a few days, refute \u201csuch a malicious falsehood about me emanating from his Man Friday.\u201d\n\nHe premised his expectation on the fact that \u201cTinubu (had said) just some 3 years ago on the occasion of the presentation of my auto-biography \u2018SAYING IT AS IT IS\u2019 that for my incorruptibility and strength of character he Bola Tinubu would not have been Governor of Lagos State in 1999.\u201d\n\nGoing down memory lane, Adebanjo gave details of how he financed the Lekki house. Adebanjo\u2019s statement read:\n\n\u201cThe details are as follows:\n\n\u201cA 4 bedroom duplex with 2 bedroom flat enclosed with 2 undeveloped plots at plot 4, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos State, this is where I was living before moving to Lekki*.\n\n\u201cThe house was commissioned in 1972 by Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u201cspecial branch\u201d headed then by the late Alhaji M.D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when General Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State.\n\n\u201cIt was later occupied by one of the wives Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visit his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house, I took the Federal Government to court for damages and I was awarded #1million naira which has not been paid till today by the Federal Government, Mr. Olisa Agbakoba SAN, was my counsel.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to St Baths Anglican Church, Aguda, Surulere.\n\nTwo storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos State.\n\n\u201cI bought it through an Estate Agent by name Mr. Shiwoniku who has relocated to UK, he has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo.\n\n\u201cHe is still alive and he lives in one of the flats in the building. Four storey building with a warehouse on the ground floor and six flats on top. It was commissioned by Chief Awolowo in 1977.\n\n\u201cI inherited the plot of 45\u2019X100\u2019 from my mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it*.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa. Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by installment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976. Akanbi Onitiri is the father of Sumbo Onitiri, a well known estate surveyor in Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe building was sold to a woman through an estate agent.\n\n\u201cI then took a loan from GTBank to complete the house in Lekki where I am living now*.\n\n\u201cWhen the interest on the loan became unbearable, I was compelled to sell the undeveloped land given to me by Chief Awolowo in Dide-Olu Estate in Maroko Victoria Island. One Mr. Ade Otusanya a friend of my son Femi Ayo-Adebanjo bought the land.\n\n\u201cThe contractor who built my Lekki house is Engr. Hakeem Sulaiman, Senior Partner of Messrs HA associates.\n\n\u201cThe Electrical and Mechanical Contractor is Engr. Tokunbo Oshokoya, Senior Partner of Messrs Oshea Projects.\n\n\u201cThe Architect is Mr. Deji Johnson\n\nThe Quantity Surveyor is the late Otunba T.B Adebayo.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo said \u201cthe Lekki property, the house in my village, Isanya Ogbo, and 3 Bedroom flat in a town house, at Omorinre Street in Lekki are the properties I have in the whole world.\u201d\n\nHe therefore authorized the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to verify the facts he provided.\n\nChallenging Chief Akande to clear the air by disclosing the source of financing his own properties as he had done, Adebanjo claimed: \u201cIt is alleged that Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s building at Ila-Orogun, which I understand is more than double in expanse of my house in Lekki and some other properties he has in Lagos and abroad were financed by Bola Tinubu. His house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Oshogbo, when he was the Governor of Osun State.\u201d\n\nHe also challenged Tinubu to disclose \u201cthe source of his wealth with which he bankrolled the elections of APC in the Southwest and that of General Muhammad Buhari and his various properties in Lagos.\u201d\n\nHe dared the former Lagos governor \u201cto authorize the EFCC to verify such details as I have done above.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi, disclosed this in Abuja while speaking to newsmen at the end of the weekly virtual FEC meeting at the State House, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nDingyadi said the increments would take effect from January 2022.\n\nOther packages announced by the federal government included tax waiver for junior officers with effect from October 2021 and payment of outstanding funds for uninsured personnel between 2013 and 2020.\n\nDingyadi said FEC also approved a review and upgrading of the take home pay of police personnel in Nigeria.\n\nThe pay rise came amid awful revelations and controversies in the wake of the reports and recommendations of the #EndSARS panels set up by state governments to probe the protests, which rocked the country last year.\n\nDingyadi recalled that in October 2020, Nigeria was rocked by #EndSARS protests and Mr. President addressed the country and appealed for calm. He said the president also promised a review of the remunerations of police officers to enhance their take home pay in recognition of the services they rendered to the country in terms of maintenance of peace and order.\n\nThe minister explained, \u201cWe have tried to create a situation where their take home pay will be enhanced through the increase in their allowances.\u201d\n\nDingyadi listed the police personnel allowances and approvals that were reviewed upward to include duty tour allowance, which was raised to six per cent of the new take home pay. Council also approved the payment of N1.12 billion for the settlement of outstanding benefits of personnel for the uninsured period between 2013 and 2020, which had not been covered under the group personal insurance programme.\n\nHe stated, \u201cFEC has also approved the release of N13, 127, 972, 260 (Thirteen billion, one hundred twenty seven million, nine hundred seventy two thousand, two hundred and sixty nine naira) for payment as outstanding death benefits of 5,472 personnel within the uninsured period of 2013 to August 2021, not covered under the Group Life Insurance.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also approved the payment of the sum of 1.2 billion as payment of outstanding burial expenses of personnel period of January 2012 to 2021.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also graciously approved the annual insurance premiums of 750 million naira as well as payment of Four billion, eight hundred and twelve million, five hundred thousand naira for the repairs and replacement of damaged police infrastructure in future budgets, starting from 2022.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also approved a tax waiver in the sum of eighteen billion, six hundred million for personnel, junior officers in the police, in order to increase their take home pay, this is going to take effect from October 2021.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, government has also approved the increase of the current rent subsidy, which is currently between 15 and 20 per cent, amounting to N61 billion, increase is 40 per cent of the consolidated policy salary structure (CONPOST) in the sum of seventy eight billion three hundred million naira, that is to say an increase of about sixteen billion, four hundred million naira. \u201cIt has also approved payment of an additional six per cent shift duty allowance for officers on level 01 to 14 and the supervisors allowances for officers on level 15 and above. This will come out to about ten billion and thirty million naira with effect from 2022. Most importantly, government also approved payment of about 20 per cent of CONPOST, it is peculiar allowances to boost morale, and take home pay of the Nigeria Police.\n\n\u201cThis 20 per cent is percentage of the total salary, known as peculiar allowance. It is a new allowance created to improve their take home pay.\u201d\n\nDingyadi added that all the proposed allowances and salary structure would be compiled and forwarded to the office of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) and Salary and Wages Commission for vetting and proper scrutiny\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is thereafter that the Accountant General of the Federation will be directed to approve the payment. We can see that with this development now, the police would be earning a more attractive pay that will be commensurate with what they\u2019re doing. What we expect the police to do after this is to double their efforts and justify the confidence that Mr. President and FEC have vested in them.\n\n\u201cAs a ministry we will do whatever it takes to ensure that we improve the performance and the relationship between the police and the public to ensure that they justify this good gesture.\u201d\n\nThe minister emphasised that although the proposal may not have been captured in the 2022 Appropriation Bill, it would be taken care of via a supplementary budget that would be sent later to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who was also at the media briefing, said the police wage increase was not part of the 2022 budget proposal of federal government currently before the National Assembly. Ahmed assured that the police salary increase would come into effect once the supplementary budget was approved by the legislative arm.\n\n\u201cNo, we are not talking about taking effect in January 2022. But the effective date is still January 2022. When all the problems are sorted out there will be supplementary budget sent to the parliament.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Electoral Bill: Three Days to Go, Buhari Keeps Nigerians in Suspense",
          "text": "\u2022President plays card close to his chest, as ex-lawmaker expresses optimism\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos\n\nDespite appeals from different quarters to President Muhammadu Buhari, including the diplomatic community, to sign the amended electoral bill forwarded to him by the National Assembly on November 19, the president has continued to keep the people in suspense even when it is three days to the 30 days deadline within which he is constitutionally mandated to assent to the bill or return same to the legislature.\n\nAlthough the president has not hinted at any possibility since he received the electoral bill, the bill has, however, been mired in controversy between those urging Buhari to sign it in order to enhance participatory democracy as indicated through the approval of direct primaries and those who have reservations about that model of electing candidates by political parties.\n\nHowever, while a political party, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), has accused the president of failing to assent, a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Timothy Golu, has expressed optimism that Buhari would sign the bill eventually.\n\nRecently, some newspapers\u2019 reports had alleged that the president might have caved in to pressure from some governors of his party, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and withheld his assent to the bill, because of the excuse that direct primaries would be too expensive to run.\n\nBut the presidency and the National Assembly had quickly come out to dismiss it as untrue. While one of Buhari\u2019s spokespersons, Mallam Garba Shehu, said he had not been briefed about such a development and therefore not correct, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, too said it was untrue.\n\nInterestingly, those believed to be pushing for indirect primaries were said to have recently reactivated their agenda, seeing that the president had a few days more to the deadline.\n\nAccording to sources, they have reached an understanding with a section of the National Assembly leadership that they would convince the president to return the bill to them on the grounds that he wanted certain clauses amended, but that once that was done, they should file it away and not treat it till the time of the elections.\n\nAlthough the president, sources claimed, was being convinced to inform the principal officers of the National Assembly that he would withhold his assent for them to also reconsider the timing for the submission of candidates\u2019 list by political parties from 180 days to 90 days as it currently stipulated in the 2010 amended electoral act, it is a decoy to scuttle the whole process.\n\nYet, those who want the president to leave a legacy of sound and enduring electoral system, have insisted that even if he would return the bill on the grounds of a few contentious clauses, including direct primaries, he must ensure that the current effort at reforming the electoral system through many other clauses did not go to waste.\n\nCuriously, however, those in support of the president assenting to the bill as it were and also convinced he would sign it eventually, have argued that the process of returning a bill to the legislature was much longer than merely signing it hence their conviction that the president had only kept the decision to himself.\n\nAccording to a THISDAY news analysis published yesterday, which quoted a presidency source, \u201cYou also need to understand the process, because there is a process or if you like, protocol to these things. Remember that immediately the bill was forwarded to the president by the National Assembly, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, wrote to the president and advised against it.\n\n\u201cIt was after this that the governors took up the campaign and asked for the aspect of direct primaries to be yanked off, citing many reasons that could not fly in the face of logic. But if the president was going to listen to his AGF or give in to the pressure by the governors, the process is that he would have instructed the AGF to draft a letter of response back to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThus, if a process like that has been triggered, then you would have known that the president was not going to sign it, following the same channel of communication and as advised by his AGF. But since it was sent to him, the president has just kept quiet and knowing that signing is just about a small ceremony and solely the call of the president, so, he could choose to delay it and just sign whenever he wants for as long as it is before the deadline,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source, which cited the fact that the National Assembly would proceed on recess today, Thursday, December 16th, further contended that, \u201cIf there was going to be any communication rejecting the bill, he would have triggered the process before they embark on their recess, of which they wouldn\u2019t be back until later in January, and by which time, the process for the Ekiti and Osun States governorship elections would have begun.\n\n\u201cI mean, it belies logic that the president would write to the National Assembly after they had proceeded on recess. Therefore, if he is not writing them between now and Thursday, when they would go on recess, then, it is a deal. He will sign it, since the signing ceremony is his personal business,\u201d the source explained.\n\nBesides, the source, which equally quoted the president at a recent virtual Summit for Democracy organised by the United States President, Joe Biden, where he reiterated his commitment to leaving behind a lasting legacy of credible polls for the nation\u2019s democratic development, added that Buhari was mindful of his commitment to the diplomatic community.\n\n\u201cAs we countdown to our next general election in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government, but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner,\u201d Buhari stated at the summit.\n\nMeanwhile, a political party, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), has accused the president of failing to reciprocate the usual cordial relationship between the Executive and the present National Assembly by his refusal to assent the Electoral Act amendment bill sent to him.\n\nNational Chairman of the party, Senator Saidu Dansadau, who spoke at the end of the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Tuesday in Abuja, said the executive was not fair to the National Assembly by President Buhari\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cIf there is any president since 1999 that enjoyed maximum cooperation, it is President Muhammadu Buhari and for National Assembly to respond to the yearnings of majority of Nigerians and passed the bill as requested for by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAnd we saw on national televisions that APC governors met and said they are against the bill that would ensure free and transparent elections in the country. And they went and lobbied Mr. President to hold his assent by returning it to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cTo me, he (Buhari) is unfair to the National Assembly. He has not reciprocated their gesture as they have done to him since the past six and a half years. Also, he has not been fair to Nigerians, who voted him into power, because majority of Nigerians are interested in the passage of this bill and this is unacceptable to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI appealed to Mr. President to, in the name of God, assent to that bill without any doctoring and I also appeal to members of the National Assembly to resist any attempt by the president to tinker with what they have done,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Golu, while calling on the National Assembly to encourage Nigerians and assure them that the bill would be signed eventually, said the president has been in touch with various people from the villa regarding the bill.\n\nGolu, who spoke yesterday on the Morning Show of ARISE NEWS Television, said he believed that the National Assembly would stand its ground as they were not doing it for the president or the party but in the interest of democracy.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, you can see the level of joy and excitement. Everybody is watching and listening to what is happening everyday in regards to the the electoral reforms. There is no reason for him not to sign it. We are waiting patiently, because it\u2019s going to be a legacy as this has encouraged a lot of people to start registering in political parties.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians don\u2019t belong to any political party, because they don\u2019t participate in raising or nominating flag bearers. They only participate at the general election, where flag bearers or ticket holders are imposed on them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn direct primaries, he explained that it was dependent on whether the nation was operating a delegate system or direct primary system.\n\n\u201cWhoever is putting pressure on the president wants to achieve some personal gains but when you look at the bigger picture, I believe that four or three days should not be a problem, because he has signed bills towards the end of the minimum time frame before, so whatever happens, members of the public are there to hold their representatives accountable in case the president decides other wise, which is very unlikely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president will be ready to be embarrassed by the National Assembly at that level. The question is: did you win your elections the way it should have been won? Those who do not want it know, those who didn\u2019t want it know what they did to get to the National Assembly,\u201d Golu further stated.\n\nWhile calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) witness primary elections as provided by the current provision of the electoral act, noted that political parties contributed to maintaining these things as it was going to be a systematic process with due accreditation.\n\n\u201cI urge them not to allow partisan and I want to believe that in their own conscience, the National Assembly will not toy with what the nation has been looking up to. Nobody should be above the electoral act and constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled his visit to Abeokuta, Ogun State earlier scheduled for next week.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that the President was expected to depart Abuja next Tuesday for Abeokuta.\n\nFile photo used to illustrate story.\n\nThe Ogun State Government also confirmed the planned visit in a short statement on Thursday.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Junketing President Buhari Plans Local Trip To Ogun After Return From Turkey\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR will be visiting Ogun State for the commissioning of some of the legacy projects of our dear Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, MFR.\n\n\u201cThe visit is scheduled for 21st of December, 2021.\n\n\u201cSome of the projects include; the Gateway City Gate, GCG; Sagamu Interchange-Siun-Abeokuta Road; Kobape Housing Estate; King's Court Estate; and Ijebu Ode-Mojoda-Epe Road. It promises to be a fun-filled and fulfilling official visit,\u201d the statement read.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, a presidential source disclosed that the visit to the South-West state has been cancelled.\n\nAccording to the source, Buhari fell sick on his way to Turkey.\n\nHe added that an advanced team of the President had been asked not to leave Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe planned trip to Ogun State has been cancelled. The President is not feeling well, he is still on his way to Turkey. They just left Reggio Calabria in Italy,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, the Presidency has come up with a lie as an excuse for jettisoning the trip to Ogun next week.\n\n\"Their excuse is that the host is not ready; that is their excuse for shunning the trip,\" the source said.\n\nThe Nigerian President has been junketing across the world in the last three months.\n\nSaharaReporters had on December 1 reported how Buhari departed the country to attend the Expo 2020 in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\nShortly after hosting and meeting South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, Buhari left the nation's capital, Abuja, for the UAE.\n\nIn September 2021, Buhari travelled to New York, United States, to participate in the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\n\nOn October 3, he visited Ethiopia to attend the inauguration of the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, for a second five-year term in office.\n\n\n\nHe was in Saudi Arabia on October 24 for an investment conference organised by the Future Investment Initiative Institute and lesser Hajj in Madinah and Makkah.\n\n\n\nTwo days after returning to Nigeria from Saudi Arabia, Buhari left the country for Glasgow, Scotland, to participate in the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\n\n\nThe President, however, on November 2 secretly abandoned the conference and travelled to London for a medical checkup.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Buhari Seeing Doctors In London, To Visit South Africa Next Week\n\n\n\nHis aircraft, a Gulfstream Aerospace GV-SP (G550) with registration number 5N-FGW and serial number 5310 (Mode-S 0640F2), left the Glasgow International Airport at 10:14 pm (9:14 UK time) and arrived at Stansted Airport, London at 11:11 pm (10:11 pm UK time).\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, November 9, Buhari departed London for Paris, France.\n\n\n\nOn November 13, it was also reported that Buhari in endless junketing was pictured leaving the French capital with some of his aides and making his way to the 5N-FGW (Gulfstream Aerospace) aircraft.\n\n\n\nThe 5N-FGW (Gulfstream Aerospace) was registered as Nigerian Air Force 1, to replace the Boeing Business Jet (Boeing 737-700) 5N-FGT that is still in Germany for repairs.",

          "text": "Olagunsoye Oyinlola, a former governor of Osun, says one of the appointees of Bisi Akande, his predecessor, confessed that state funds were used for the latter\u2019s 2003 governorship election campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkande was the governor of Osun between 1999 and 2003 on the platform of the defunct Alliance for Democracy (AD).\n\nHe, however, lost the 2003 governorship election to Oyinlola, who contested on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nSpeaking about events that occurred after his tenure, Akande, in his new book titled \u2018My Participations\u2019, said his successor accused him of mismanaging state funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Osun governor said Oyinlola arrested two of his commissioners, adding that the arrested appointees were told by the police to implicate him in their statements.\n\n\u201cThat was what ended the case of my alleged stealing in Osun State. No one ever wrote any petition against me to the EFCC, ICPC or the police for any fraud or wrongdoing during my term of office,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\n\u201cIt was Oyinlola that was exhuming fake complaints and evidence from files merely to witch-hunt me. I never gave or demanded bribe from anyone all my life. All of us who served in my government, all my commissioners and others, came out the way we went in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo one was richer and not a single one of my political appointees was indicted after we left office despite that an opposition party came to power after us.\u201d\n\nReacting to Akande\u2019s claim, Oyinlola, in a statement on Thursday, said he did not level any false charges against his predecessor.\n\n\u201cChief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House). I did not level any false charges against him,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cI came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election was really not completed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to site and complete the works, more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\n\n\u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s own appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant.

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds.\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google.\nThis happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Startup Bill (NSB) is a step closer to getting enacted into law as it has now been approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC). The approval was made on December 15, and now, the Presidency will submit the bill to the National Assembly for consideration.\n\nThe NSB aims to create an enabling environment for Nigerian startups to thrive.The three major challenges that the bill is looking to tackle are the lack of an enabling environment, unclear regulatory framework, and inadequate local content support. The bill proposes measures to ensure that these issues are addressed. For example, there will be protection and incentives, like tax breaks and access to an exclusive list of public and private-led funding opportunities, for local entrepreneurs. There will also be incentives to attract local and foreign investors to the Nigerian startup community.\n\nAlthough Nigeria has the highest number of startups on the continent\u2014about 750\u2014and holds the total highest YoY raises, it ranks below countries like South Africa, Kenya, and Tunisia in terms of business friendliness. With bans on cryptocurrency trading, and clampdowns on online investment, trading, and even social media, Nigeria\u2019s startup scene has been rocked by a few disruptive regulatory announcements in recent years.\n\nThe bill is the result of a collaborative effort between the Presidency, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, the Nigerian Export and Promotion Council and wider government bodies. The initiative was launched in May of this year by the Presidency, in collaboration with 30 tech leaders, including Ventures Platform founder Kola Aina and Future Africa founder Iyin Aboyeji, officials of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and the Minister of Digital Economy Isa Pantami. Since then, it has garnered almost 300 volunteers, with private sector players participating, including legal firms like TLP Advisory and Aelex, policy advisors Advocacy for Policy and Innovation (API) and Innovation for Policy Foundation, and media organisations TechCabal and Wimbart. Google Nigeria and the UK overnment, through the West Africa Research and Innovation Hub and the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub, are also backing the bill.\n\nSpeaking on recent developments, Oswald Osaretin Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Digital Transformation and the NSB Lead said, \u201cThe NSB is one among a series of key activities the Presidency is using to drive the building of a more sustainable ecosystem for young people in Nigeria to thrive and scale.\u201d\n\nKola Aina, Founder and General Partner of Ventures Platform Fund, also added, \u201cThe bill is being proposed to provide an enabling environment for the growth of startups and guard against different challenges faced by startups such as seemingly disruptive regulations, lack of regulatory certainty, and weak infrastructure like broadband, open data, and digital platforms that limit the optimisation of the many benefits of the digital economy.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nAuthor Mu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 I bully myself because I make me do what I put my mind to.

From someone buying a $2.5 million land to another paying $450,000 to be Snoop Dogg\u2019s virtual neighbour, it appears to be a valuable investment.\n\nWhat makes them valuable? Why so much money is being spent on \u2018real\u2019 estate that cannot be lived in is a mystery. But some people believe it\u2019s the future and what better time to invest than now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, investing in the metaverse isn\u2019t free. If you\u2019re looking to invest through real estate, the cheapest parcel of land on Decentraland \u2014 a blockchain-based virtual universe \u2014 is 3ETH ($12,000).\n\nNestcoin is offering Africans an entry point into the metaverse through gaming.

Barely a week after uLesson\u2019s $15 million Series B, Nigeria\u2019s Edukoya is announcing its $3.5 million pre-seed.\n\nThe round was led by Target Global, with participation from an exciting lineup of angel investors, including Paystack Co-founder, Shola Akinlade and Kuda Bank Co-founders Babs Ogundeyi and Musty Mustapha.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Edukoya launched in December 2021 and is currently in beta with plans to go live fully in 2022.\n\nInteresting! Yes, it\u2019s pretty jaw-dropping, but the startup\u2019s founder, Honey Ogundeyi, isn\u2019t a newbie in the tech space. She was the former Country Director for UK-Nigeria Tech-Hub, Kuda\u2019s founding CMO and Founder of online fashion marketplace, Fashpa.\n\nCommenting on the funding, Ogundeyi said the startup\u2019s vision is to redefine online education and democratise access to high-quality content, making it available to all students across the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEdtech is growing, but there\u2019s quite a bit that needs to be done. Online education needs the Internet, smartphones and computers to thrive. However, Africa\u2019s Internet penetration rate is still at 39%, lower than the global average of 58%.\n\nIn the words of Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nThe future of edtech will be interesting.

Other participants in the round include Golden Palm Investments, LoftyInc Capital and Future Africa.\n\nWhat does Wowzi do? The startup turns social media users into brand influencers. With just 250 followers on social media, Wowzi can help you make money through influencing.\n\nWow! Oh yeah. It categorises influencers from nano, mega, meta, to super.\n\nAccording to Johnny Falla, Chief Development and Growth Officer at Wowzi, \u201cBrands want to have more authentic engagements or endorsements for products, from people who use and love them and can talk about real practical applications. Our campaigns show that nano influencers deliver better sales leads because of higher trust with their following,\u201d\n\nThe startup helps brands filter through influencers based on specific demographics such as age, income level, gender, and location.\n\nSo far, it has worked with 200 brands and carried out 15,000 campaigns since 2019. Wowzi is currently present in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. And the funding will be geared towards expanding into Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nA Barrel of Rotten Apples.

It\u2019s located in the fashion street district of Decentraland. A place where fashion shows and probably concerts will be held in the metaverse.\n\nWhile the idea still seems unreal, the amount of money being invested is very real.\n\nIn 2017, Decentraland raised $26 million in Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).\n\nIn fact, Facebook, one of the most valuable companies globally, changed its name to Meta and has spent $50 million on research into the metaverse.\n\nAlthough the metaverse might seem like the future everyone should get in on, there are still major barriers to entry, including money and education.\n\nThe cheapest piece of Decentraland land costs 3ETH, roughly $12,000. Besides being expensive, how does one find land in a virtual world?\n\nHowever, lands aren\u2019t the only form of investment on the metaverse; there\u2019s also gaming.\n\nNestcoin\u2019s new product, Metaverse Magna (MVM), is creating a path for Africans that\u2019ll ease them into the metaverse through games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is gaming on the metaverse all about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxie Infinity homepage\n\nBe it in the metaverse, on a PlayStation, or a mobile game, gaming is pretty much the same thing.\n\nBut in the metaverse, gaming is done a bit differently.\n\nAxie Infinity is, to date, the most established metaverse gaming platform. Unlike regular games, Axie Infinity exists on a blockchain which means you buy and sell characters, upgrades, and power-ups with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe platform, created in 2018 by a Vietnamese company called Sky Mavis, is currently valued at $3 billion.\n\nKnown simply as Axie, it allows gamers to earn as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nGamers on the platform grew to 1.8 million in August this year, and about 40% are from the Philippines.\n\nWhere does Nestcoin\u2019s Metaverse Magna come in?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaverse Magna home paage\n\nTo enter the brightly coloured metaverse with strange-looking game characters on Axie Infinity, you need to own gaming creatures or a variety of things known as assets.\n\nThese creatures, regardless of how weird they look, do not come cheap. According to Rest Of World, game assets can set you back as much as $1,500. That\u2019s over 2000% higher than Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nAccording to research by market research and data specialist firm, KLA, only 3% of the people who own crypto in South Africa have up to $3,000 worth of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile expensive Axie assets are a barrier, the metaverse is still in its infancy, and not many people understand how to get in.\n\nNestcoin\u2019s MVM wants to help players get these creatures while getting a percentage of their earnings. Something like AltSchool. for gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Metaverse Magna gamers.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, Onyinye Umeaka, MVM General Manager, said, \u201cWe are sponsoring anyone out there with access to the Internet, and just the commitment to improving their quality of life with an opportunity to earn a good living playing crypto games.\u201d\n\nShe said MVM would purchase the assets and create gaming accounts, lend the accounts to players willing to learn, play, and earn.\n\n\u201cAs the players play, they earn cryptocurrency, and based on the earnings, we split it between ourselves and the players, the players get to keep 70% based on performance, and then we get to keep 30%.\u201d\n\nGaming scholarships started in the Philippines\n\nWhile the rest of the world had the pandemic and lockdowns to contend with last year, the Philippines also struggled with typhoons and floods. And when it became almost impossible to get jobs, some people turned to gaming.\n\nPer Rest Of Worlds, \u201cWorkers in the Global South are making a living playing the blockchain game, Axie Infinity.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, there are platforms such as MVM that offer scholarships to gamers. For example, there\u2019s Yield Guild Games (YGG), managing up to 4,7000 players or scholars as they\u2019re called.\n\nEven VC\u2019s are investing\n\nYGG raised $4.6 million in August this year to accelerate play-to-earn gaming. Claiming to have earned up to $8.6 million with Axie Infinity, it plans to buy more gaming assets and onboard more scholars.\n\nAlthough nowhere near YGG, MVM is already making moves in crypto gaming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been running the experiment now for a couple of months. We actually have about 130 plus players already playing the games within our scholarship programme,\u201d Umeaka said.\n\nUnlike YGG, however, MVM is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). This means MVM is a community of players, community managers, and development managers.\n\nPlayers are coached and trained on strategies that will help them win games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn MVM gamer, playing games\n\nAlthough MVM seems more centralised than decentralised, Umeaka said it\u2019d be a DAO with its own tokens where gamers and investors will be the stakeholders.\n\nMVM was created in partnership with Old Fashion Research (OFR), a multi-strategy blockchain investment fund.\n\nNestcoin CEO and Co-founder, Yele Bademosi, believes the play-to-earn metaverse could get a lot of Africans out of poverty.\n\nHowever, Middle, Eastern, and Western Africa still have low Internet penetration rates of 26%, 24%, and 42%, respectively. Lower than the global average of 59.5%.\n\nWith the amount of volatility associated with all things crypto-related, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we can say for sure that crypto gaming will continue to be valuable.\n\nAuthor Bolu Abiodun He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "IP valuation in IP-based financing",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial institutions use different approaches to IP valuation as part of their financing process. One of the threshold considerations for lenders in evaluating whether and how much to loan a borrower using its IP as collateral is determining the scope and value of the company\u2019s IP portfolio. Unlike inventory and equipment, where established procedures can predict the value of such assets today and in the future, the value of a company\u2019s intellectual property assets is considered to be far more speculative.\n\n\u201cMaximizing Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets\u201d report (PDF) by the Athena Alliance, issued in 2009, provides context for financial institutions\u2019 approaches to IP and intangible asset-based financing. By highlighting effectively structured and completed Intangible Asset (IA) debt-and-equity arrangements, the Report addressed the fundamental difficulties in IA finance that face financial firms and corporations alike. The survey found that the most major barrier to increased interest and involvement in IA finance is the uncertainty around intangible asset valuation.\n\nValuation plays a different role in IP financing, based on two considerations: (1) Present and future cash flow for the purpose of servicing the loan repayment plan; and (2) Value to cover the investment in the event of default.\n\nSome financial quarters view the use of certain forms of IP as collateral to be problematic because the financial firm is ultimately concerned with the revenue-generating potential of the asset on which the firm is basing its investment in the company. If it is to be valued in the event of default, which is of paramount importance to the potential creditor, this revenue generation must be able to be achieved independently, even partially, from the company.\n\nIt has been argued that for banks to lend positively and directly against the value of IP and intangibles in isolation (setting aside regulatory considerations), it is necessary for the bank to be confident that it can dispose of the IP separately from the business if the need should arise, in much the same way as it can expect to do with an item of tangible property.\n\nBarriers to IP-based financing for startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\n\nDespite its potential for innovation financing, IP-based finance is widely believed to be underexploited, by young startups that would need it most. Intangible assets account for more than half of the enterprise value in most startups. Startups typically seek external funding in the form of equity financing, but this can also be challenging. There are additional levels of uncertainty in the valuation of early-stage technologies.\n\nIn some cases, the extent of complementary assets necessary to generate earnings may be unknown. The degree of uncertainty in the development trajectory influences the valuation approach chosen, but it does not invalidate the valuation process entirely. These considerations are generally incorporated into licensing negotiations and can be accounted for in a valuation. However, the asset\u2019s risk profile and the range of probable outcomes should be reflected in the valuation report.\n\nFor investors, particularly business angels and venture capitalists, the presence of IP acts as signals on the quality of the company. The key distinction between debt and equity financing is that equity investors invest in the entire company rather than just the IP. As a result, they typically assess the company\u2019s expected profitability without assigning a specific financial valuation to the IP. Because the enterprise\u2019s technology is new and unproven, and the enterprise lacks an established market, IP valuation may not work for startups. A VC may be more interested in IP value at exit, particularly if the purchaser is a corporation.\n\nIn a research commissioned by the European Commission Expert Group on Valuation, in identifying significant differences in the approach to lending to SMEs and start-ups compared with larger corporates that have a strong trading history, it was observed that IP is mostly evaluated and not formally valued in the regular banking, VC, or Private Equity sectors. Liens, warrants, and debentures on IP assets, as well as numbers relating to IP capitalized on the balance sheet, may be examined \u2013 but only as risk factors, not as part of a formal IP valuation. This reluctance in the IP valuation market may be attributed to information asymmetry, regulatory lapses and market immaturity.\n\nVenture debt as an alternative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Iwaria via Iwaria.com\n\nWith the growing recognition of the value of IP assets, there are a few segments of the regulated credit market that have devoted themselves exclusively to serving startups and high-growth companies in the tech industry. These segments are described as \u201coutlier banks\u201d. Outlier banks, in particular, lend to early-stage and late-growth stage enterprises that have already obtained venture capital investment.\n\nThe lending decisions made by the outlier banks are based on the probability that the VC-backed companies will secure subsequent rounds of equity money from investors. This type of financing, known as venture debt, is a hybrid equity-and-debt financing structure that allows businesses to borrow money in the form of a loan while also offering warrants for equity in the company in addition to the loan interest. This arrangement offers the loan issuer with a considerable upside as an incentive to lend to an otherwise risky enterprise.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough established valuation methods for IP exists in Nigeria, it has, however, not gained mainstream acceptance, and valuation is still mostly seen within the context of tangible property. Nigerian banks must understand that there is a significant difference in the approach to lending to SMEs and start-ups when compared to larger corporates with a strong trading history. A solution is required to fund the commercialization of innovative ideas using the value of the intellectual property asset as collateral. There is a clear need to increase market actors\u2019 confidence and certainty in IP valuation methods in order to stimulate IP transactions, support IP-based financing, and provide companies with tools to provide information about their intellectual property.\n\nThere is a need to develop new financial market segments dedicated to the valuation, exchange, and financing of IPRs and other intangibles, by establishing the necessary pre-conditions and infrastructures for such markets to operate efficiently and effectively on a global scale.\n\nAuthor Mosun Oke Mosun is a consummate Attorney with wide experience in Corporate/Commercial, Intellectual Property and Competition/Anti-trust law practice.

          "text": "Nigeria is among the 74 countries that would benefit from a $93 billion replenishment package of the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association (IDA) for low-income countries (LIC), a new report by the World Bank indicated.\n\nThe World Bank Thursday announced a $93 billion replenishment package of the International Development Association (IDA) to help low-income countries respond to the COVID-19 crisis and build a greener, more resilient, and inclusive future.\n\nThe financing brings together $23.5 billion of contributions from 48 high- and middle-income countries with financing raised in the capital markets, repayments, and the World Bank\u2019s contributions.\n\nDue to the urgent development needs of IDA countries, the World Bank said the replenishment was advanced by one year.\n\nIDA20 will cover the period of July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2025. The IDA20 policy architecture builds on the strong foundation of IDA19, with enhancements to make IDA20 even more ambitious and fit for today\u2019s challenges, the World Bank said.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s IDA, which was established in 1960, helps the world\u2019s poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people\u2019s lives. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world\u2019s 74 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa.\n\nAccording to the Global Bank, eligibility for IDA support depends first and foremost on a country\u2019s relative poverty, defined as Gross National Income (GNI) per capita below an established threshold and updated annually ($1,205 in the fiscal year 2022).\n\nIDA also supports some countries, including several small island economies that are above the operational cutoff but lack the creditworthiness needed to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).\n\nRead also: Bankers C\u2019ttee to focus on infrastructure development in 2022- CBN\n\nSome countries, such as Nigeria and Pakistan, are IDA-eligible based on per capita income levels and are also creditworthy for some IBRD borrowing. They are referred to as \u201cblend\u201d countries.\n\nA total of 74 countries are currently eligible to receive IDA resources.\n\nThe financing package agreed over a two-day meeting hosted virtually by Japan, is the largest ever mobilization in IDA\u2019s 61-year history. IDA\u2019s unique leveraging model enables it to achieve greater value from donor resources \u2013 every $1 that donors contribute to IDA is now leveraged into almost $4 of financial support for the poorest countries.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s generous commitment by our partners is a critical step toward supporting poor countries in their efforts to recover from the COVID-19 crisis,\u201d said World Bank Group President David Malpass.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the confidence our partners have in IDA as a non-fragmented and efficient platform to tackle development challenges and improve the lives of millions of people around the world.\u201d\n\nThe funds will be delivered to the world\u2019s 74 poorest countries under the 20th replenishment (IDA20) program, which focuses on helping countries recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIn these countries, the ongoing pandemic is worsening poverty, undermining growth, and jeopardizing the prospects of resilient and inclusive development. Countries are struggling with falling government revenues; increasing debt vulnerabilities; rising risks to fragility, conflict, and instability; and dropping literacy rates. About a third of IDA countries are facing a looming food crisis.\n\nTo help countries build back greener, a substantial portion of these funds go to tackling climate change, with a focus on helping countries adapt to rising climate impacts and preserve biodiversity. IDA will also deepen support to countries to better prepare for future crises, including pandemics, financial shocks, and natural hazards.\n\nWhile IDA20 will support countries globally, resources are increasingly benefiting Africa, which will receive about 70 percent of the funding.\n\nWith this strong package, IDA will be able to scale up its support in the pandemic and address health challenges, helping 400 million people receive essential health and nutrition resources.\n\nThe social safety nets program is also expected to reach as many as 375 million people.\n\nThe country benefited from the World Bank\u2019s IDA financing for strong Covid-19 vaccines, health professionals\u2019 training, and hospital equipment in IDA19 achievements, which was key to IDA20.\n\nThe IDA20 program has more ambitious policy commitments that will support countries in prioritizing investments in human capital, covering issues such as education, health and nutrition, vaccines, safety nets, and support for people with disabilities.\n\nIDA will also increase its ambition in addressing other major development challenges such as gender inequality, job creation, and situations of fragility, conflict, and violence, including in the Sahel, the Lake Chad region, and the Horn of Africa.\n\nA continued emphasis on governance and institutions, debt sustainability, and digital infrastructure interventions will help foster economic and social inclusion.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Wednesday in Abuja, winged four pilots and 12 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operators who successfully completed their Basic Helicopter Pilot Training at the Draken Europe Helicopter Academy, U.K.\n\nThe Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, expressed delight for the additional expertise in the NAF ever-expanding inventory of manned and unmanned aircraft systems.\n\nAmao noted that the training was part of his vison of enhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for deployment in pursuit of national security imperatives.\n\n\u201dI am glad to note that, through foresight and diligence, we are effectively engaging one of the key drivers of my vision which is to pursue purposeful training and human capacity development.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing is based on the premise that, for NAF to function efficiently, both as a highly technical service and as a fighting force for the effective defence of Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, it must have the right numerical strength.\n\n\u201cAnd, more importantly, the right quality of manpower in all relevant competencies.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have continued to train personnel of all specialties both locally and abroad.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, officers, airmen and airwomen of the service are undergoing training in various countries including the U.S., South Africa, India, Belgium, Egypt and Pakistan, among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition, hundreds of personnel across all specialties are being trained locally in spite of budgetary constraints.\n\n\u201cIn the area of pilot training, 11 student pilots are currently undergoing training in South Africa, while three are undergoing Alpha Jet conversion in Egypt.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, 12 student pilots are undergoing Super Tucano training and four student pilots are undergoing helicopter training in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIndeed, two of these student helicopter pilots have completed their training and are expected to graduate very soon.\u201d\n\nThe CAS added that, within the country, 12 student pilots are undergoing Basic Fighter Training while two have recently completed jet conversion at 403 Flying Training School, Kano.\n\nHe added that 12 student pilots were undergoing Basic Transport Training, 32 undergoing Ab-Initio Flying Training and eight undergoing Instructor Training at 401 Flying Training School, Kaduna.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 22 trainees are undergoing UAV Initial and Basic Training at 401 FTS, while 16 student pilots are undergoing Helicopter Pilot Training at the International Helicopter Flying School Enugu.\u201c\n\nAmao explained that all these efforts were targeted at ensuring combat readiness at significantly higher levels to counter both domestic and foreign threats to the nation\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of this, we also recently reviewed the curricula for the various schools in the NAF Institute of Technology to meet expected standards, while also conducting instructional training for the instructors to ensure enhanced performance.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the training curriculum for NAF cadets in the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) has been reviewed and new criteria specified for NAF officers that can be eligible for posting to the Academy as instructors.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I authorised the audit of selected ground and flying institutions in NAF by a team of experienced retired senior officers with a view to upgrading the practices and facilities at the institutions to meet international standards.\u201c\n\nAmao noted that the ongoing efforts would go a long way in positioning the institutions as centres of excellence in producing pilots, engineers, technicians and other specialists.\n\nThis, he said, would avail the personnel the opportunity to be well equipped to carry out their constitutional roles more effectively and efficiently in the defence of the territorial integrity of the country.\n\n\u201cSpecial arrangements are also currently being made to upgrade UAV training facilities to enhance the operational capacity of UAV operators in anticipation of increased tempo of air operations with the recently acquired UAVs.\n\n\u201cWhile sustaining capacity building programmes for the NAF Regiment in joint efforts for synergy of air-ground integrated operations with sister services.\u201c\n\nThe CAS congratulated the young pilots and UAVs operators for successfully completing their various courses.\n\n\u201cYou have put in the necessary hard work to get to this stage and your efforts have been recognised with the pinning of wings on your uniforms.\n\n\u201cYou have therefore, left the stage of student aviators and have become pilots and UAV operators responsible for utilisation of national resources in our counter-insurgency and other security efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that you apply and build on your current experiences during your pre-deployment tactical training.\n\n\u201cLike I advised the last set of pilots and UAV operators, you must be relentless in the pursuit of excellence and professionalism as operational pilots and operators, while working with your colleagues across other specialties in the service.\n\n\u201cYou must also strive to imbibe the doctrine of jointness at the frontlines as you interact with personnel from our sister services and other security agencies in pursuit of national securities imperatives.\u201c\n\nAmao thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for providing the enabling environment for NAF and the entire Armed Forces to function more effectively.\n\nEarlier, the Chief of Training and Operations, AVM James Gwani, noted that the winging was the 5th under the administration of Amao.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the young pilots would boost NAF\u2019s operational manpower, especially as the service was inducting and expecting more platforms to address the various security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cI most sincerely express profound gratitude and appreciation to CAS, whose leadership has created the enabling environment for timely turn out of pilots and UAV operators in the NAF.\n\n\u201cTo the pilots and UAV operators, tomorrow brings a new journey, but today marks the end of a chapter in your career as you have become qualified pilots and UAV operators.\u201d\n\n...",

The stakes are too high; we cannot allow Nigeria to continue the way it is going.\n\n\u201cOur great party must come to the rescue and take over the reins of power in this country. What we see ahead is not pleasant at all. I just pray that God Almighty sees us through next year, financially, so that we can even have presidential elections.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t just see how we can continue to be deceiving ourselves. We try to prevent the country from growing by limiting and restricting imports, coming with all forms of phantom excuses to limit people from buying and importing what they cannot produce and need to live.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, they are restricting foreign exchange availability; they are just throwing millions of Nigerians into poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy commitment today is to our great party, the PDP. I accept the responsibility of leading our e-registration process. We have done a very successful pilot in Edo, which I am hoping that the new committee will adopt so that we can roll out and build membership across the country. The soul of our democracy is making sure that we build our party like institutions,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nAddressing members of the delegation, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe decision is of the majority of our people, which is the way we will go. Atiku Abubakar is a Nigerian that is committed to this country; his achievements are visible. So, he is eminently qualified to contest the position of President of Nigeria and as you know, at the end of the day, power ultimately comes from God.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Dokpesi commended the governor for his giant strides and transformational projects embarked upon by his administration since he assumed office.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe way and manner that people are suffering across the country is not acceptable. We have never been so divided as a nation; everybody now refers to us as the poverty capital of the world. All the indices clearly show that we are a failed state.\n\n\u201cEven in Abuja, we are afraid of the possibility of invasion by Boko Haram, bandits, and unknown gunmen.

          "text": "The United Kingdom (UK) government yesterday removed Nigeria and 10 other African countries from the controversial red list under which it banned flights from African countries, following the outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in South Africa.\n\nThis is even as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has conceded seven slots to Air Peace to end the diplomatic row with Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the British High Commission in Abuja this decision followed the review of the latest risk assessment from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), stressing that Nigeria and the other 10 countries and territories on the red list will be removed from 4am Wednesday 15 December.\n\nThe statement said that \u201call passengers arriving from Nigeria, Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe will not have to stay in a managed quarantine hotel on arrival in England from this date.\n\nThe UK said further that while all countries have now been removed from the red list, the managed quarantine hotel policy remains in place to act as a crucial line of defence against the importation of variants of concern.\n\nLEADERSHIP had earlier reported that the red list was to be rescinded just two weeks after it was introduced, following intense pressures from Nigerian travelers and the Nigerian government, which threatened retaliation.\n\nThe UK government added Nigeria to the travel red list from Monday December 6, noting that people traveling to the UK from any country will need to take a pre-departure test from December\n\nThe red list was greeted with severe protests from officials in Nigeria and other affected African countries, as travelers in quarantine complained of six-hour journeys to hotels and \u201cgrim\u201d food.\n\nThe red list forced thousands into hotel quarantine at a cost of \u00a32,285 per person for 10 days.\n\nBowing to pressure, the British government noted in a statement: \u201cAll vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK must continue to take a pre-departure test two days or less before they depart for the UK and must take a PCR test on or before day 2 and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\n\n\u201cThese testing measures are vital in helping to prevent any additional cases of Omicron from entering the UK and stopping people from passing it on to others.\u201d\n\nIt said that as Omicron cases rise in the UK and in countries around the world, the travel red list is less effective in slowing the incursion of the variant from abroad and these temporary measures are no longer proportionate.\n\nIt noted that the red list has successfully served its purpose in delaying the spread of Omicron into the UK to buy time for scientists to learn more about this variant.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical phase in tackling the Omicron and the Government\u2019s focus remains on slowing the spread of the variant in the UK \u2013 through maintaining testing requirements at the border, through the introduction of Plan B measures, and by turbocharging the booster rollout.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday 14th December, UK Ministers made the decision \u2013 based on scientific and public health data \u2013 to remove Nigeria from the UK\u2019s travel red list. The emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and like all countries around the world the UK has had to take difficult decisions to protect public health.\n\n\u201cWe took this necessary precautionary action to give us time to understand the challenge we and others faced, and to slow down the spread of Omicron while scientists urgently assessed what impact the variant has on vaccines, treatments and transmissibility.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen we announced the heightened restrictions we made clear that we would remove them as soon as we could, and that is the decision Ministers have taken today.\n\n\u201cI know this will be welcome news for students, tourists, businesses and families in the UK and Nigeria, although I recognise the impact that these temporary health measures have had,\u201d the statement added.\n\nUK Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, also said, \u201cThe red list bought our scientists time to learn more about Omicron and to slow the seeding of the variant from abroad into the UK. Now that there are high levels of community transmission, it is right to remove the red list and focus on our national effort to tackle Omicron.\n\n\u201cWith cases doubling every two to three days we\u2019ve turbocharged our booster programme, we\u2019re asking arrivals to keep testing to limit the spread of new cases, and we are introducing Plan B measures to protect the country from the threat of this new variant.\u201d\n\nJavid however warned that \u201crestrictions will be re-imposed should there be a need to do so to protect public health\u201d.\n\nHe said also that airlines will continue to check all passengers for pre-departure tests alongside their completed Passenger Locator Form, even as passengers will not be allowed to board a flight without providing evidence of a negative test result.\n\n\u201cThe government will take further action if necessary to contain the virus and the new variant, as has been the case throughout the pandemic. The UKHSA continues to monitor the situation closely, in partnership with scientific and public health organisations across the world, and the government is working collaboratively with the World Health Organisation and countries around the world to better understand the new variant,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has conceded seven slots to Air Peace to end the diplomatic row with Nigeria.\n\nThis was after the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) withdrew the ministerial approval granted Emirates Airlines by the Ministry of Aviation over reduction of Air Peace slot to Sharjah Airport.\n\nIt was also gathered that the UAE\u2019s Authority granted the Nigerian carrier the permit to fly directly to Dubai instead of Sharjah Airport, it was learnt.\n\nThe General Civil Aviation Authority, it was learnt, sent a December 13, 2021 letter to Air Peace, though the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not copied in breach of protocol.\n\nThe federal government was however said to have received the letter.\n\nIn a letter obtained by LEADERSHIP yesterday with reference number DCAA/ASA/N-3/014 and addressed to the chairman, Air Peace, Allen Onyema, the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA), the authority said slots have been provided for Air Peace at Dubai Airport.\n\nThe letter signed by the director general of DCAA, Mohammed Ahii, said relationship between the two countries have gone a long way and cannot be allowed to go sour.\n\nThe DCAA said that the slots cannot be provided indefinitely and urged them to respond to the offer on or before Thursday December 20, 2021.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cWe write in reference to Air Peace\u2019s possible/intended operations to/from Dubai Airports (DXB). We have received information from Dubai Airports, with regard to slot availability at DX8 Terminal 1 and as a gesture of goodwill and in support of UAE and Nigeria relations, in case Air Peace wishes to start their flights, slots have been blocked by Dubai Airports.\n\n\u201cSlots available and blocked for Air Peace are the following: AOSSOLT DOSOOLT \u2013 All days and A0S10LT DOSOOLT \u2013 without day 6 .\n\n\u201cAs these slots cannot be blocked indefinitely, we would highly appreciate it if Air Peace could kindly reach out to Dubai Airports -ACL and inform them of their intentions to operate by Thursday 16th December, 2021 and accordingly confirm the blocked slots.\n\n\u201cDubai Airports have also confirmed that dnata \u2014 the ground handling agents at OXB have sent the ground handling quotation to Ms. Reham Mustafa \u2014 Country Manager and also, Emirates Flight Catering is working on the quotation and should send it out latest by tomorrow morning.\n\n\u201d For landing permissions, they could contact our Air Transport Section as detailed below: Landing Permissions: air.transport@dcaa.gov.\u201d\n\nBut Air Peace has denounced knowledge of any letter offering them seven slots to Dubai.\n\nOne of the managers of the airline who did not want his name in print because he was not authorised to talk on the matter said nothing has changed as the airline can still not fly into the UAE.\n\nAccording to the source, the laid down procedure is for the government of the UAE to write directly to the Nigerian government and not to Air Peace directly, even if such a letter existed.\n\nHe queried the sincerity of the UAE government in ending the fiasco, saying \u201cif they are ready to end the crisis, are they not supposed to write to the Nigerian government? They should write to us because this is a diplomatic issue and the diplomatic procedure is for them to write to Nigerian government and not Air Peace\u201d.",

          "text": "Xola Collective, an independent, not-for-profit, non-partisan think tank based in Abuja, was born in the midst of adversity in Q3, 2021.\n\nAt that time a storm was instigated by some vested interests who wanted the head of the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on a platter.\n\nThe issues ranged from exchange rate to inflation and the introduction of the e-Naira.\n\nWe took the dispassionate view that, as we say in one part of the country, what is behind six is more than seven. Yes, there were serious problems confronting the country, but it was simplistic, if not naive and outright mischievous, to put all the blame on the CBN.\n\nOn the contrary, if there is one institution that has risen to the challenge of confronting Nigeria\u2019s fundamental structural economic problems, mostly inherited by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, the CBN under the leadership of Emefiele, has been that institution \u2013 tackling everything from poor agricultural output to low incentives by providing strategic interventions and vigorously pursuing financial inclusion.\n\nIn this series for the next three days, we share with fellow compatriots a recap of some vital interventions by the bank, because where there is no recollection, the people are easily misled. It\u2019s important to remember those moments without which things might have been worse.\n\nDefending, Growing Nigeria\u2019s Economy\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe far-reaching interventions of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in various sectors have shielded the nation\u2019s economy from collapse, especially from a deep post-COVID-19 crisis. The story would have been different if not for the interventions by the apex bank. Series of interventions by the CBN through targeted policy instruments have been the springboard for modest growth recorded in the economy.\n\nThe CBN, in 2021, has sustained its continuous dual roles of combining a mixture of monetary and a bit of fiscal measures in boosting economic growth. With 37 strategic interventions, it is now clear that, had the apex bank stood aloof, concerned primarily with the monetary policy roles carved for it in constitution, the economy would have been in red aftermath of COVID-19 wreckage.\n\nThe CBN has been implementing various development finance programmes aimed at diversifying the economy particularly in the agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare and other non-oil sectors. The interventions include the Anchor Borrowers Programme, the Real Sector Support Facility, Export Stimulation Scheme and the Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the CBN, in 2019, began sectoral support across some select commodities with value addition to the economy. The bank designed financial interventions for various sectors. There is intervention for manufacturing/industries, agriculture, energy/infrastructure, healthcare and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).\n\nWhat They Said:\n\n\u201cIt is commendable\u201d, President, Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, on the Federal Government\u2019s N100 billion intervention, through the CBN, to provide pharmaceutical companies and medical practitioners low interest rate loans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.",

I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election was really not completed,\u201d he said.\n\nOyinlola explained that the state government asked the contractor to come back to site and complete the works, more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid.\n\nHe said the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\n\nAccording to Oyinlola, the consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues, adding that one of Akande\u2019s own appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\nThe former military administrator added that he consulted Akande on this and that he denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant.\n\nHe said some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge, but that stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened.\n\n\u201cI have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book,\u201d he said.\n\nOyinlola further said Akande wrote that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa road in Osogbo which he stopped and that he found it strange that Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election, and in advance, paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million.\n\nHe stated that Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book, stressing that this was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners but that he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a government house after losing his re-election.\n\nOyinlola said in any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government which Akande refused to complete, saying that he completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge.\n\nHe stated that everything was completed and commissioned within his first year in office, saying that the state had continued to use the structures till date.",

          "text": "Decisive actions taken by President Muhammadu Buhari stopped Boko Haram insurgents from declaring an Islamic State in Nigeria, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed has said.\n\nSpeaking at a media parley Wednesday in Abuja, the minister who acknowledged banditry and kidnapping posed a great challenge in the nation\u2019s fight against insecurity, however, said the Buhari administration was providing quality leadership to halt the menace.\n\nObasanjo\u2019s \u2018tantrum\u2019\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo had in the week said expecting more from Buhari was like \u201cwhipping a dead horse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is this. President Buhari has done his best. That is what he can do. If we are expecting anything more than what he has done or what he is doing, that means we\u2019re whipping a dead horse and there is no need,\u201d Obasanjo was quoted to have said.\n\nLai replies\n\nAnd in a veiled response to the former president\u2019s comment, the minister said such statement smacks was \u201cuntrue, fallacious and smacks of dirty politicking.\u201d\n\nThe minister said the president had the capacity to do more in addition to what he had done under very difficult economic and social conditions, to tackle insecurity in the country.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cThe polity has recently been awash with heightened commentary on the security situation in the country. The commentary has been triggered by genuine concerns in some circles, and crass politicking or sheer absurdity in others.\n\n\u201cYes, the security situation has continued to pose a great challenge, but amidst the cacophony of voices \u2013 some genuinely concerned about the situation and others ready to exploit it for selfish ends \u2013 it is easy to forget where we are coming from.\n\n\u201cToday, we only look at the current situation, without wondering what would have been had this president not taken the bull by the horns, as far as security is concerned.\n\n\u201cWith the way, the insurgents were going before this Administration came into office, with their control of a vast swath of land the size of Belgium, with their freewheeling attacks in almost a dozen states, including the Federal Capital Territory which was hit at least five times, perhaps they could have achieved their aim of declaring an Islamic State in Nigeria if President Buhari had not acted decisively.\u201d\n\nIn further admitting the rising trend in the nation\u2019s security challenge, Mohammed said: \u201cYes, banditry and kidnapping have added to the state of insecurity, President Buhari has also continued to provide quality leadership in order to ensure that our security agencies decisively tackle the cankerworm of insecurity of any hue.\n\n\u201cNo administration in Nigeria\u2019s recent history has provided the security agencies with the hardware needed to tackle insecurity as that of President Buhari, in addition to raising the morale of our security men and women.\n\n\u201cOnly last week, Mr President commissioned an armada of naval boats and ships in the latest effort to enhance our nation\u2019s maritime security. The army, the air force and the police, among others, have also been receiving modern hardware to strengthen their arsenal.\n\n\u201cThe Administration has not concentrated on the kinetic measures alone. Non-kinetic measures have also been strengthened. The establishment of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development to coordinate all humanitarian affairs in Nigeria is a major effort at tackling poverty and shrinking the pool of those being targeted for recruitment by insurgents and bandits.\n\n\u201cOf course, the Federal Government\u2019s unprecedented and massive investment in infrastructure is also aimed at boosting socio-economic well-being of the nation and further reducing poverty, which is a major cause of insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cDespite all this, President Buhari has not relented, constantly presiding over meetings of security chiefs to get an update and also issue necessary directives, and not missing any opportunity to offer succour to his countrymen and women, when necessary. The skewed narrative in certain quarters that the President has not shown enough empathy is glib talk.\n\n\u201cThe President has also continued to work with our neighbouring countries and indeed our Western partners to tackle insecurity, especially terrorism. With the entire Sahelian region experiencing a devastating surge in terrorist attacks, more so in the wake of the Libyan crisis, it has become even more imperative for Nigeria to step up regional cooperation to more effectively tackle insecurity \u2013 and that is what Mr President has been doing.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, President Buhari has done so much, under very difficult economic and social conditions, to tackle insecurity in our country. Not only has he done so much. President Buhari continues to do much more to keep Nigerians safe.\n\n\u201cTo say he has nothing more to offer is untrue, fallacious and smacks of dirty politicking. By boosting the number and capacity of our fighting forces, Mr President is putting them in good stead to tackle insecurity not just during the life of his Administration but long after he would have left office.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is leaving a legacy of security, infrastructural development, economic prosperity and social cohesion for Nigeria. This may not seem obvious today, amidst daunting challenges, but posterity will be kind to this President.\u201d\n\nSlain Kaduna lawmaker\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman House Committee on Local Government and Rural Development and member representing Giwa West in Kaduna State House of Assembly, Hon. Lirwanu Aminu Gadagau was killed Monday night by bandits.\n\nSpeaker of the House Yusuf Zailani, who confirmed the member\u2019s death Wednesday, said the lawmaker was one of those killed by bandits along Kaduna-Zaria highway Monday night.\n\nSpeaking in a condolence statement signed by his SA Media and Publicity, Hon. Ibrahim Dahiru Danfulani, the Speaker said the body of the lawmaker was discovered in a morgue Wednesday as one of those killed by the bandits on that ill-fated day.\n\nDescribing the lawmaker\u2019s death as devastating and tragic, the Speaker said, \u201che died during bandits attack along Zaria highway. This is tragic and painful. We are in deep grief over this sad incident.\n\n\u201cOur prayers at this time, goes to his immediate family. Honourable Gadagau was a young and dynamic lawmaker, who had a passion for his constituency, state and Nigeria. We will miss his vibrant contributions.\u201d\n\nHe prayed Almighty Allah to grant him Aljannah Firdaus, grant the state, the Assembly and his family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss\n\nZailani also commiserated with the families of others who were killed and those kidnapped by the bandits during the same attack. \u201cOur hearts also go out to those kidnapped in same operation, believing that they would be rescued by security operatives as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u20265 abducted in Zaria\n\nAlso, the bandits again, abducted five people in Dallatu and Kasuwar Da\u2019a areas of Dutsen Abba in Zaria local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nThis is happening 24 hours after bandits blocked the Kaduna-Zaria expressway and killed three people while abducting scores.\n\nKaduna state Police Command is yet to react to reports of the attack on the two communities but residents said the bandits, who stormed Dallatu village around 1.00am Wednesday, kidnapped two people and proceeded to Kasuwar Da\u2019a village where they abducted six others, amongst them three children.\n\nSources said three children were released Wednesday morning leaving five people in captivity.\n\nBandits had attacked motorists plying the Kaduna-Zaria expressway in an operation that lasted close to three hours and claimed the lives of three commuters.\n\nTaxes to bandits in Niger\n\nIn a related development, t Niger state government has directed citizens in communities under attacks to stop paying taxes and levies imposed by bandits, assuring the administration had intensified efforts to flush out the criminals.\n\nCommissioner of Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security Emmanuel Umar stated this Wednesday while speaking to journalists in Minna.\n\nHe said the government was aware the bandits had imposed taxes and other levies on farmers before harvest of farm products.\n\n\u201cThese criminals are trying to extort the farmers by imposing taxes to harvest their farm produce. This has to stop immediately. We therefore urge communities to support the security agencies in flushing out the bandits. We also want to assure that we are doing everything possible to ensure that the criminals don\u2019t have space in our communities,\u201d Umar said.\n\nThe commissioner urged farmers in the state to go on with the harvesting of their farm crops, urging them to ignore the criminal threat.\n\n\u201cSome Criminal elements in Rumbun Giwa in Mashegu local government area of Niger state recently wrote under the name Kungiyan Manuma ordering all farmers to pay some specific levies and taxes before they can access their farms to harvest their farm produce,\u201d the commissioner further said.\n\nHe said the state government was very much alive to its responsibilities and putting modalities in place to ensure those behind the threat were apprehended and brought to book.\n\n\u201cSome unpatriotic people are fuelling insecurity and crisis in the state, but Government is up to its responsibility,\u201d Umar added",

          "text": "The statistics by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) have revealed that 434 cases of Lassa fever have been recorded in Nigeria in 2021.\n\nAccording to NCDC\u2019s recent Lassa Fever situation report, at least 80 persons were confirmed to have died of the disease this year.\n\nThe states affected by the infections include Edo (192), Ondo (150), Taraba (21), Ebonyi (17), Bauchi (15), Benue (8), Plateau (8), Kaduna (7), Enugu (5), Nasarawa (3), Kogi (3), Cross River (1), Imo (1), Anambra (1), Delta (1), and Abia (1).\n\n\u201cThe disease is endemic in Nigeria like in several other countries in West Africa, and most cases are seen during the dry season, often between November and May. Since January 2021, a total of 434 confirmed cases with 80 deaths (i.e., a case fatality rate of 18%) have been reported from seventeen (17) States and sixty-three (63) Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Nigeria.

Currently, seven laboratories have the capacity to test for Lassa fever in Nigeria and this is coordinated by the NCDC National Reference Laboratory (NRL). This has improved active case detection and care for affected individuals which may have gone unnoticed five years ago. In addition, Nigeria through NCDC is participating in the largest-ever Lassa fever study supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) to provide an accurate assessment of the incidence of the disease in West Africa. This is also geared towards the development of vaccine and therapeutics for Lassa fever,\u201d the NCDC report read in part.\n\nAccording to the report, two persons died from Lassa fever on the 8th of December.\n\nThe first case was a pregnant woman who presented in a health facility in Nasarawa State and the next one, a medical doctor involved in the management of the patient that later sought medical care in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIn addition, another medical doctor linked to the index case has also been confirmed to have Lassa fever and he is currently receiving medical care in FCT. The Nasarawa State Ministry of Health with support of NCDC has commenced an in-depth epidemiological investigation of the cases to understand the possible source of infection and the extent of the spread of the disease. Contact tracing of all the close contacts of the patients has commenced.",

          "text": "Chelsea\u2019s Premier League title challenge suffered a major setback as Everton snatched a 1-1 draw just hours after four of the European champions\u2019 stars tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday.\n\nThomas Tuchel\u2019s side were without Romelu Lukaku, Timo Werner and Callum Hudson-Odoi after the latest Covid-19 outbreak to rock the Premier League.\n\nBen Chilwell, currently injured, also tested positive, while Kai Havertz was unable to play after feeling ill before the match.\n\nThe Blues were already without Mateo Kovacic as the Croatia midfielder recovers having contracted the virus earlier in December.\n\nShorn of so many key players, Chelsea laboured to break down stubborn Everton until Mason Mount netted midway through the second half at Stamford Bridge.\n\nDespite dominating from start to finish, Chelsea were punished for switching off at the back when Jarrad Branthwaite grabbed Everton\u2019s equaliser with 16 minutes left.\n\nIt was the 19-year-old defender\u2019s first goal for Everton in just his third Premier League start.\n\nFailing to beat a struggling Everton side decimated by injuries and illness was a hammer blow on a difficult day for Chelsea.\n\nHaving led the table for several weeks, Tuchel\u2019s third placed team are now four points behind leaders Manchester City.\n\nChelsea have won only two of their last five league games as they lost ground on City and second placed Liverpool.\n\nWith five games scheduled for this weekend called off due to Covid cases, and four others postponed at various times in the last week, Tuchel insisted he did not push for Chelsea\u2019s game to be cancelled.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t lose any concentration or energy with questions like this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some point it\u2019s getting difficult in terms of overuse of players, but I was not involved in these thoughts.\u201d\n\nThe battling draw was a welcome sight for under-fire Everton boss Rafael Benitez, whose team have won only one of their last 11 league games.\n\nA banner reading \u201cBenitez \u2013 get out of our club\u201d was unfurled by Everton fans before kick-off.\n\nBut it was the Chelsea supporters who were booing at full-time after their side\u2019s latest frustrating result.\n\nREAD ALSO: Barcelona To Play Napoli In Europa League Knockout Play-Offs\n\nOver-worked Pickford\n\nReece James should have put Chelsea ahead in the opening minutes, but the defender blasted over after sprinting onto Jorginho\u2019s pass.\n\nJordan Pickford repelled James\u2019 free-kick before Mount had a golden opportunity to reward Chelsea\u2019s blistering start.\n\nMount collected Antonio Rudiger\u2019s pass six yards from goal, yet once again Pickford came to Everton\u2019s rescue as he saved with his out-stretched foot.\n\nChelsea finished the half with 81 percent of the possession and it was a similar story after the interval.\n\nMount\u2019s deflected effort was clawed to safety by the over-worked Pickford, who breathed a sigh of relief when Ruben Loftus-Cheek glanced the resulting corner over from close range.\n\nWhen Rudiger headed James\u2019 free-kick wide, Tuchel had seen enough of Chelsea\u2019s profligacy.\n\nHe sent on Ross Barkley and Saul Niguez for Alonso and Loftus-Cheek and the changes reaped an immediate reward in the 70th minute.\n\nIn a flash, Barkley found James and he slipped a deft pass to Mount, who timed his run into the area perfectly before planting a composed finish past Pickford at the near post.\n\nThe 22-year-old\u2019s seventh goal this season was his fourth in his last four Premier League appearances.\n\nThat should have been the spark for Chelsea to finish the job but a lapse in concentration allowed Everton to equalise against the run of play four minutes later.\n\nAnthony Gordon\u2019s free-kick looped towards the far post and Branthwaite sneaked in behind the dozing Chelsea defence to poke home from close range.\n\nPickford ensured Everton held on as the man of the match made a brilliant stop from Thiago Silva\u2019s header.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Three Days to Deadline, Buhari Keeps Nigerians in Suspense Over Electoral Bill",
          "text": "Despite appeals from different quarters to President Muhammadu Buhari, including the diplomatic community, to sign the amended electoral bill forwarded to him by the National Assembly on November 19, the president has continued to keep the people in suspense even when it is three days to the 30 days deadline within which he is constitutionally mandated to assent to the bill or return same to the legislature.\n\nAlthough the president has not hinted at any possibility since he received the electoral bill, the bill has, however, been mired in controversy between those urging Buhari to sign it in order to enhance participatory democracy as indicated through the approval of direct primaries and those who have reservations about that model of electing candidates by political parties.\n\nHowever, while a political party, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), has accused the president of failing to assent, a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Timothy Golu, has expressed optimism that Buhari would sign the bill eventually.\n\nRecently, some newspapers\u2019 reports had alleged that the president might have caved in to pressure from some governors of his party, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and withheld his assent to the bill, because of the excuse that direct primaries would be too expensive to run.\n\nBut the presidency and the National Assembly had quickly come out to dismiss it as untrue. While one of Buhari\u2019s spokespersons, Mallam Garba Shehu, said he had not been briefed about such a development and therefore not correct, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, too said it was untrue.\n\nInterestingly, those believed to be pushing for indirect primaries were said to have recently reactivated their agenda, seeing that the president had a few days more to the deadline.\n\nAccording to sources, they have reached an understanding with a section of the National Assembly leadership that they would convince the president to return the bill to them on the grounds that he wanted certain clauses amended, but that once that was done, they should file it away and not treat it till the time of the elections.\n\nAlthough the president, sources claimed, was being convinced to inform the principal officers of the National Assembly that he would withhold his assent for them to also reconsider the timing for the submission of candidates\u2019 list by political parties from 180 days to 90 days as it currently stipulated in the 2010 amended electoral act, it is a decoy to scuttle the whole process.\n\nYet, those who want the president to leave a legacy of sound and enduring electoral system, have insisted that even if he would return the bill on the grounds of a few contentious clauses, including direct primaries, he must ensure that the current effort at reforming the electoral system through many other clauses did not go to waste.\n\nCuriously, however, those in support of the president assenting to the bill as it were and also convinced he would sign it eventually, have argued that the process of returning a bill to the legislature was much longer than merely signing it hence their conviction that the president had only kept the decision to himself.\n\nAccording to a THISDAY news analysis published on Wednesday, which quoted a presidency source, \u201cYou also need to understand the process, because there is a process or if you like, protocol to these things. Remember that immediately the bill was forwarded to the president by the National Assembly, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, wrote to the president and advised against it.\n\n\u201cIt was after this that the governors took up the campaign and asked for the aspect of direct primaries to be yanked off, citing many reasons that could not fly in the face of logic. But if the president was going to listen to his AGF or give in to the pressure by the governors, the process is that he would have instructed the AGF to draft a letter of response back to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThus, if a process like that has been triggered, then you would have known that the president was not going to sign it, following the same channel of communication and as advised by his AGF. But since it was sent to him, the president has just kept quiet and knowing that signing is just about a small ceremony and solely the call of the president, so, he could choose to delay it and just sign whenever he wants for as long as it is before the deadline,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source, which cited the fact that the National Assembly would proceed on recess today, Thursday, December 16th, further contended that, \u201cIf there was going to be any communication rejecting the bill, he would have triggered the process before they embark on their recess, of which they wouldn\u2019t be back until later in January, and by which time, the process for the Ekiti and Osun States governorship elections would have begun.\n\n\u201cI mean, it belies logic that the president would write to the National Assembly after they had proceeded on recess. Therefore, if he is not writing them between now and Thursday, when they would go on recess, then, it is a deal. He will sign it, since the signing ceremony is his personal business,\u201d the source explained.\n\nBesides, the source, which equally quoted the president at a recent virtual Summit for Democracy organised by the United States President, Joe Biden, where he reiterated his commitment to leaving behind a lasting legacy of credible polls for the nation\u2019s democratic development, added that Buhari was mindful of his commitment to the diplomatic community.\n\n\u201cAs we countdown to our next general election in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government, but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner,\u201d Buhari stated at the summit.\n\nMeanwhile, a political party, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), has accused the president of failing to reciprocate the usual cordial relationship between the Executive and the present National Assembly by his refusal to assent the Electoral Act amendment bill sent to him.\n\nNational Chairman of the party, Senator Saidu Dansadau, who spoke at the end of the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Tuesday in Abuja, said the executive was not fair to the National Assembly by President Buhari\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cIf there is any president since 1999 that enjoyed maximum cooperation, it is President Muhammadu Buhari and for National Assembly to respond to the yearnings of majority of Nigerians and passed the bill as requested for by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAnd we saw on national televisions that APC governors met and said they are against the bill that would ensure free and transparent elections in the country. And they went and lobbied Mr. President to hold his assent by returning it to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cTo me, he (Buhari) is unfair to the National Assembly. He has not reciprocated their gesture as they have done to him since the past six and a half years. Also, he has not been fair to Nigerians, who voted him into power, because majority of Nigerians are interested in the passage of this bill and this is unacceptable to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI appealed to Mr. President to, in the name of God, assent to that bill without any doctoring and I also appeal to members of the National Assembly to resist any attempt by the president to tinker with what they have done,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Golu, while calling on the National Assembly to encourage Nigerians and assure them that the bill would be signed eventually, said the president has been in touch with various people from the villa regarding the bill.\n\nGolu, who spoke yesterday on the Morning Show of ARISE NEWS Television, said he believed that the National Assembly would stand its ground as they were not doing it for the president or the party but in the interest of democracy.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, you can see the level of joy and excitement. Everybody is watching and listening to what is happening everyday in regards to the the electoral reforms. There is no reason for him not to sign it. We are waiting patiently, because it\u2019s going to be a legacy as this has encouraged a lot of people to start registering in political parties.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians don\u2019t belong to any political party, because they don\u2019t participate in raising or nominating flag bearers. They only participate at the general election, where flag bearers or ticket holders are imposed on them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn direct primaries, he explained that it was dependent on whether the nation was operating a delegate system or direct primary system.\n\n\u201cWhoever is putting pressure on the president wants to achieve some personal gains but when you look at the bigger picture, I believe that four or three days should not be a problem, because he has signed bills towards the end of the minimum time frame before, so whatever happens, members of the public are there to hold their representatives accountable in case the president decides other wise, which is very unlikely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president will be ready to be embarrassed by the National Assembly at that level. The question is: did you win your elections the way it should have been won? Those who do not want it know, those who didn\u2019t want it know what they did to get to the National Assembly,\u201d Golu further stated.\n\nWhile calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) witness primary elections as provided by the current provision of the electoral act, noted that political parties contributed to maintaining these things as it was going to be a systematic process with due accreditation.\n\n\u201cI urge them not to allow partisan and I want to believe that in their own conscience, the National Assembly will not toy with what the nation has been looking up to. Nobody should be above the electoral act and constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos",

          "title": "Nigeria Boosts Police Morale with 20% Salary Increase",
          "text": "In a morale-boosting effort, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday approved a new welfare package, including a 20 per cent increase in allowances, for personnel of the Nigeria Police. Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi, disclosed this in Abuja while speaking to newsmen at the end of the weekly virtual FEC meeting at the State House, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nDingyadi said the increments would take effect from January 2022.\n\nOther packages announced by the federal government included tax waiver for junior officers with effect from October 2021 and payment of outstanding funds for uninsured personnel between 2013 and 2020.\n\nDingyadi said FEC also approved a review and upgrading of the take home pay of police personnel in Nigeria.\n\nThe pay rise came amid awful revelations and controversies in the wake of the reports and recommendations of the #EndSARS panels set up by state governments to probe the protests, which rocked the country last year.\n\nDingyadi recalled that in October 2020, Nigeria was rocked by #EndSARS protests and Mr. President addressed the country and appealed for calm. He said the president also promised a review of the remunerations of police officers to enhance their take home pay in recognition of the services they rendered to the country in terms of maintenance of peace and order.\n\nThe minister explained, \u201cWe have tried to create a situation where their take home pay will be enhanced through the increase in their allowances.\u201d\n\nDingyadi listed the police personnel allowances and approvals that were reviewed upward to include duty tour allowance, which was raised to six per cent of the new take home pay. Council also approved the payment of N1.12 billion for the settlement of outstanding benefits of personnel for the uninsured period between 2013 and 2020, which had not been covered under the group personal insurance programme.\n\nHe stated, \u201cFEC has also approved the release of N13, 127, 972, 260 (Thirteen billion, one hundred twenty seven million, nine hundred seventy two thousand, two hundred and sixty nine naira) for payment as outstanding death benefits of 5,472 personnel within the uninsured period of 2013 to August 2021, not covered under the Group Life Insurance.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also approved the payment of the sum of 1.2 billion as payment of outstanding burial expenses of personnel period of January 2012 to 2021.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also graciously approved the annual insurance premiums of 750 million naira as well as payment of Four billion, eight hundred and twelve million, five hundred thousand naira for the repairs and replacement of damaged police infrastructure in future budgets, starting from 2022.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also approved a tax waiver in the sum of eighteen billion, six hundred million for personnel, junior officers in the police, in order to increase their take home pay, this is going to take effect from October 2021.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, government has also approved the increase of the current rent subsidy, which is currently between 15 and 20 per cent, amounting to N61 billion, increase is 40 per cent of the consolidated policy salary structure (CONPOST) in the sum of seventy eight billion three hundred million naira, that is to say an increase of about sixteen billion, four hundred million naira. \u201cIt has also approved payment of an additional six per cent shift duty allowance for officers on level 01 to 14 and the supervisors allowances for officers on level 15 and above. This will come out to about ten billion and thirty million naira with effect from 2022. Most importantly, government also approved payment of about 20 per cent of CONPOST, it is peculiar allowances to boost morale, and take home pay of the Nigeria Police.\n\n\u201cThis 20 per cent is percentage of the total salary, known as peculiar allowance. It is a new allowance created to improve their take home pay.\u201d\n\nDingyadi added that all the proposed allowances and salary structure would be compiled and forwarded to the office of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) and Salary and Wages Commission for vetting and proper scrutiny\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is thereafter that the Accountant General of the Federation will be directed to approve the payment. We can see that with this development now, the police would be earning a more attractive pay that will be commensurate with what they\u2019re doing. What we expect the police to do after this is to double their efforts and justify the confidence that Mr. President and FEC have vested in them.\n\n\u201cAs a ministry we will do whatever it takes to ensure that we improve the performance and the relationship between the police and the public to ensure that they justify this good gesture.\u201d\n\nThe minister emphasised that although the proposal may not have been captured in the 2022 Appropriation Bill, it would be taken care of via a supplementary budget that would be sent later to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who was also at the media briefing, said the police wage increase was not part of the 2022 budget proposal of federal government currently before the National Assembly. Ahmed assured that the police salary increase would come into effect once the supplementary budget was approved by the legislative arm.\n\n\u201cNo, we are not talking about taking effect in January 2022. But the effective date is still January 2022. When all the problems are sorted out there will be supplementary budget sent to the parliament.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
