          "text": "The World Health Organisation on Friday declared the recently-discovered B.1.1.529 strain of Covid-19, first detected in southern Africa, to be a variant of concern and renamed it Omicron.\n\nThe classification puts Omicron into the most-troubling category of Covid-19 variants, along with the globally-dominant Delta, plus its weaker rivals Alpha, Beta and Gamma.\n\nNations rushed to ban flights to slow the spread of Omicron on Friday, while stock markets and oil prices plunged on fears surrounding the variant, potentially dealing a heavy blow to the global economic recovery.\n\n\u201cBased on the evidence presented indicative of a detrimental change in Covid-19 epidemiology\u2026 the WHO has designated B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern (VOC), named Omicron,\u201d the UN health agency said in a statement.\n\nThe WHO said it could take several weeks to complete studies of Omicron to see if there are any changes in transmissibility, severity or implications for Covid vaccines, tests and treatments.\n\nThe change in classification came after a quickly-assembled virtual meeting of the WHO\u2019s Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution.\n\nWhat you should know:\n\nThe variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on Wednesday.\n\nThe first known confirmed Omicron infection was from a specimen collected on November 9. In recent weeks, infections in South Africa have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection.\n\n\u201cThis variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,\u201d the WHO said, pointing to worrying characteristics.\n\n\u201cPreliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs.\u201d\n\nIt said the number of Omicron cases appeared to be increasing in almost all provinces of South Africa.\n\nAs for testing for the strain, the WHO added: \u201cCurrent SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Greek alphabet names \u2013\n\nAll viruses mutate over time, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19 disease.\n\nDuring late 2020, the emergence of variants that posed an increased risk to global public health prompted the WHO to start characterising them as variants of interest, and the more-worrying variants of concern, to inform the response to the pandemic.\n\nThe UN health agency decided to name the variants after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to avoid the countries that first detected them being stigmatised.\n\nThe WHO on Friday called on countries to increase their surveillance and virus sequencing efforts to better understand circulating variants.\n\nMaria Van Kerkhove, the WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19, urged people to reduce their chances of catching the virus.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people are concerned,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really important as an individual is to lower your exposure.\n\n\u201cThese proven public health measures, have never been more important,\u201d she said, citing distancing, mask-wearing, avoiding crowded spaces, good ventilation, \u201cand when it\u2019s your turn, get vaccinated\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Travel concerns \u2013\n\nApart from South Africa, Omicron has been detected in Israel in a person coming from Malawi; Botswana; Belgium and Hong Kong.\n\nDespite countries scrambling to ban flights, the WHO earlier cautioned against imposing travel restrictions due to Omicron.\n\nThe organisation said countries should take a risk-based and scientific approach when considering travel curbs in light of the variant \u2014 but cautioned against restrictions.\n\n\u201cAt this point, again, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against,\u201d spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters.\n\nBesides Delta, Omicron and the three other VOCs, there are currently two lower variants of interest and below that, a further seven under monitoring.\n\nDelta, which is more transmissible than the original strain, is now overwhelmingly dominant around the world, having all but out-competed other variants.\n\nOf 845,000 sequences uploaded to the GISAID global science initiative with specimens collected in the last 60 days, 99.8 per cent were Delta.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "\u2022 Tinubu favoured in Kano, Lagos, Borno, Katsina\n\nBy Emmanuel Aziken\n\nTwo different camps within the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC were at the weekend mounting pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to take their position on the amended Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThe pressure on Buhari according to multiple sources is majorly on the contentious provision in the amended Electoral Act that provides for direct primaries in the selection of party candidates for elections.\n\nSaturday Vanguard gathered that majority of the governors are against the provision as they feel that it denies them the godfather role of dictating candidates from their states for election. However, supporters of the 2023 presidential aspiration of National Party leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu were on their part lobbying the president to assent the bill given what they claim as his advantage using the option.\n\nSaturday Vanguard reports that Tinubu has been able to get the advantage in vote rich states like Lagos, Kano, Borno and Katsina which return the majority of votes in direct primaries.\n\nThe addition of Katsina to the vote rich states for Tinubu came after it emerged that the wife of the deputy governor of the state, Hajiya Mariya Buhari was appointed as national woman leader of the Tinubu Support Organisation, TSO.\n\nTinubu is also believed to have consolidated himself among APC members in many states controlled by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP with Akwa Ibom, Delta among such states in the South-South.\n\nThe face of the campaign for the use of direct primaries is Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila of the House of Representatives. Gbajabiamila a scion of the Tinubu camp, was one of the first senior political leaders to meet with President Buhari once he returned from his 16-day trip out of the country last week.\n\nThe Speaker who went on a mission to lobby the president on the issue came out saying that the president was supportive of direct primaries.\n\nThe pro-direct primaries camp being conscious of the leverage that the governors have in mobilizing delegates believe that the only way that they can overcome the hurdle is by going direct to the people using direct primaries to elect party candidates.\n\n\u201dThere is no way Tinubu can become APC presidential candidate with the Malami group and the governors opposed to him if indirect primaries are used,\u201d a source privy to the unfolding developments told Saturday Vanguard.\n\n\u201dThe cabal knows that there is no one with the kind of name recognition or network in the country who can match Tinubu in a direct primary and that is why they are stonewalling on the issue,\u201d the source said.\u201d\n\nSaturday Vanguard gathered that it was part of their strategy to lessen the momentum of Tinubu that they have been stonewalling on the national convention of the party. The opposition to Tinubu in the Tinubu camp as represented by the governors of Yobe, Kebbi and Jigawa, respectively, Mai Mala Buni, Senator Atiku Bagudu and Mohammed Abubakar.\n\nThe three governors after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari last Monday announced that the party\u2019s convention will hold next February and by that extend the time that Buni has held on as caretaker committee chairman of the party.\n\nIn that period the governors working with the cabal are expected to push proposals that would further diminish the leverage Tinubu has.\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari is said to be walking between the devil and the deep blue sea on the matter of direct primaries as he could face a popular rebellion in the National Assembly over the matter.\n\nBesides the strong support for Tinubu from Speaker Gbajabiamila and Senate President Ahmad Lawan, the majority of National Assembly members are also craving for direct primaries.\n\nThe lawmakers believe that it is the only way that they can be liberated from the apron strings of their governors who dictate candidates list when indirect methods are used for primaries.\n\n\u201dIf the president refuses to sign the lawmakers are ready to override the veto for their self-preservation,\u201d one source told Saturday Vanguard.\n\nBesides, there are also some regional champions who are also said to be pushing the agenda that the use of direct primaries would give the North an advantage in the selection of presidential candidates on the basis of the alleged superiority of the region in population.\n\nSaturday Vanguard reports that the National Assembly in passing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, had provided that the selection of candidates should be by direct primaries. The extant Electoral Act on the other hand provides for the use of direct, indirect or consensus.\n\nThe shocker for the Anti-Tinubu forces came when on the last day of the consideration of the bill that Speaker Gbajabiamila during the Committee of the Whole with the deputy Speaker Idris Wase presiding as required by the rules of the House, moved the motion for the adoption of the compulsory use of direct primaries for selection of candidates.\n\nThe moment Gbajabiamila moved the motion, the majority of the House was forced to support it leading to the harmonization in the same direction with the Senate.\n\nHowever, sources within the party say that Gbajabiamila was pandering to the interest of his political godfather who holds sway among the party grassroots.\n\nIt would be recalled that a major offensive to stop Tinubu came with the removal of Adams Oshiomhole as national chairman of the party in 2020 following claims of the latter\u2019s allegiance to Tinubu. Since then repeated efforts to elect a new executive has not materialized on account of the inability of the forces against Tinubu to drown him.\n\nHowever, one activist in the anti-Tinubu camp was dismissive of the national leader\u2019s advantage in a direct primary.\n\n\u201dAfter Lagos, Kano, Osun and maybe Borno where else is he strong? Mark me, Tinubu will not contest the APC presidential primary,\u201d the source said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

In order to fortify their positions which, perhaps, they did not merit.\u201d\n\nHowever, in his reaction to the declaration of bandits as terrorists, Brigadier General Idris Bello(rtd) wondered how a court assumed the role and responsibility of the Federal Government.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely of no consequence because it\u2019s the purview of only the Executive and the Legislative arms of government and not that of the Judiciary.\u201d\n\nKaduna-Abuja Road of hell\n\nAlso, former Executive Secretary of the NHIS, Prof. Usman Yusuf, said the Kaduna-Abuja Road had become a highway to hell.\n\nHe said in an interview that \u201cthey have not been able to secure this highway in the last six years.\n\n\u201cA nation that has a standing military and a standing police force cannot secure a highway of 166 kilometres.\n\n\u201cWe should do better. We are not doing as we need to do. These hundreds of female soldiers that were brought with all the funfare, where are they?\n\n\u201cWe must do better. There are three main villages along that place that are troublesome\u2014Jere, Katari and Rijana.\n\n\u201cYou mean we cannot dominate these places? Do we not see our security forces dominate Anambra State for their election?\n\n\u201cSo protecting the ballot box is more important than protecting people?\n\n\u201cSo government needs to do more. It\u2019s not doing as it needs to do.\n\n\u201cBanditry is a social problem. There is a role for the military, there is no military solution to this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018We need special forces\u2019\n\nOn his part, former Presidential candidate and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, said Nigeria should\u2019ve developed the capacity of her special forces to be able to rescue people who are abducted with minimum casualty and apprehend the perpetrators.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo this is to complement this bombardment that you\u2019re seeing and all that.\n\n\u201cThose are kinetic action. But you also need some police action where those people who do this kind of things can be identified in communities and punished adequately.\n\n\u201cOnce kidnappers see that when they kidnap you don\u2019t have to pay ransom because people get released, there would be no incentives for their kidnapping.\n\n\u201cThis would reduce, progressively. So it\u2019s very important for us to have our special forces trained.\n\n\u201cThis is something I believe should be on the front burner for government.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

These are; the wound should not be cut open, the venom also should not be sucked out of the wound.\n\n\u201cA tourniquet, ice or water should not be put on the snake bite area, magic stone should not be applied on the wound and alcohol, beverages or any other medications should not be administered to a snake bite victim.\n\n\u201cThe only medication that can work when such occurs is an antivenom administration in a government or certified private health facility.\u201d\n\nOmoteemi who warned that a bite from a poisonous snake is dangerous explained that on most occasions, it may be hard to know whether the snake that bit someone is poisonous or not, especially if the snake has not been found.\n\n\u201cNot all snakes are poisonous. But snakes like the black mamba, timber rattlesnake, and copperhead are extremely poisonous and can make someone collapse within 45 minutes.\u201d\n\nRecall that recently a Nigerian Airforce personnel, Lance Corporal Ogah Bercy died in Abuja as a result of complications from a snake bite.\n\nAccording to reports, she was bitten by a snake in her toilet at the Airforce Base, Clinton Drive, Abuja.\n\nShe reportedly died because an antivenom was not administered to her on time.",

Emmanuel Chukwuma has advised religious leaders to consider making the possession of permanent voters cards (PVCs) a pre-condition for conducting their parishioners\u2019 weddings and burials.\n\nChukwuma added that he would, however, not encourage fellow bishops to deny their members Holy Communion for not presenting PVCs because it is \u201ca means of grace.\u201d\n\nThe cleric spoke during a press conference to herald the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Enugu Anglican Diocese weekend in Enugu.\n\nHe said the stringent measure may be necessary to show how important the PVC is in the selection of who leads the nation and various states in 2023.\n\nHe urged politicians to promote politics without bitterness and to deepen democracy by making people\u2019s votes count.\n\nHis words: \u201cPolitics without bitterness is what we want. Therefore, we\u2019re saying that for that to be deepened, people\u2019s votes must be counted.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we\u2019re encouraging all our members to go and register for permanent voters cards (PVC) and have your voters card.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like some bishops who said no PVC, no Holy Communion. No. Holy Communion is a means of grace. It\u2019s important. There are other ways you can sanction.\n\n\u201cI can say, \u2018okay, if you don\u2019t have your PVCs, your weddings and burials will not be conducted.\u2019 It has reached that extent. So, people should go and register and have their PVCs\u201d.\n\nThe Archbishop lamented that Southeasterners seemed not to be taking the registration for PVCs seriously, saying such attitude was already keeping themselves backwards.\n\n\u201cThe people in the Southeast, we are really negatively dealing with ourselves by not registering. These things can even be used for population. The Southeast should not shortchange itself by not registering. Once you are up to 18 years and above, you should go and register. The church is much concerned about this so that during 2023 elections, we will be able to have our say\u201d, Chukwuma said.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary celebration of the diocese, the prelate said the Enugu Anglican Diocese became 50 in August last year, having been created in August 1970 with Rt. Rev. Gideon Nweke Otubele as its first bishop.\n\n\u201cWe mapped out robust programmes to celebrate 50 years of Enugu Diocese but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we shifted it to this year.\n\n\u201cWe have started the programme with a crusade which is going to last till Sunday next week. The programmes, including rallies, talks, and visitations will end with a thanksgiving service on the 5th of December at the Cathedral of Good Shepherd, Enugu\u201d he said.\n\nOther activities, he said, would be the commissioning of a diagnostic centre of the church\u2019s Hospital, the Good Shepherd Hospital\n\nThe Enugu Diocese, he noted, had since its creation, given birth to eleven other dioceses\n\nThe diocese, he added, is out to execute pragmatic evangelism; care for the poor, the widows and orphans, the less privileged and the displaced.",

The anti-graft agency first arraigned the duo before Justice Daniel Longji on 17 counts bordering on criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of public money in March 2015.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nHowever, after Justice Longji retired in December 2019 after hearing the matter for 34 times, the state Chief Judge, Justice Yakubu Dakwak reassigned the case to Justice Christie Dabup who started hearing on the matter afresh. Since the re-arraignment of the former governor, the court had not made any meaningful progress with the case due to stalled proceedings occasioned mostly by the absence of the prosecution until Thursday when the Lead Prosecution Counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) sought the order of the court for a new judge to take over the case. Moving the application for the reassignment of the case, the EFCC counsel told the court that the national lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 as well as the recent national strike by judiciary workers had prevented the case from being heard expeditiously . He also argued that given the fresh commencement of the case due to the retirement of the former judge handling the matter, there was the need to avoid wastage like in the first trial especially as the current trial judge might not be able to conclude the case before her own retirement. But counsel to Jang, Edward Pwajok (SAN) opposed the EFCC application, arguing that the anti-graft agency was only a party to the case and therefore could not determine how the court manages its affairs. Pwajok insisted that the court would be able to dispose the rest of the case in good time if the EFCC is serious with the prosecution.\n\nCounsel to the second defendant, SO Oyewale also opposed the EFCC application and urged the court to continue with the case or strike it out for lack of diligent prosecution. After listening to the argument by both parties, Justice Christie Dabup, in her ruling, said since there was no other court designated yet to handle such criminal matters, it would be absurd for her to recuse herself from the case. She therefore ordered the EFCC to go ahead with the presentation of more witnesses to enable the court make progress in the case.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje, Vivian Onyebukwa, Oyinlola Pelumi Adewale (Lagos) Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki); Timothy Olanrewaju (Maiduguri); Obinna Odogwu (Awka); Jude Chinedu, (Enugu); Sylvanus Viashima (Jalingo); Rose Ejembi (Makurdi); Tony John (Port Harcourt) and Oluseye Ojo (Ibadan).\n\nDon\u2019t ever try it! Don\u2019t even contemplate it! That\u2019s the message that Nigerians from all walks of life across the country are sending to the Federal Government on its proposed increase of fuel pump price from its present price to N340 per litre, as from next year. They include civil servants, the self-employed, unemployed, civil rights advocacy groups, lawmakers and political pressure groups, from Lagos to Lafia, Port Harcourt to Potiskum, Jalingo to Jamare, Maiduguri to Makurdi, Abakiliki to Abak and Ibadan to Bida.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nWhile expressing its view on the matter, Afenifere, the Pan-Yoruba group, through its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, warned that the plan, if implemented, could plunge the country into social, economic and industrial crises whose outcome nobody can predict. Noting that the fuel subsidy has been a mantra used by the political elite to siphon state funds into private pockets in the past, he wondered why the Federal Government couldn\u2019t wait for the refineries to come on stream before removing the so-called petroleum subsidy.\n\nAuwal Musa Rafsanjani, Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) said the proposed fuel price increase exposes the policy inconsistencies, somersaults, as well as lack of honesty and transparency on the part of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) Federal Government. The activist, who is also Chairman Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) picked holes in the proposed N5, 000 monthly palliative to 40 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIf you calculate the N5, 000 to be given to each of 40 million Nigerians, you will see that there is a huge inconsistency in it. If you replace fuel subsidy with N5, 000 to 40 million, it will give you N200 billion monthly and N2.4 trillion annually, which is higher than the N1.8 trillion the government claims is the fuel subsidy. So how can the government replace N1.8 trillion with N2.4 trillion if they are honest?.\u201d\n\nVice Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Ebonyi State Council, Mr. Benjamin Nworie, berated the Federal Government for being insensitive to the plight of poor Nigerians, and called on Nigerians to stand up and resist the hike when and if it is eventually implemented.\n\nFormer Deputy Chief Whip of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Nze Tony-Uche Ezekwelu, said that while he is in support of allowing the market forces to determine the prices of petroleum products, he is wondering how the Federal Government arrived at N340 per litre. His words: \u201cIf you calculate everything, including the gain, the petroleum production will sell at about N287 at the petrol station with between N16 and N25 gain per litre. So, how they arrived at N340, I don\u2019t really know. When the fuel pump price increased to N87 per litre, at the time of Goodluck Jonathan administration, the opposition party led by Tinubu and Buhari called the subsidy fund a fraud. They said that if they\u2019re voted into power, they would revert the fuel price to N45 per litre. To me, the issue of subsidy is a fraud. As far as I am concerned, there is actually little or no subsidy for fuel in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCharles Okeke, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Tshabron, and MTN Connect warned that increasing fuel pump price to such astronomical height will see life coming to a halt for majority of Nigerians. \u201cI don\u2019t see how Nigeria will survive except the people that are in the corridors of power, like the governors who are all supporting this for whatever reason they think.\u201d He also pooh-poohed the idea of giving N5, 000 to 40 million Nigerians, calling it a political gimmick. \u201cIf they are going to implement it, it will be the worst policy that a government had ever made. Everything will just crumble,\u201d he said. Roseleen Folarin, a Reel Estate developer believes that doing so will be the height of wickedness and insensitivity any government can unleash on its already suffering people.\n\nYunusa Abdullahi, an office assistant, and Hajiya Halima Mohammed, a widow and a schoolteacher, both based in Maiduguri, Borno State, noted that increasing the prices of fuel will only increase the present economic suffering and hardship that almost everybody is passing through. Ejike Nnamani, Enugu-based commercial driver noted that it will be like pouring fuel on a burning fire, in a situation where everybody is crying over the increase in the prices of gas, foodstuffs and public electric power tariff. A civil servant and resident, Onyema Amujiri, asked: \u201cHow will salary earners like us cope? The N5000 they said they\u2019ll pay some people is just a joke taken too far. How are they going to achieve that and even if they do, what effect will it have? Will the money be enough to ameliorate the suffering of the people? How much is N5000? What can it buy in the market? What problem can it solve? As I am talking to you now, I\u2019m angry. That\u2019s why I always avoid talking about anything that has to do with this country. Our leaders are just too insensitive.\u201d\n\nBishop Nath Ofor, General Overseer, Jesus Campaigners Ministry sees the proposed sharing of N5, 000 as nonsensical. \u201cWhat can 5,000 do in a life of an individual?,\u201d he asked. Gabriel Yough, a civil servant, warned the government to expect possible backlash if they try it.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t push the people to the wall and expect them not to turn back and do something rash. We should learn from the palliative experience during the ENDSARS protest that Nigerians can be very angry and reactive.\u201d Sarah Danjuma, a trader and dealer in grains called on government to think of the worsening impact it is going to have on Nigerians in the face of increases in house rent, electricity tariff, school fees, charcoal, gas and food prices. \u201cIf you increase the fuel price, it means that every other item will double their price,\u201d she said. \u201cA bag of maize will end up selling for over N30, 000.\u201d\n\nChairman, Human Rights Defenders, Ebonyi State Chapter, Mr. Sampson Nweke described the move as harsh and oppressive, adding that doing that will amount to an overkill in the light of the increasing cost of food items and cooking gas. \u201cAny increment will be resisted because it\u2019s anti-people and unacceptable,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe Federal Government should not add to the anger of its mis-governance.\u201d\n\nMr. Livingstone Wechie, a prominent social crusader and public analyst and Solomon Lenu, spokesman for Civil Society Organisations in Rivers State, expressed similar view. Wechie believes that \u201cthe N5, 000 announced by the Federal Government comes as a huge distraction and too unrealistic to serve a palliative for Nigeria. Under what economic indices and data are they paying Nigerians? Lenu, in his view, sees it as an insult and vows to resist it. He declared: \u201cWe, members of the civil society will resist this injustice (fuel hike). We won\u2019t accept it.\u201d\n\nTagher Ushahemba, a driver and Tina Nyiyongo, a self-employed person believe that increasing the fuel price to N340 per litre will turn their worlds upside down.\n\nWhile Ushahemba insists that it is not \u201ceven an option that should be considered at all by any responsible government,\u201d Nyiyongo fears that \u201cprices of other commodities including foodstuffs will also increase.\u201d Dr Ahmed Sanusi, a retired lecturer, from Bauchi State University, warned with a voice laden with anger: \u201cwe are about to enter an unbearable situation where you will need four or five other sources of income to survive. May God help us.\u201d Kevin Umeh, a lawyer, foresees a situation where, from next year onward, living will no longer be a matter of survival but survival of the fittest. Ayomide Mayowa, an Uber driver who has been in the business for about three years said although there had been increases in the prices of fuel in the past, this one, N340 per litre, will be the mother of them all. \u201cWhat are we Uber drivers meant to do? How do we survive after each ride?,\u201d he asked before adding: \u201cPeople will soon toss Uber aside and start jumping into buses because they might not be able to afford our fares again.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze and George Onyejiuwa, Owerri\n\nThere was a harvest of tributes in celebration of Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu at the 10th edition of the memorial of the late Igbo hero, in Owerri, Imo State, yesterday.\n\nThe event took place at the expansive grounds of the Ojukwu Memorial Library built by the leader of BIM-MASSOB, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThis is as Ojukwu\u2019s wife, Bianca, declared at the event that the clamour for secession, which according to her, had reached fever pitch in the country today, was a direct consequence of the inequities of the Nigerian state as presently constituted.\n\nShe maintained that the Igbo have continued to feel the pains of marginalization and exclusion on a daily basis, adding that for as long as this was not addressed, and in so far as the Federal Government continued to exclude the South East from certain political positions and critical development projects such as the National Railway plan, and the zone continued to suffer the ravages of the deteriorating conditions of existing federal infrastructure, most especially roads, the feelings of collective victimization can only be reinforced and will continue to sustain the agitations for a separate state.\n\nThe former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain decried the continued detention of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, and called on the Federal Government to consider the pleas for his release.\n\nThanking the Igbo leaders who visited President Muhammadu Buhari recently in pursuance of this objective, she appealed to the president to consider the calibre and age of these Igbo statesmen and grant their request in order to demonstrate a genuine commitment to healing the wounds of the past.\n\nShe regretted that the Igbo have been continually denied equal sense of belonging and legitimate citizenship rights in Nigeria. She, however, noted that no sacrifice was too much to promote and sustain a peaceful coexistence of all the ethnic nationalities in the country.\n\nDeputy governor of Anambra State, Dr Nkem Okeke, who was special guest at the event, said for the Igbo to get what they want as a people, they must act with unity of purpose.\n\nHe said that the Igbo as a great nation must begin to speak with one voice if they must achieve their aspirations in an ethnic country like Nigeria as according to him, without unity they will continue to lose their rightful place in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNdigbo are a great people, but they are divided and I am saying this because we need unity and without it, we cannot achieve anything. But with unity, we can achieve whatever we set our minds on. We must stand together and if we don\u2019t do that, we will never get our rights or political aims. So, we must unite and stand together for our rights,\u201d Okeke said.\n\nThe deputy governor added: \u201cOjukwu, while alive, stood for the unity of Ndigbo and was a man of integrity and we are here today to honour his memorial. And the only way Ndigbo can continue to honour the memory of this great man who sacrificed his personal wealth and comfort for the cause of Ndigbo is to be united and continue to speak with one voice.\u201d\n\nHe also lauded the leader of BIM-MASSOB, Uwazuruike for organising the annual Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu Day in memory of the late Igbo sage.\n\nIn his remarks, son of the late Biafra leader, Afamefuna Ojukwu, a young United States-trained engineer, also thanked Uwazuruike for consistently hosting the event every year since the demise of his father.\n\nThe event was a cultural festival, featuring a brief interdenominational service, traditional dances and masquerade display, colourful parades, drama sketches and a live band eulogizing in music, the exploits of the Biafra hero.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "Sustains measures to boost output growth next year\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Friday said it would establish an International Financial Centre (IFC) at the Eko Atlantic City by the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe apex bank said the centre would among other things serve investors seeking to invest in critical sectors of the economy.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, announced this at the 56th Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) Annual Bankers Dinner in Lagos.\n\nHe also said stressed that the proposed centre would serve as a gateway for funds and investments into the country adding that it will be driven by technology and payment system infrastructure.\n\nHe identified lack of access to large pools of cheap investment capital as a key constraint to supporting growth in critical sectors of the Nigerian economy, pointing out that the IFC will seek to address this challenge.\n\nEmefiele, in his address to the August gathering said, \u201cToday over $100 trillion is held by institutional investors in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, most of it invested in low-yielding assets relative to high-yielding opportunities in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWorking to tap into this pool of funds will require the set-up of an investment framework that offers comfort and security to investors seeking to invest in critical sectors of our economy.\u201d\n\nHe said,\u201cIn this regard, the Central Bank of Nigeria is working to set up an International Financial Center at the Eko Atlantic City in Lagos that will serve as a hub for attracting domestic and external capital which is needed to strengthen our post-COVID economy.\n\n\u201cThe International Finance Center, when fully operational in the 2nd quarter of 2022, will help to position Nigeria as a key destination for investment in Africa.\u2019\u2019\n\nEmefiele had in September hinted that the Nigerian International Financial Centre (NIFC) which will act as an international gateway for capital and investments, driven by technology and payment system infrastructure, would be established within the next 12 months.\n\nThe said NIFC, which he termed the new financial hub, would consolidate on the growth and resilience of Nigerian banks and will curate local and international banks to make them global champions.\n\nHe further explained that the NIFC will be a 24/7 financial centre that will complement London, New York and Singapore financial centers and enable an acceleration of home grown initiatives including the Infracorp plc.\n\nHe added that the NIFC will also complement initiatives on the Nigerian Commodity Exchange and the National Theatre creative hubs for youths as well as the e-naira project which also debuted in October.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the NIFC will take advantage of existing laws particularly the BOFIA 2020, Nigerian Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA) and other CBN regulations to create a fully global investment and financial hub where monies, ideas, and technology will move freely without hindrance.\n\nEmefiele also said that about $500 million had been invested in indigenous payment systems companies between 2015 and 2020 adding that the platform had continued to evolve towards meeting the needs of households and businesses in the country.\n\nNevertheless, the apex bank boss said despite the various progress recorded in the banking and financial sector, about 36 per cent of the adult population currently lacked access to financial services in the country.\n\nHe said that improving access to finance for individuals and businesses through digital channels could help to improve financial inclusion, lower the cost of transactions, and increase the flow of credit to businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, on the CBN\u2019s policy focus for 2022, Emefiele said the continued implementation of intervention efforts by the bank would sustain the recovery efforts and stimulate further growth of the economy.\n\nHe noted that notwithstanding the positive indicators so far recorded as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19, growth had remained fragile, as unemployment and inflation rate remained at levels that were not supportive of growth.\n\nHe said given population growth at about 2.7 per cent annually, it is important to continue to deploy measures that will enable the economy to attain annual growth rates of over 5 per cent.\n\nThe CBN governor said,\u201dThrough the pandemic we are aware that our policy responses are often more effective when we work with the private sector.\n\n\u201cFor example, the CACOVID alliance played an instrumental role in reducing the negative effects of the pandemic, by providing palliative support to families affected by the virus and in rebuilding our healthcare institutions.\u201d\n\nHe said leveraging the strength of the private sector will be critical in mobilising funds that are needed toward building a more resilient and stronger economy.\n\nHe said the apex bank would strengthen collaborations with the private sector in order to support investments in critical sectors such as infrastructure, and ICT, in addition to ongoing efforts to build a stronger agriculture and manufacturing base in the country.\n\nEmefiele said:\u201dAs a result, all efforts in 2022 must be made to ensure that we maintain our focus on improving access to finance and credit for households and businesses, mobilizing investment to boost domestic productivity, enabling faster growth of non-oil exports, and supporting employment generating activities.\u201d\n\nHe said that in an effort to implement policies that would engender growth and employment, the CBN recently unveiled the 100 for 100 policy on production and productivity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cEligible firms must show evidence of their efforts to harness available local raw materials towards the realization of their intended investment.\n\n\u201cEfforts will also be made to support firms that are geared towards producing goods for the export market. The Central Bank of Nigeria is committed to supporting eligible firms with foreign exchange to import machineries and equipment.\n\n\u201d Let me add that routine audits will be conducted on firms that receive funding, to ensure that they are complying with the terms of the program. We believe this programme will significantly help to catalyze growth in critical sectors of our economy, while aiding our efforts to create employment opportunities and reduce our dependence on imported goods.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Malami: Judgement will embolden Nigerian government to crush bandits\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nA Federal High Court in Abuja under trial Justice Taiwo Taiwo has ruled that activities of bandits, as well as other similar groups, by whatever names they are called, in any part of the country, amounted to acts of terrorism and subsequently declared them terrorists.\n\nJustice Taiwo further held that the federal government must publish the order in the official Gazette and two national dailies in the country.\n\nReacting to the ruling, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami said it would now embolden the federal government to go all out to crush all forms of banditry in the country.\n\nThe order declaring bandits terrorists was sequel to an application filed on behalf of the federal government by the Director of Public Prosecution, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, regarding the activities of Yan Bindiga, Yan Ta\u2019adda and other groups of bandits in the country.\n\nIn the exparte application, the federal government had prayed the court to outlaw the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other terrorist groups in the country.\n\nThe request, according to the federal government in a supporting affidavit, was to checkmate the activities of the group, which the government claimed were responsible for killings, abductions, rapes, kidnappings, and other criminal acts in the North-east, North-central, and other parts of the country.\n\nThe federal government blamed the groups for \u201cbanditry, incessant kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, and other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters, and wanton destruction of lives and proper property.\u201d\n\nIt went on to say that the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, were responsible for the deaths of soldiers, police officers, and other security agents across the country.\n\nCommercial, educational, and farming activities in the North-west and North-central have been disrupted as a result of the groups\u2019 activities, the federal government said.\n\n\u201cThe activities of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, constitute acts of terrorism that can lead to a breakdown of public order and safety, as well as a threat to Nigeria\u2019s national security and corporate existence,\u201d the FG said in the supporting affidavit.\n\nThe DPP said President Muhammadu Buhari gave approval for his action, which objective is the proscription of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups and other terrorist groups in the country.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nSpecifically, the court declared the activities of the \u201cYan Bindiga Group\u201d and the \u201cYan Ta\u2019adda Group,\u201d as well as other similar groups, in any part of the country, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones, to be \u201cacts of terrorism and illegality.\u201d\n\nThe judge ruled that \u201csimilar groups, either in groups or as individuals by whatever names they are called, in any part of Nigeria, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones\u201d are terrorists and banned.\u201d\n\nJustice Taiwo said in the light of the nefarious activities of bandits and their effects on the people and the nation\u2019s economy, he was convinced that such orders were required.\n\nHe extended the proscription order to all other groups in the country, regardless of their names, whose activities and goals are similar to those of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups.\n\nAccording to the ruling, terror activities \u201cinclude, but not limited to banditry, kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters and wanton destruction of lives and properties in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe judge held further that the federal government must publish the prosecution order in the official Gazette and two national dailies in the country.\n\nFG Welcomes Ruling\n\nThe federal government has welcomed the declaration of Justice Taiwo and said it would go ahead to gazette the proscription order in line with the ruling of the court.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Malami said it would now embolden the federal government to go all out to crush all forms of banditry in the country.\n\nMalami said the declaration \u201cis a demonstration of this administration\u2019s determination to do things in accordance with the rule of law.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe development is a pointer to the commitment of the federal government to adhere to the international standards in respecting the rules of engagement in the fight against terrorism, separatist organisations, insurgency and banditry in the country.\u201d\n\nHe said by this declaration, the Federal Government of Nigeria has taken a bold step to deal ruthlessly with all terrorists groups and their sponsors in efforts to bring lasting solution to the myriad of security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice in collaboration with relevant government agencies, including security operatives are working assiduously to do the needful to take full advantage of this declaration.\n\n\u201cThe government will gazette, publish the proscription order,\u201d Malami

          "text": "*Kidnappers demand N99m ransom for 66 abducted Kaduna Baptist Church members\n\nSeriki Adinoyi in Jos and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nNo fewer than 11 persons, including children, were killed yesterday and 30 houses burnt when terrorists attacked Te\u2019egbe community in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State.\n\nIn a swift reaction, Governor Simon Lalong expressed anger over the attack, describing it as \u201canother sad incident\u201d aimed at destabilising the state.\n\nOn the same day, it emerged that the abductors of 66 members of Baptist Church, Kakau Daji, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State, finally contacted families of the victims after 27 days, with a demand for N99 million ransom.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the assailants raided Te\u2019egbe village in the early hours of yesterday while the villagers were still asleep, killing 11 persons and injuring several others, and also setting ablaze several houses.\n\nSpokesman for the Miango Youth Development Association, Mr. Nuhu Bitrus, while confirming the attack said, \u201cLast night was very horrible for the Irigwe nation as Fulani militia attacked Te\u2019egbe village, killed so many persons and injured many others. They also set their houses on fire.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have just counted the bodies of 10 persons who were shot dead by the attackers. They are being taken to the mortuary. Our people are still searching for more victims. We will let you know when we are done with the search and rescue operation.\u201d\n\nAlso lamenting, the Secretary of Irigwe Development Association (IDA), Mr. Danjuma Auta said, \u201cJust last week, we read on social media the threat chats sent by Fulani herders to the military stationed at Ancha, a neighbouring community, asking them to allow free grazing in and around all communities in Irigwe land or be made to face their wrath.\n\n\u201cAlthough the military dismissed the threat, Fulani have carried out their plans as they attacked Ancha village on Tuesday, 23th November, 2021 and killed two persons.\n\n\u201cAgain, these same Fulani herders attacked the village of Ta\u2019agbe and, as of now, we have already confirmed the death of 11 people, while the search is still ongoing. We are worried because times without number, we have met at different fora with the Fulani community that we know and have promised to embrace peace, but with the renewed attacks on our innocent citizens we wonder if the peace accord entered is anything to hold to.\n\n\u201cIf those who\u2019re saddled with the constitutional responsibility of protecting us feel overwhelmed and can no longer guarantee our safety, they should come out publicly and tell Nigerians. Our people are beginning to lose confidence in any security agent since their presence could not stop, arrest, or neutralise the attackers.\u201d\n\nLalong Mourns\n\nMeanwhile, Lalong said the attack yesterday remained condemnable and unacceptable to the government.\n\nIn a statement by his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Macham Makut, the governor described the attack as \u201canother sad incident which is clearly the handiwork of criminals that are bent on instilling fear, pain and sorrow among the people with a view to destabilising the state and making fortune from their criminality, as well as rupturing the substantial peace attained.\u201d\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cThe Governor totally condemns the attack and says there is no explanation that can justify it. He therefore directs security agencies to take immediate and drastic steps to apprehend the perpetrators and ensure that they pay for their crimes.\n\nIt further quoted the Governor as saying \u201cThe persistent attacks in this general area remain condemnable and unacceptable to Government. As such, no resources and efforts will be spared in painstakingly following up on the trail of those who derive joy in attacking and killing innocent citizens and destroying their homes and means of livelihoods.\n\n\u201cI expect the security agencies to deploy everything at their disposal to arrest those who carried out the crime no matter how long it takes. Government will not take any excuse for failure to achieve this directive.\u201d\n\nLalong while commiserating with the victims and families of those killed, assured that they would get justice as Government will stop at nothing to unravel those behind this ugly incidences that continue to disrupt the livelihoods of the people of the local government.\n\nLalong also directed the Plateau State Emergency Management Agency and the Peace Building Agency to immediately visit the area and assess the level of damage with a view to carrying out immediate intervention and bringing succour to people who are in need as a result of the barbaric attack.\n\nHe also called on the people to assist the security agencies with relevant information that would enable them crack the identity of the attackers and know their motives.\n\nPlateau State Police Confirm Killings\n\nThe Plateau State Police Command has confirmed the attack at Te\u2019egbe Community.\n\nIn a statement issued by its Spokesman, Ubah Ogaba, the Police Command said, \u201cOn 26/11/2021 at about 0130hrs, the Command received a report of an attack by yet to be identified gunmen at Te\u2019egbe Village of Bassa LGA of the state.\n\n\u201cUpon receipt of the report, the Commissioner of Police, Plateau State Command, Bartholomew Onyeka, immediately drafted a tactical team of the Command to the scene to avert further attack.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police further led other Senior Officers of the Command to the scene for an on-the-spot assessment and to console the victims of the attack.\n\n\u201cThe CP has directed that discreet investigation be carried out and assured the community of his readiness to fish out the perpetrators of this barbaric act.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indigenous natives of the attacked community, the Irigwe ethnic nationality, have expressed disappointment with the security agents who they accused of failing to protect the people despite having prior knowledge of the attack.\n\nThe statement further pleaded with the President Muhammadu Buhari to come to their rescue before it is too late, adding that security operatives \u201cmust be made to quickly investigate Fulani settlements fingered to be hosting and training these attackers.\u201d\n\nTerrorists Demand N99m Ransom for Release of 66 Abducted Baptist Church Members\n\nAbductors of 66 members of Baptist Church, Kakau Daji, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State are demanding N99 million ransom for their release.\n\nThe Vice Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 Northern States and Abuja, Rev. John Hayab, disclosed this yesterday in an interview with journalists in Kaduna.\n\nThis is the first time the abductors will be making contact with the families of victims, 27 days after the abduction.\n\nThe worshipers were abducted on October 31, 2021, when the terrorists invaded the church during Sunday service.\n\nThe terrorists were said to have taken five of the victims close to the community and shot three dead while two others had gunshots wounds and were taken to the hospital.\n\nHayab also said one of the remaining four students of Bethel Baptist High School, Damishi, Kaduna, who were abducted on July 5, 2021, had been released, while three were still being held by the bandits.\n\nHe said N5 million was paid to the terrorists for the release of the student. The bandits had on July 5, invaded the school and abducted 121 students. A total of 117 of the students were later released while others escaped.\n\nSources said over N200 million was paid to the bandits for the freedom of the students who were released in four batches. Ransom was said to have been paid for each batch.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Celebrates Presidential Library\u2019s 2MW solar power project\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday demanded that Nigeria must commit to generating power from renewable energy and clean carbon-free sources, in order to build a future for the country.\n\nHe stated this during the inauguration of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library\u2019s 2MW solar power project in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\n\nObasanjo said renewable energy \u201cis cheaper and good for the environment.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cToday, I am speaking to you in a facility powered by the sun \u2013 solar energy. It is the way of a future (Jimmy) Carter envisioned all those years ago. It will help build the future we want. The Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library solar power project is a reflection of our commitment to clean and renewable energy and is the single largest investment this not-for-profit organisation has made.\n\n\u201cAs large an investment as it is, it is remarkably cost effective. It costs less than two and half years supply of diesel to power our generators. So, in diesel terms, it pays for itself in less than three years. So in effect, the electricity it produces after three years is almost at no cost.\n\n\u201cIn addition, because it is not emitting any greenhouse gases that diesel generators do, it has the potential to earn carbon credits which are currently priced at US$40/ton.\n\n\u201cBased on estimated annual production of 2,307,000 kilo Watt hours per year, we can expect to earn nearly US$39,589 in carbon credits per year.\n\n\u201cBy monetising this facility with strategic sponsorships and marketing alliances, we will be able to generate revenue.\n\n\u201cCombined, this solar facility can generate electricity, generate revenues that contribute to the upkeep of the library, help save the planet making a small contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation, provide shade for parking, and be an inspiration for future generations. Who says you can\u2019t make a profit out of saving the planet?\u201d\n\nObasanjo, 84, said he \u201cis a responsible steward for nature,\u201d adding, \u201cthe facility marks one of the enduring personal legacies I am proud to call my own.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the former president said, \u201cThe recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) was attended by over 1,000 universities from 68 countries, who witnessed powerful speeches and renewed commitments to reach Net Zero emissions by 2050, in some cases 2060 and in Nigeria\u2019s case 2070.\n\n\u201cThis is the best time for all Nigerian universities to sign-up to the United Nations\u2019 Race to Zero campaign, and commit to reducing their carbon emissions to zero by 2050 at the latest.\n\n\u201cWe hope that by committing to consume renewable energy we inspire others to follow and still inform others to do their bit for the environment. Our great nation also needs to commit to producing our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon-free sources. This goal is achievable, affordable and transformative. It represents a challenge to all Nigerians \u2013 in every walk of life, to our political leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators, engineers, and to every citizen.\n\n\u201cThis is a generational moment. I\u2019m asking each of you to join me and build this future. Our success depends on our willingness as a people to undertake this journey. We have a duty of care for the planet and for every person upon it. We must fulfill it by making our energy system clean, efficient, affordable and sustainable.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held.

          "title": "Nigerian fintech startup, FairMoney, hosts its first \u201cInvestor Conference\u201d",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 has been a good year for African startups. This year, the continent has already minted five unicorns. After the lull in investment activities in 2020, investments in African startups are on track to exceed the $2 billion record set in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, the bulk of the funding has gone to fintech startups with the fragmented nature of the continent\u2019s financial system providing an opportunity for innovative founders and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurin Hainy, CEO and Co-Founder of FairMoney\n\nAs of October 2021, Africa: The Big Deal reported that 57% of the amounts raised which was slightly above $1.6 billion has gone to fintech startups. One such fintech is FairMoney, a digital bank that currently offers lending services in Nigeria, India, and France.\n\nIn July, the startup raised a $42 million Series B led by Tiger Global to consolidate its position in India and Nigeria. This follows its $10 million Series A round raised in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, November 18, 2021, the company hosted investors, the media, and industry leaders at its first investor conference. Following a brief introduction, the CEO and co-founder, Laurin Hainy took to the stage to share the startup\u2019s journey since inception.\n\nIn his welcome address, Hainy revealed that the conference was \u201cconceived to provide an avenue for capital market operators, investors, fintech players, regulators, industry associations, and other financial industry participants to discuss the role of digital financial models in providing meaningful financial inclusion for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Patryk Kalisz, Head of Controlling and Reporting, FairMoney; Siddharth Kulkarni,\n\nExecutive Sponsor, Lending, Nigeria at FairMoney; Nicolas Berthozat, Co-Founder\n\nFairMoney and Juris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161, Head of Risk, Nigeria, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s\n\nconference.\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals and small businesses without collateral. This is the segment FairMoney serves and Yaw Mante, the startup\u2019s Head of Finance revealed that not only have they been able to offer loans to these people, but they have also had a very low default rate.\n\nHe disclosed that in order to do this, the startup makes use of data science and underwriting algorithms to predict how likely an individual is to default on their loan before deciding how much risk they are able to take.\n\nIn the absence of data on users, the startup may initially give such customers smaller amounts to gauge their ability to repay the loans. Depending on how the borrower performs, they are then able to offer higher amounts to them. So far, in 2021, the startup has given out loans worth more than \u20a670 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Oluwatomide Oluwole, Finance Manager, FairMoney; Henry Obiekea, VP Capital\n\nMarkets, FairMoney; Yaw Mante, Head, Finance \u2013 FairMoney and James Edeh, Head,\n\nCompliance, FairMoney, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s conference.\n\nHaving recently acquired a microfinance license, Mante explained the reason for that, \u201cLoans are not the only products that our customers need. They need to be able to pay, they need to be able to save, they need to be able to invest. The way that we think about our business is that we look at our customers, we look at what they need and we try to work with them to provide that.\n\nIn order to do all of these things, we need to upscale our license and hence why we acquired the microfinance license. Over time, we\u2019ll look at our options to continue to provide more complex products and services to our customers.\u201d\n\nWith several players in the fintech industry, Mante discussed the startup\u2019s evolution towards a multi-product full-fledged digital bank. \u201cOur unique selling point is we want to be able to provide all of the banking needs of our customers but we start with the product we think is the most pressing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a lot of startups, a Series B is often followed by expansion. However, Hainy says FairMoney would consolidate its position in its current markets. \u201cI think we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in Nigeria and India. They are two out of the four biggest countries in the world and they\u2019re very underserved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Obiekea, VP Capital Markets, FairMoney\n\nHe also pointed out that while the fintech space in India and Nigeria possess some similarities, there are more people in India who possess some level of digital identification compared to Nigeria.\n\nThere was also a panel session on the role of fintech startups in financial inclusion in Nigeria. It featured Nicole Yembra, Founder and Managing Partner of Chrysalis Capital, Sonnie Ayere, GMD/CEO, DLM Capital Group, Yaw Mante, Head of Finance, FairMoney, and Bayo Rotimi, Managing Director of Greenwich Merchant Bank.\n\nDespite the progress recorded by fintech startups in the country, the jury is still out on how much impact they really have with the vast majority of the country still lacking access to the financial system. Hainy sees this as a challenge and believes that FairMoney is perfectly positioned to solve this challenge.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is just above the global average of 11.7%.\n\nThe report was based on a survey conducted on 1,205 Nigerian Internet users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria is the sixth country with the highest rate of NFT adoption out of the 20 countries surveyed. The top five countries were the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\n\nSurprisingly, the US, UK, and Japan, were the bottom three. The survey also went on to estimate that Nigeria\u2019s NFT ownership rate could reach 35% as 21.7% of the surveyed Internet users, plan to own NFTs.\n\nHold on a minute. Can 1,205 Internet users out of 101.72 million tell the true story about NFTs in Nigeria?\n\nHowever, if we consider the fact that Nigeria also ranked sixth in the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis maybe Finders.com\u2019s report isn\u2019t too far fetched.\n\nWhat do you think? Are Nigerians really that big on NFTs? Hit reply and let\u2019s know what you think.\n\nAsilimia\u2019s $2m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsilimia team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nAfrican fintech startup, Asilimia, has raised $2 million to help African Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), digitise their operations and connect them to the formal financial economy. The funding comprises a $1 million pre-seed and $1 million in debt financing.\n\nThe round saw investment from serial entrepreneur, Fredrik Jung Abbou, Co-founder of two unicorns \u2014 Kry, a telemedicine startup and fintech startup, Lendo. Other investors include Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Bpifrance and GreenTec Capital Partners\n\nHow does Asilimia work? The startup helps MSMEs digitise and formalise their operations \u2014 payments, revenue collection, and accounting \u2014 with its digital platform while providing them with credit facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Tekwane Mwendwa and Morgane Kablan, it helps business owners track expenses, payments, and get financial insights on their mobile phones.\n\nWhile Asilimia\u2019s mission could formalise MSMEs on the continent, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 45% were subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2019 according to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA). That number, however, is expected to reach 50% by 2025.\n\nThe startup plans to grow its team and expand into more East African markets with the funding.\n\nOnePipe\u2019s $3.5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePipe team\n\nNigerian fintech API, OnePipe, has closed a $3.5 million seed, co-led by Atlantica Ventures, Tribe Capital and V&R Associates. Other investors include Techstars, Ingressive Capital and Canaan Partners.\n\nOnePipe CEO and Founder, Ope Adeoye, told TechCrunch, that the startup offers embedded banking or banking as a service, \u201cmeaning, we make it possible for non-financial institutions, or businesses in general, to offer banking services to their customers.\u201d\n\nA little back story: Adeoye was a Senior Software Engineer at Interswitch before moving to Zain Nigeria.\n\nInterestingly, he moved back to Interswitch to lead the creation of Quickteller. After eleven years at Interswitch, Adeoye built OnePipe in November 2018 to create seamless partnerships between fintechs and banks.\n\nWith this new funding, the startup has plans to expand into other African countries through a partnership with Sendy, a logistics and freight company.\n\nWant to know more about OnePipe?

          "text": "Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria on Friday night said growth has returned to pre-pandemic levels. This, he says is due to growth-enhancing measures of the bank.\n\nSimilarly, he has projected that gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at 3.10 percent for 2021 up from -1.8 percent in 2020.\n\nEmefiele said this at the 56th annual bankers\u2019 dinner, organised by the Chartered Institute Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN).\n\nNigeria\u2019s GDP growth rate for 2019 stood at 2.3 percent, on the back of a relatively strong fourth-quarter GDP of 2.55 percent. This growth was accompanied by significant foreign capital inflows due to improved fundamentals of the economy.\n\nRead also: CBN to set up International Finance Centre in Eko Atlantic City\n\n\u201cReal GDP growth rate is projected to remain robust and strengthen within the short-term. The output growth rate is projected to remain positive from 4.03 percent in the third quarter of 2021 to nearly 2.91 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, implying a total growth of about 3.10 percent for 2021. The short-term projection indicates a continued strengthening,\u201d he said.\n\nOn inflation, he said the headline inflation rate is expected to moderate to 15.35 percent, and 14.91 percent by December 2021 and February 2022, respectively.\n\nCore inflation is equally forecast to slow from 13.74 percent in October 2021 to 13.39 percent in December 2021 and further to 12.68 percent by February 2022.\n\nFood inflation is expected to slow from 19.57 percent to 17.26 percent and 16.58 percent over the same period.\n\nDomestic disinflation, he added is projected on the backdrop of the favourable impact of the various CBN interventions on the real sector and the gradual upscale of economic activity, which is expected to keep prices moderate in the near term.\n\n\u201cInflation is expected to continue on its downward trajectory into 2022 as continued interventions along with the onset of the harvest season aid improved supply of food items, which would further help to decelerate inflationary pressures,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the overall business confidence index is projected to rise significantly from -9.2 index points at end of August to over 37.7 index points in November 2021 and surpass 57.6 index points by mid-2022.\n\nOn foreign exchange (FX) reserves, he said based on in-house analysis and simulations, external reserves could surpass US$42 billion by mid-2022 from the US$41.5 billion in third-quarter 2021, based on the dynamics of oil price and FX demand for import.\n\nGenerally, external reserves are expected to be relatively comfortable levels with expectations of the sustained trend of current crude oil price, the impact of Eurobond Issuance, and stable exchange rate conditions.\n\nIn less than four weeks since its launch, almost 600,000 downloads of the e-naira application have taken place, Godwin Emefiele, CBN\n\nHe said efforts are ongoing to encourage faster adoption of the e-naira by Nigerians who do not have smartphones.\n\nHe stressed that the support of the financial industry will be critical in the ongoing deployment of the e-naira and efforts are ongoing to encourage continued partnership between the CBN and stakeholders in the financial industry.\n\nEmefiele said as a result of the demand management policy, the naira has remained largely stable around N411/US$1 at the I&E window particularly since the discontinuation of FX allocation to Bureau De Change operators along with the convergence between the CBN and NAFEX rates.\n\nBanks are able to meet the demands of their customers seeking forex for SMEs, school fees, medical and PTAs, which has reduced the need of customers to rely on alternative providers of foreign exchange. The average daily Fx turnover at the I&E window is now over $250million, up from $40million in April 2020.\n\n\u201cI would like to state that notwithstanding these positive indicators, our economic growth remains fragile, as our unemployment and inflation rate remains at levels that are not very supportive of growth,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has projected the country\u2019s economy to grow by 3.0 percent in 2021, up from negative growth of -1.8 percent in 2020.\n\nCBN governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele who made the projection while delivering his Keynote Address at the 56th CIBN Annual Bankers Dinner in Lagos on Friday, noted that although Covid-19 pandemic had huge negative impact on the Nigerian economy, the efforts of monetary and fiscal authorities have made quick recovery possible.\n\nEmefiele also noted that the country\u2019s Inflation is expected to continue on its downward trajectory into 2022 as continued interventions along with the onset of the harvest season aid improved supply of food items, which would further help to decelerate inflationary pressures.\n\nSpeaking about how the CBN responded to the challenges posed by the pandemic, Emefiele said, \u201cFirst, the Central Bank of Nigeria worked with the fiscal authorities in instituting strong policy support measures capped under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), which was designed to contain the effects of the pandemic, restore stability to the economy by helping households and businesses affected by the pandemic and to lift our economy out of the woods through massive interventions to critical sectors.\n\n\u201cUnder this plan, the monetary and fiscal authorities collectively mobilized and injected over N5trillion to support households and businesses. It is gratifying to state that the Central Bank of Nigeria deployed more than N3.5trillion, \u2013 about 4.1 percent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP to critical sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, electricity, and healthcare in order to stimulate and help the economy recover from the deep shock. Other specific policy measures undertaken include.\n\n-Reduction of the monetary policy rate from 13.5 to 11.5 percent to improve the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\n-Reduction of the interest rate on CBN intervention loans from 9 to 5 percent.\n\nExtension of the moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facility to March 2022.\n\n-Granted regulatory forbearance that allow banks restructure loans given to sectors severely affected by the pandemic.\n\n-Strengthened the Loan to Deposit ratio policy, which has resulted in a significant rise in loans provided by financial institutions. Total gross credit rose by over 21.1 percent over the past year, from N19.4 trillion to N23.5 trillion.\n\n-Created a N50 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises through the Nirsal Microfinance Bank, against which N363.5 billion has been disbursed to over 767,000 Nigerian households and micro businesses.\n\n-Mobilized key stakeholders in the Nigerian economy, under the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) team that raised N39.646 to support the fight against the scourge. The funds were used to support three (3) key priority areas:(i) development of 39 fully equipped isolation centres including Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and molecular testing labs and procurement of medical equipment such as PCR test kits across the country; (ii) provision of palliatives in the form of essential food items to 1.7 million households, an equivalent of 8 million Nigerians; and (iii) improving awareness in rural awareness on the COVID-19 virus and capacity building for community health workers.\n\n-Created a N1 trillion facility in loans to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors; of which 53 major manufacturing projects, 21 agriculture related projects and 13 service projects are being funded from this facility.\n\n-Creation of a NGN100 billion intervention fund for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions. We have increased this fund to N200 billion to accommodate more players in the healthcare sector, such as phytomedicine practitioners and manufacturers of medical devices and vaccines. Our primary focus is to create a hub where medical officers can have access to diagnostic equipment to carry out quality medical services at an affordable price for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor noted that so far, over N107.7 billion has been released to support 114 healthcare projects, including six (6) greenfield (new) and 108 are expansionary (brownfield).\n\nThe projects financed, he said, included cancer treatment centres, medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, dental services, eye clinics, and other healthcare service providers.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to inform you that the intervention programs have contributed to the increased bed space in our hospitals, and improved healthcare productivity as evident in the increased number of successfully treated Covid 19 patients,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\n\u201cThese developmental initiatives combined with our monetary and financial policies have helped to support the recovery of our economy and in re-aligning general macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the measures taken by the apex bank led to robust economic recovery, with GDP growth at 4.03 percent in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a result of these measures, we witnessed robust economic recovery as GDP growth stood at 4.03% in the 3rd quarter of 2021, following the 5.01% growth recorded in the 2nd Quarter of 2021. The economy has remained on a positive growth path for four consecutive quarters after the recession in the 3rd quarter of 2020. 41 out of the 46 sectors assessed in the 3rd quarter by NBS, recorded positive growth, as growth was driven by significant improvements in the non-oil sector, particularly, Agriculture Manufacturing, Trade, ICT, Construction, Finance and Transportation. We have also witnessed a gradual recovery in manufacturing output growth as the Manufacturing PMI index rose to 47.3 points in October 2021 from 44.9 in January 2021.\n\n\u201cOur interventions particularly in the manufacturing and the agriculture sectors significantly helped to encourage continuous improvements in growth in these two key sectors of our economy. Today, our food production systems have become more sustainable due to the improved output at our farms and local factories. Output of staple commodities such as rice, maize, palm oil and tomatoes have grown significantly, and we have also seen increased efforts of our local manufacturing firms to engage in backward integration efforts. Second, a visit to any major retail chain will reveal an increasing number of high quality made in Nigeria products relative to imported goods, which is helping to increase domestic production, generate employment and wealth in our country. If these intervention efforts were not carried out by the monetary and fiscal authorities, our economy would have been in a grim state.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also noted that the efforts of the apex bank have helped to reduce inflation despite the disruptions in the supply chain caused by Covid-19.\n\n\u201cInflation has continued to moderate for seven consecutive months, as it declined from 18.17 percent in March 2021 to 15.9 percent in October 2021 supported by improved output of staple food items. Inflation however still remains above our benchmark, which means efforts must continue to be made to slow down the pace of the rise in prices.\u201d\n\nOn External Reserves, he said: \u201cSupported by our demand management policy, in addition to support from the successful issuance of the $4bn Eurobond and the IMF SDR, our external reserves today stands at over $41.4bn which is enough to support 9 months of imports. This is not just a morale booster for both foreign direct and portfolio investors willing to invest in the economy, but it provides significant fire power to support our domestic industries that need to import critical machines and equipment for domestic production and exports.\u201d\n\nOn Exchange Rate, Emefiele said, \u201cAs a result of our demand management policy, the naira has remained largely stable around N411/US$1 at the I&E window particularly since the discontinuation of FX allocation to Bureau De Change operators along with the convergence between the CBN and NAFEX rates. Banks are now able to meet the demands of their customers seeking forex for SMEs, school fees, medical and PTAs, which has reduced the need of customers to rely on alternative providers of foreign exchange. Average daily Fx turnover at the I&E window is now over $250million, up from $40million in April 2020.\n\n\u201cOur current account deficit has narrowed significantly, from a huge deficit of 4.53% of GDP in the 4th quarter of 2020 to negative 0.44% of GDP in the 2nd quarter of 2021 due to a surplus position in the goods account. The surplus position in the goods account is due to a reduction in imports, increase in crude oil and gas export receipts, and improvement in remittance inflows. Remittance inflows have been supported by our naira for dollar program, and we have seen a surge in remittance inflows from over $5m per week in June 2020 to over $100m per week in October 2021.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the outlook of the economy, he said, \u201cFollowing the impact of the various accommodative policy measures, our economy made a swift exit from the recession. Unlike the five quarters it took to exit the previous recession, the economy rebounded after just two quarters of contractions, underpinning the resilience of the economy amid greater policy support. I am pleased to note that growth has returned to pre-covid levels due to the accommodative policy support provided by the monetary and fiscal authorities.\n\n\u201cAlthough uncertainties remain around the mutating Delta virus, prospects of a broad-based economic recovery in Nigeria remain bright as efforts are made to improve access to vaccines for Nigerians, in addition to measures aimed at implementing safety protocols to curb the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these growth enhancing policy measures, we project that GDP will grow at 3.0 percent for 2021 up from -1.8 percent in 2020. Inflation is expected to continue on its downward trajectory into 2022 as continued interventions along with the onset of the harvest season aid improved supply of food items, which would further help to decelerate inflationary pressures.\u201d",

It also underscores the increasing interest in digital technology and IT support services while ensuring sustained development.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJohannisson explained that having Nigeria as its largest market of operations globally is a testament to the company\u2019s commitment to developing the tech support sector in Nigeria and Africa whilst nurturing talents in the country through the help of its sister company, Elev8.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that tech support is instrumental in driving our customers\u2019 brand and overall customer experience. We are uniquely positioned to help companies leverage the existing investments they make in customer support to drive product adoption, increase renewal rates, and ultimately top-line revenue growth.\n\n\u201cMany of the services we offer to our customers require technical expertise and we invest very heavily in digital skilling and employee development, growing a skilled workforce for the ICT industry,\u201d he said.\n\nHe maintained that, \u201cAt Tek Experts, we offer both a place to develop IT skills and a place to leverage those skills with job opportunities supporting some of the most cutting-edge technology for the biggest global brands.\u201d\n\nHe further revealed the firm\u2019s goals, saying that in the coming years, \u201cwe want to be recognised, as the employer of choice in every market in which we operate.

Sunday Igboho did not commit any offence whatsoever; that\u2019s our position.

The declaration was even backed by the order of the Court, but as you can see even the international community did not recognise FG\u2019s declaration on IPOB.\n\n\u201cSo it has failed to be effective or to achieve the desired results.\n\n\u201cThey have not been banned from travelling to other countries, while their citizenship remains intact; it has not been denounced. \u201cSo what type of declaration is that?\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that Nigerians will not take the herdsmen as terrorists, but should regard the criminality of the few among them against innocent people as acts of terrorism just as we see IPOB and their attacks on security agencies and other northern citizens as acts of terrorism.\n\n\u201cVery few herdsmen are bandits if you go through their population.\n\n\u201cI hope this declaration will not give the licence to people to be profiling herdsmen in general as terrorists and taking laws into their hands against them.\n\n\u201cIt will cause more mayhem. The declaration will not change anything, it will not change the dynamics. Already the military is engaging them.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t stop them from kidnappings and killings. The declaration will not end their aggression against the society.\n\n\u2018It is a socio-political problem\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Fulani banditry is a socio-economic problem. We have seen it, we interacted widely with them.\n\n\u201cWe told the federal government the way out. It can only be won through engagement, dialogue and justice.\n\n\u201cThat is why today there is relative peace in the Niger Delta because government have accepted the painful reality of rehabilitating and empowering them.\n\n\u201cThere has to be equitable distribution of wealth in Nigeria and justice for every one.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to accept it. Before the issue of banditry that now affects all of us, the Fulani have suffered so much.\n\n\u201cThey have lost their legitimate means of livelihood; I mean their cows through cattle rustling and extortion by security agencies.\n\n\u201cThat has to be addressed as a means of genuine reconciliation and integration.

          "title": "Abuja-Kaduna railroad passengers as endangered species",
          "text": "At a time the federal government is fighting hard to win the war against insecurity, hoodlums suspected to be kidnappers have resolved to strike on the Abuja-Kaduna railroad attacking travellers. KEHINDE OSASONA in this report reflects on the recent attacks.\n\nAlthough the report of bomb explosions along the Abuja-Kaduna train routes was initially denied by officials of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), it is no longer news that a number of Abuja -bound passengers penultimate week were rattled after they got a dose of the nightmares usually experienced by victims of attacks on the Abuja-Kaduna highway in the past.\n\nThe incident, said to have occurred in the night, involved a train which was heading to Riggasa train station after taking off from the Idu station in Abuja around 8pm.\n\nBlueprint Weekend gathered that the passengers had barely settled down for the about one and a half hour journey when a loud bang suspected to be caused by an explosion device suddenly shut down the train engine. The bomb planted by suspected terrorists reportedly hit their train, forcing it to derail at a distance meters.\n\nImmediately after the explosion, the train air-conditioning and lights were put off. This was reported followed by a rain of bullets which shattered the driver\u2019s windscreen, just as the police escorts, who were outnumbered, could only provide little resistance.\n\nNRC\u2019s explanations\n\nWhile confirming the attack, the managing director of the NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria, said the explosives damaged the rail tracks somewhere between Dutse and Rijana, in the Kaduna section of the corridor.\n\n\u201cYes, there was an explosive on our rail track somewhere around Rijana and Dutse last night, and this damaged the tracks. He however confirmed to newsmen that efforts are currently ongoing to ensure that the train services along the Kaduna-Abuja route are fully restored. Okhiria nevertheless denied reports making the rounds that gunshots were aimed at the train driver. According to him, \u201cThere was nothing like that; it was only an explosive that went up on the track.\u201d\n\nAlso confirming the incident, one of the passengers, a former lawmaker who represented Kaduna South, Senator Shehu Sani, was quoted as saying that the bandits did not only attack, they also planted an explosive that damaged the rail track and shattered the windshield of the train engine. \u201cThe train nearly skidded off its track, and then we miraculously escaped,\u201d he said.\n\nSani said further that they equally opened fire, targeting the driver, and the tank around Dutse and Rijana stations.\n\nNo one ever had any premonition that the railway transportation could as well be a target by bandits when the President Muhammadu Buhari administration was flagging off the project, but the unthinkable happened.\n\nWhile carrying out the commissioning some years back, the President noted that the project would impact on the lives of the Abuja residents as well as Kaduna state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am delighted to be here today to commission the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway track and flag-off the Abuja-Kaduna train services (Passengers & Freight) on Nigeria\u2019s first ever Standard Gauge Rail track to go into operation. This project was conceived by a previous administration, started by the last government and I am pleased to complete and commission it.\n\n\u201cIt is our vision and hopes that those good old days will soon be back with us and indeed in a more prosperous way with the restoration of the rail transport system which today\u2019s occasion symbolises.\n\n\u201cThe construction of the Abuja-Kaduna Standard Gauge rail track commenced in 2009 and happily, sixteen years after, we are on the threshold of presenting to Nigerians a Standard Gauge Railway Train Service that will be safe, fast and reliable.\n\n\u201cI wish to also reassure Nigerians that due attention will be placed on pursuing the 25-Year Strategic Railway Master Plan which is aimed at rehabilitating the existing 3,505km narrow gauge rail line and developing and constructing new standard gauge rail lines across the country.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the symbolic return of rail service today I wish to reiterate the commitment of this Administration to pursue with greater vigour and determination rehabilitation and construction of other rail lines including the major Lagos-Calabar and Kano-Lagos lines. As we get down to work, I look forward to flagging off many more lines outlined in our transport policy programme.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing his experience, a commuter, Shuaib Gidado, told this reporter that despite the unfortunate incident, he would still stick to the railway means of transportation.\n\nAccording to him, the railway transportation, especially the new Abuja-Kaduna route, remains one of the best things that have happened to commuters plying the Abuja-Kaduna road and who now see it as their best alternative.\n\n\u201cConsidering nasty experiences on the Kaduna road where people again lost their lives recently, I still think it\u2019s the best and I will still ply it. Insecurity, explosion though becoming something else especially the explosion incident of last month, I hope something would be done to allay commuters fears,\u201d Gidado said.\n\nLikewise, another commuter who plies the Abuja-Kaduna road on a regular basis, Engr. Olabiyi Teniola, expressed concerns over the attacks and urged the government to ensure passengers\u2019 safety on the route. He also called the various security agencies to scale up their surveillance to stem the scourge.\n\n\u201cWe no longer feel safe. These bandits are becoming more daring. We can only hope and pray that the authorities would be proactive and checkmate activities of these people before they overrun Abuja.\n\n\u201cIs it that Nigerians are now at the mercy of these blood-thirsty gunmen? It is high time our government took the bull by the horns so that what happened some years back when bombers invaded Abuja will not repeat itself,\u201d Teniola said.\n\nFG\u2019s assurances\n\nBut allaying commuters fears after the incident, the federal government pledged its readiness to do the needful in order to protect the citizens.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, gave the assurance during his visit to the site. According to him, the federal government was going to procure digital security system for regular monitoring of railway corridors to avert another incident track bombing.\n\nHe added that the government would in next to no time approve the installation of a digital security system to address future challenges of breach of security.\n\n\u201cWhat is significant is that the work was done by Nigerians in record time and by tomorrow (Saturday), we expect to run the first train.\n\n\u201cApart from this (Wednesday explosion), there has not been any security challenge before now. What this has done to us will fasten the procurement of the digital security system that we are trying to put in place. We took it to the cabinet two weeks ago, and it was returned. We will take it again to ensure we get approval so we can install it.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the security system is to enable us to know if there is an impact on the censor. We will try to get the police involved before we install the security system.\n\n\u201cI may not be happy that the security breach took place but what we have been able to show is that we actually have the capacity to fix our rail. The essence of this is that by the time we leave, we should start getting people who can construct our railways. What they (local engineers) have shown is that if they can fix this, they should be able to construct some kilometres of rail. But we have to test them gradually,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "For the umpteenth time, President Muhammadu Buhari has given marching orders to the security chiefs to go after insurgents, bandits and terrorists, saying they must not rest until all Nigerians are at rest.\n\nThe president also expressed happiness over the free and fair gubernatorial election held in Anambra and the roles played by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and reassured that nothing would threaten the 2023 general elections.\n\nMinister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola stated this Thursday while briefing journalists at the end of the National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by the president at the Presidential Villa Abuja.\n\nAregbesola said President Buhari appreciated the successes and gains recorded by all security chiefs, the security agencies and intelligence organisations on security situation nationwide after he received briefs from them at the meeting.\n\n\u201cHe (Buhari) is of the belief that more must and should still be done. But he commended all of them for the progress we are recording on all fronts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further stated that the president ordered the armed forces and other security agencies, intelligence organisations, not to rest on their oars, notwithstanding the progress and efforts being made to eliminate insurgency, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, and all the other criminalities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president said that we are not yet where we should be. That Nigerians deserve to live in peace. And that until we achieved that we will not rest.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said the president was particularly pleased with the outcome of the November 6 governorship elections that produced former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) Professor Charles Soludo, as the Anambra governor-elect.\n\n\u201cThe President was particularly happy with the fact that a free and fair election was made possible by the INEC and our security agencies.\n\n\u201cAnd that that is a good assurance to all Nigerians, that we are committed to promoting democracy, that is in respect of Anambra election.\n\n\u201cAnd he was quite happy that the combination of INEC and the security agencies, from the military to the police and all the other agencies made that possible with the support of the people and the government of Anambra.\n\n\u201cWe all saw the outcome. With that there is no doubt as to the commitment of our administration to promoting democracy, and ensuring that 2023 is not in any way threatened,\u201d Aregbesola said.\n\nINTERPOL\n\nHe said Buhari was also particularly happy with the news that the Head of INTERPOL National Central Bureau, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Garba Umar, has been elected Vice President (Africa) and Executive Committee Member of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL).\n\nAsked if the resurgence of criminal activities along Abuja-Kaduna highways was discussed at the meeting, Aregbesola said: \u201cOh, yes. The police and other security agencies had been mobilised to intensify surveillance, patrol in pursuit of the criminals.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not only about Abuja-Kaduna. Yes, Abuja-Kaduna belt was discussed specifically, but we appreciated the fact that we are in the season of festivity.\n\n\u201cSo, all agencies committed to providing security for Nigeria and the maintenance of law and order, have been ordered to improve on their activities, intensify surveillance and minimize, if not eliminate totally any threat to law and order anywhere in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAsked if the military or the police will be taking the lead, he said: \u201cPolice, as I said, is the lead agency on internal security.\n\n\u201cSo whatever I\u2019ve said about maintenance of law and order will start with the police and then extend to all the other security agencies, certainly.\u201d\n\nAlso asked if the issue or bandits collecting ransom, taking over and administering some areas in the country was discussed, he said: \u201cSpecific orders have been given to all our security agencies.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll see an improved response to all those challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria in whatever form and creating insecurity in whatever form anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe council, today, took firm decision on what to be done and I can assure Nigerians that with the charge from the President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces today (Thursday), there will be an improved response to all forms of criminality in any part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn whether there were new strategies to that effect, especially as it was not the first time such charge would be given by President Buhari, the minister said: \u201cBut what I know is that for as long as there is life, we must not rest until our objective of making Nigeria safe for Nigerians is made possible.\n\n\u201cSo, I am convinced that with the renewed charge to our security agencies, from the military, to the police, intelligence organisations and all other security forces, certainly Nigerians will feel and live better going forward.\u201d\n\nRoll call\n\nPresent at the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Chief of Staff to the President Professor Ibrahim Gambari; National Security Adviser (NSA) -ajor General Babagana Monguno (retd) and Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General LEO Irabor.\n\nAlso in attendance were Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of Air Staff as well as the Inspector General of Police Usman Baba Alkali.\n\nBefore the commencement of the meeting, President Buhari, with the assistance of Vice President Osinbajo, had decorated his Aide De Camp (ADC) Lt.-Col Yusuf Mukhtar Dodo with his new red neck rank of Colonel.\n\nTroops kill 30 terrorists\n\nMeanwhile, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) Thursday said troops of Operation HADIN KAI in the North-east have killed over 90 Boko Haram/ Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP) terrorists and arrested 21 others.\n\nThe military also said a total of 996 terrorists and their families comprising 203 males, 302 females and 491 children surrendered to troops at different locations in Borno state.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations (DMO) Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko stated this while briefing journalists on update of military operations across the country from 11 to 25.\n\nHe said troops also arrested a notorious terrorist named Mr Haladu Saleh, who had been on wanted list since 2018.\n\nHe said \u201cIn the course of these operations, no fewer than 90 terrorists were neutralized and 21 of them arrested.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, although a few setbacks were experienced in the course of these operations within the last 2 weeks, however, troops remained undaunted and determined in their quest to attain sustainable peace in the country through kinetic and non-kinetic operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cTroops of Operation HADIN KAI within the period under review carried out extensive land and air operations across the theatre.\n\n\u201cNotably, on 12 November, 2021, the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI decimated BHT/ISWAP terrorist elements in offensive air strikes in a location within Baga near the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on 13 November, 2021, own troops in a coordinated ground and air attacks, repelled terrorists\u2019 attack on troops at Askira Uba in Borno state. During the counter-offensive operation, over 50 of the terrorists were neutralized and several of their combat equipment, including gun trucks and other weapons were destroyed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said troops arrested Boko Haram logistics supplies and two drug peddlers named Mr Ezekiel Karson and Galadima Bako with large quantities of cannabis sativa.\n\nHe added that many kidnapped victims were freed and assorted weapons were seized from the terrorists.\n\n\u201cAlso, 98 assorted weapons, including AK-47 rifles and 2,589 rounds of ammunitions were recovered within the period. Additionally, seven kidnapped civilians were rescued.\n\n\u201cTheir fighting vehicles as well as large caches of arms and ammunition were recovered during the encounter. However, some of our gallant officers and soldiers paid the supreme prize,\u201d he said.",

One weapon was recovered, Andrews told reporters at a briefing afterward.\n\nA department store employee who was working at the time of shooting told WRAL-TV, based in nearby Raleigh, that he counted six gunshots that rang out through the mall, triggering a stampede of Black Friday shoppers running for the nearest exit.\n\n\u201cA lot of people started running my way, and once I heard all six rapidly, I started to run, too,\u201d he told the TV station.\n\nThe Streets at Southpoint mall was locked down and evacuated as law enforcement swept through the shopping center.\n\nA short time earlier across the country, security officer shot a man suspected of trying to steal merchandise from a Walmart store during an altercation in the eastern Washington town of Kennewick, police said.\n\nThe shooting occurred when the suspect, confronted as he was leaving the store, pointed a gun at the officer. The officer then drew his own weapon and opened fire at the suspect, who fled the scene but was arrested at a nearby home, according to police.\n\nThe suspect, taken to an area hospital for treatment of his wounds, was already wanted on nine outstanding warrants and now faces additional robbery and assault charges, police said in a statement.\n\nNo one else was injured at the Walmart.

          "text": "The discovery of a new coronavirus variant named Omicron triggered global alarm on Friday as countries rushed to suspend travel from southern Africa and stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic suffered their biggest falls in more than a year.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said Omicron may spread more quickly than other forms, and preliminary evidence suggested there is an increased risk of reinfection.\n\nEpidemiologists warned travel curbs may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally. The new mutations were first discovered in South Africa and have since been detected in Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.\n\nThe United States will restrict travel from South Africa and neighbouring countries effective Monday, a senior Biden administration official said.\n\nGoing further, Canada said it was closing its borders to those countries, following bans on flights announced by Britain, the European Union and others.\n\nBut it could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the variant\u2019s mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it. Omicron is the fifth variant of concern designated by the WHO.\n\nThe variant has a spike protein that is dramatically different than the one in the original coronavirus that vaccines are based on, the UK Health Security Agency said, raising fears about how current vaccines will fare.\n\nScientists issued similar warnings.\n\n\u201cThis new variant of the COVID-19 virus is very worrying. It is the most heavily mutated version of the virus we have seen to date,\u201d said Lawrence Young, a virologist at Britain\u2019s University of Warwick.\n\n\u201cSome of the mutations that are similar to changes we\u2019ve seen in other variants of concern are associated with enhanced transmissibility and with partial resistance to immunity induced by vaccination or natural infection.\u201d\n\nThose worries pummelled financial markets, especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector, and oil, which tumbled by about $10 a barrel.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) closed down 2.5%, its worst day since late October 2020, and European stocks (.STOXX) had their worst day in 17 months.\n\nCruise operators Carnival Corp (CCL.N), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL.N) and Norwegian Cruise Line plunged more than 10% each, while shares in United Airlines (UAL.O), Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and American Airlines (AAL.O) slumped almost as much.\n\n\u2018MOST SIGNIFICANT VARIANT\u2019\n\nSeveral other countries including India, Japan, Israel, Turkey, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates also toughened travel curbs. read more\n\nIn Geneva the WHO \u2013 whose experts on Friday discussed the risks presented by the variant, called B.1.1.529 \u2013 had earlier warned against travel curbs for now. read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that there are no knee-jerk responses,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s emergencies director Mike Ryan, praising South Africa\u2019s public health institutions for picking up the new variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nRichard Lessells, a South Africa-based infectious disease expert, also expressed frustration at travel bans, saying the focus should be on getting more people vaccinated in places that have struggled to access sufficient shots.\n\n\u201cThis is why we talked about the risk of vaccine apartheid. This virus can evolve in the absence of adequate levels of vaccination,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nLess than 7% of people in low-income countries have received their first COVID-19 shot, according to medical and human rights groups. Meanwhile, many developed nations are giving third-dose boosters.\n\n\u201cFailure to help vaccinate sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 still barely 4% of the population \u2013 left us all exposed to risk of a new, more virulent #COVID variant,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva wrote on Twitter. \u201cNews of #Omricon is an urgent reminder of why we need to do even more to vaccinate the world.\u201d\n\nTOO LATE FOR TRAVEL CURBS?\n\nThe coronavirus has swept the world in the two years since it was first identified in central China, infecting 260 million people and killing 5.4 million.\n\nOne epidemiologist in Hong Kong said it may be too late to tighten travel curbs against the latest variant.\n\n\u201cMost likely this virus is already in other places. And so if we shut the door now, it\u2019s going to be probably too late,\u201d said Ben Cowling of the University of Hong Kong.\n\nDiscovery of the new variant comes as Europe and the United States enter winter, with more people gathering indoors in the run-up to Christmas, providing a breeding ground for infection.\n\nFriday also marked the start of the holiday shopping period in the United States, but stores were less crowded than in years past.\n\nRealtor Kelsey Hupp, 36, was at the Macy\u2019s department store in downtown Chicago on Black Friday.\n\n\u201cChicago is pretty safe and masked and vaccinated. I got my booster so I\u2019m not too concerned about it,\u201d she said.",

          "title": "South African Scientists Brace for Wave Propelled by Omicron Variant",
          "text": "\u201cYoung people, in their 20s to just over their late 30s, are coming in with moderate to severe disease, some needing intensive care. About 65% are not vaccinated and most of the rest are only half-vaccinated,\u201d said Mathivha. \u201cI\u2019m worried that as the numbers go up, the public health care facilities will become overwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a marked change in the demographic profile of patients with COVID-19,\u201d Rudo Mathivha, head of the intensive care unit at Soweto\u2019s Baragwanath Hospital, told an online press briefing.\n\nIn the space of two weeks, the omicron variant has sent South Africa from a period of low transmission to rapid growth of new confirmed cases. The country\u2019s numbers are still relatively low, with 2,828 new confirmed cases recorded Friday, but omicron\u2019s speed in infecting young South Africans has alarmed health professionals.\n\nAs the world grapples with the emergence of the new highly transmissible variant of COVID-19, worried scientists in South Africa \u2014 where omicron was first identified \u2014 are scrambling to combat its lightning spread across the country.\n\nShe said urgent preparations are needed to enable public hospitals to cope with a potential large influx of patients needing intensive care.\n\n\u201cWe know we have a new variant,\u201d said Mathivha. \u201cThe worst case scenario is that it hits us like delta \u2026 we need to have critical care beds ready.\u201d\n\nWhat looked like a cluster infection among some university students in Pretoria ballooned into hundreds of new cases and then thousands, first in the capital city and then to nearby Johannesburg, South Africa\u2019s largest city.\n\nStudying the surge, scientists identified the new variant that diagnostic tests indicate is likely responsible for as many as 90% of the new cases, according to South Africa\u2019s health officials. Early studies show that it has a reproduction rate of 2 \u2014 meaning that every person infected by it is likely to spread it to two other people.\n\nThe new variant has a high number of mutations that appear to make it more transmissible and help it evade immune responses. The World Health Organization looked at the data on Friday and named the variant omicron, under its system of using Greek letters, calling it a highly transmissible variant of concern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge concern. We all are terribly concerned about this virus,\u201d Professor Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThis variant is mostly in Gauteng province, the Johannesburg area of South Africa. But we\u2019ve got clues from diagnostic tests \u2026 that suggest that this variant is already all over South Africa,\u201d said Hanekom, who is also co-chair of the South African COVID Variant Research Consortium.\n\n\u201cThe scientific reaction from within South Africa is that we need to learn as much as soon as possible. We know precious little,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, we do not know how virulent this virus is, which means how bad is this disease that it causes?\u201d\n\nA key factor is vaccination. The new variant appears to be spreading most quickly among those who are unvaccinated. Currently, only about 40% of adult South Africans are vaccinated, and the number is much lower among those in the 20 to 40-year-old age group.\n\nSouth Africa has nearly 20 million doses of vaccines \u2014 made by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson \u2014 but the numbers of people getting vaccines is about 120,000 per day, far below the government\u2019s target of 300,000 per day.\n\nAs scientists try to learn more about omicron, the people of South Africa can take measures to protect themselves against it, said Hanekom.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique opportunity. There\u2019s still time for people who did not get vaccinated to go and get the vaccine, and that will provide some protection, we believe, against this infection, especially protection against severe infection, severe disease and death,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would call on people to vaccinate if they can.\u201d\n\nSome ordinary South Africans have more mundane concerns about the new variant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen increasing numbers of COVID-19, so I\u2019ve been worried about more restrictions,\u201d said Tebogo Letlapa, in Daveyton, eastern Johannesburg. \u201cI\u2019m especially worried about closing of alcohol sales because it\u2019s almost festive season now.\u201d",
          "summary": "In the space of two weeks, the omicron variant has sent South Africa from a period of low transmission to rapid growth of new confirmed cases.\nWe all are terribly concerned about this virus,\u201d Professor Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, told The Associated Press.\nBut we\u2019ve got clues from diagnostic tests \u2026 that suggest that this variant is already all over South Africa,\u201d said Hanekom, who is also co-chair of the South African COVID Variant Research Consortium.\n\u201cThe scientific reaction from within South Africa is that we need to learn as much as soon as possible.\nAs scientists try to learn more about omicron, the people of South Africa can take measures to protect themselves against it, said Hanekom.",
