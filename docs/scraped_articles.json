          "text": "Ifechukwu Orjiani\n\nDiabetes can be difficult, due to its physical, emotional, financial, social and mental implications. People living with diabetes constantly have to take medication to steady their blood sugar levels, check their blood sugar regularly and be careful of how they live in general. As such, a diabetes diagnosis and condition impact a patient\u2019s loved ones.\n\nIf you know someone with diabetes and you are unsure of how best to help, support and care for them, this article will show you how to do so.\n\nBeing supportive of someone living with diabetes and actively contributing to daily care can help them enjoy the healthiest life possible. To do this, you should offer physical, mental and emotional care.\n\nPhysical care entails monitoring medication, diet and exercise. Remind them to constantly check their blood sugar, and maintain a daily record of their weight, blood sugar readings, medicine schedule, meals, exercise and mood are needed. Ensure there is a medicine routine and medicines are taken at the right times and dosage. Use a pill organiser if needed and offer help if your loved one cannot open or administer their medication themselves. Offer to keep a record of their symptoms or other concerns, and help them talk about them with their doctor. You can also help them make and get to doctor appointments.\n\nMake sure that their diets are high in protein, whole grains, healthy fats, fruits and vegetables. Oily, fatty, fried foods and foods (or drinks) high in refined sugars should be avoided. Drinking lots of water and eating healthy snacks help too. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, reduces blood glucose, controls weight, reduces anxiety, improves mental health reduces the risk for cardiac diseases so it should be prioritised too. Other physical care activities are grooming, bathing, dressing, etc.\n\nAlso, help them join a wellness community, like LiveWell Club, where Nigerians living with diabetes can gain practical knowledge and share experiences that support their treatment, diet and lifestyle changes.\n\nAs diabetes increases the incidence of depression and anxiety; swings in blood sugar can make one jittery, confused, anxious or irritable; mental and emotional care should not be ignored. Offer support, encourage your loved one to join a group or talk about professional counselling if needed. Also, nudging them to engage in daily activities that might help ease stress (taking walks, deep breathing exercises, listening to music, watching a funny movie) are ways to reduce the mental toll of the diabetes journey.\n\nNow, let me share with you five care tips you need when caring for people leaving with diabetes 2.\n\nIn your quest to ensure your loved one stays healthy and avoids diabetes complications, first, educate yourself. Care is curiosity. Learn everything you can about diabetes and your loved one\u2019s specific situation. Research online; offer to accompany them to appointments or diabetes support group meetings. Learn how to prevent emergencies or complications, and how to identify symptoms of low (hypoglycemia) or high (hyperglycemia) blood sugar.\n\nSecond, be patient. Care is compassion. Give your loved one some time to process what can be a lot of information at once. Be patient with the extra time they may need to perform foot care as they get ready in the morning, read nutrition labels when grocery shopping, monitor blood glucose or administer insulin. Don\u2019t disregard the fact that managing diabetes is hard. There\u2019s a thin line between providing support and nagging. If you start lecturing or acting like the diabetes police, they may shut down and refuse your help, and you don\u2019t want that.\n\nThird, make changes, too. Care is commitment. Join them in making healthy lifestyle modifications. Set small goals such as making good food choices, quitting smoking and staying active.\n\nFourth, speak positively. Care is communication. Encourage them in ways they understand and appreciate. Ask, often, how you can help. Be specific about what you\u2019re able to help with. Don\u2019t offer what you\u2019re not willing to provide. If your offer is turned down, let them know the door is open if and when they\u2019re ready. Offer positive support, not negative stories. Although complications can happen, you should keep conversations positive. They don\u2019t need to hear about people who died or had limbs amputated.\n\nFifth, be observant. Care is consciousness. Sometimes, people with type 2 diabetes experience a drop in blood sugar. This can cause cloudy thinking, fatigue and weakness. Find out if your loved one is at risk for low blood sugar and then learn what the symptoms are and how to treat if they are at risk. Be mindful of these symptoms and speak up immediately if you notice a change in behaviour. It\u2019s also helpful to plan how to handle a diabetes-related emergency or what to do in the event of a blood sugar drop. Since low blood sugar can cause confusion, your loved one may be unable to articulate the steps to raise their blood sugar at the moment. In the case of emergencies, contact the medical team immediately.\n\nFinally, a bonus tip: Take care of yourself. Care is cognisance. Recognise your limits and know when to step back. Remember that ultimately, the person with diabetes is responsible for managing it, not you. It helps to have a community of fellow caregivers to help ease your journey.\n\nA diabetes community or support group is very beneficial for the physical and mental health of people living with diabetes, as well as their caregivers.\n\nIfechukwu Orjiani, a certified diabetes nurse educator, writes from Lagos; 09055790893\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Alli said even though he accidentally joined Rotary, his reason for joining the Club was not to lead but to serve.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have never aspired to lead. All I wanted was to serve in my little way. I come from a family with a deep passion for service and giving.\n\n\n\n\u201cI also married from a family which loves to share and give. So, I saw myself only living up to type in Rotary, it does not look extraordinary.\n\n\n\n\u201cI need to explain this to clear doubts about my resilience for service in Rotary. As long as I serve humanity, I do not expect anything in return.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe immediate past President of the Club, Rotn. Victoria Unoarumi, said listed some of her achievements to include increased membership, surpassed goal set for the Rotary Foundation with contribution of $43,718.00, execution of 21 projects in the Rotary\u2019s seven area of focus, completed a star project of a block of five classrooms.\n\n\n\nHigh point of the event was the presentation of awards to 11 distinguished Nigerians for their selfless contributions to the development of the country and humanity.\n\n\n\nThey include Professor Mohammed Haruna, Dr. Wale Babalakin, Senator Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed, Aliyu Abdulhameed, Igho Sanomi, Soliu Mustapha, Ahmad Salihijo, Registrar of the Joint Admission ans Matriculation Board (JAMB), Professor Ishaq Oloyede, Chief Fabian Nwora, Inuwa Kashifu Abdullahi, and Director of Mukhtar Galadima.",

          "text": "Education Minister, Adamu Adamu\n\nSome stakeholders in the education sector have continued to deep express worry over the lingering crisis between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nThey said that the face-off had crippled the livelihood of the people around the universities.\n\nThe stakeholders, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Saturday, called for immediate resolutions so that students would return to their classrooms.\n\nAn educationist, Mr Olaniyi Olawade said the effect of the strike had brought untold hardship on the youths, business owners and had affected the economy of residence where institutions were located.\n\nOlawade said that many students had lost focus and were getting involved in so many criminal activities capable of shortchanging their destinies.\n\nAccording to him, many who earn a living from businesses around the school communities cannot do anything again and have resorted to living unproductive lives.\n\n\u201cThe effects of ASUU strike on the youth of this nation is quite enormous. It has adverse effect on their present and future endeavours as it makes them unproductive and lazy.\n\n\u201cThe strike has done more harm in wasting the precious time of the students and making the youths to become unscrupulous and to lose hope in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nOlawade said that the four months strike had grounded the productive academic sector and other aspects of the economy of the nation.\n\n\u201cAlso, those that are not in the academics but earn their daily bread by selling stuff to the students and academic communities are not finding things easy this period.\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with the government and the academics to sheath their sword and allow peace to reign so that this matter can be resolved once and for all as the students are the most affected by the crisis,\u201d he added.\n\nA civil servant and a mother of three, Mrs Damilola Bankole said that the strike had drawn back the academic progress of students as compared with their colleagues from other climes.\n\nBankole called on the government to wade into the situation by attending to the needs of these universities lecturers, while looking for alternative preventive methods to avoid such crisis in the future.\n\n\u201cOne of the major effect of ASUU strike on Nigerian universities is the fact that it\u2019s going to draw us back. The academic calendar has been drawn backward and for it to pick up again, it will take a lot of time.\n\n\u201cApart from this, it is also going to have a great effect on the smooth transition from secondary school to higher institutions.\n\n\u201cThis is because some students have just concluded writing their WAEC and JAMB examinations and have applied to these universities but as it stands, nothing can be done as they have to be on the queue.\n\n\u201cAnd when there is a queue in the education system of a country, it leads to crimes and other moral decadence in the society because a child who waits more than necessary will be involved in unscrupulous acts,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vice Chancellor, Niger Delta University, Bayelsa, Prof. Samuel Edoumiekumo called on President Muhammadu Buhari to take charge and speed up the process of resolving the ongoing trade dispute with ASUU and other unions.\n\nEdoumiekumo is also the Chairman of the Committee of Vice Chancellors of Nigerian Universities (CVCNU).\n\nHe said that a drastic action must be taken to stem the haemorrhage that the system was currently witnessing for the sake of the Nigerian children.\n\n\u201d I have said that the president should speed up the whole process, take over everything and take a concrete decision and that is even now, so that our students who are at home will be back on campuses.\n\n\u201cSo, we are calling on Mr President to speed up action, so that we call off the strike, and the students can come back to campus,\u201d he said.\n\nA political analyst, Mr Rotimi Lawrence said that the lingering strike should be addressed as it had caused not only a national embarrassment but monumental loss of human capital to the country.\n\nLawrence said that if nothing was done to address industrial disputes in the tertiary institutions, it would continue to affect the global rating of public ivory tower.\n\nMiss Favour Rotimi, a student of Federal University, Oye Ekiti, said that many students were frustrated as a result of the strike and want immediate solution so that they could return to their schools.\n\nRotimi said that the effect of the strike was enormous as some female students were now involved in the act of prostituting, while some had been impregnated.\n\n\u201d We have been at home in the last four months. Many of us tried to get menial jobs to do but we can\u2019t get it when even graduates are still hunting for jobs.\n\n\u201cI will not blame any students who have decided to look for money through other means. What I think the government can do is to facilitate this dialogue with the lecturers so that we can all have our peace as a nation.\n\n\u201d Yes, it is true that the lecturers are demanding for their welfare and the welfare of the university system as a whole.\n\n\u201cThis is not too big for them to ask. We don\u2019t take education seriously as a country and this will continue to affect us even on the global scene,\u201d Rotimi said.(NAN)",

          "text": "Ortom and government functionaries at the flag off of distribution of improved seeds and seedlings in Makurdi\n\nBy Peter Duru, Makurdi\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue state has reiterated the resolve of the state to kick against the reintroduced Water Resources bill before the National Assembly.\n\nRecall that the controversial bill which had in the past generated so much heat in the country after it was introduced in the National Assembly but eventually withdrawn, was few days ago reintroduced in the House of Representatives by the Chairman of the Committee on Water Resources, Sada Soli (APC, Katsina).\n\nGovernor Ortom who reacted to the development weekend in Makurdi while flagging off the distribution of improved seeds and seedlings to farmers in the 23 Local Government Areas, LGAs, of the state said the bill was another form of Ruga and would be unacceptable to the people of Benue state.\n\nHe noted that by the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution, Governors were the custodians of the land which they hold in trust for the people assuring that no one would take away any portion of Benue land under any guise.\n\nThe Governor said: \u201cWe will resist the reintroduction of the Water Resources Bill.\n\nThe federal government should go and concentrate and manage the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, because even if other states accept it, Benue state would not support it.\n\n\u201cIt is an evil bill by the federal government to take over the river banks and allow herdsmen from other parts of Africa to take over the Benue Valley.\n\n\u201cI want to therefore urge Benue indigenes to rise up and reject the bill because it is targeted at taking over our ancestral heritage. In their attempt take over our inheritance they came with Ruga, Cattle colony among others. But the people behind this plot can be rest assured that Benue people will resist any attempt to take over our land and water resources through any guise.\u201d\n\nThe Governor who commeded the Bureau for Local Government and Chieftancy Affairs for initiating the intervention advised Benue people to to take advantage of the government\u2019s agricultural policies and support programmes to farm and cultivate crops in any available space in order to boost all year food production in the state noting that the state was blessed with fertile land that supports the massive production of food and cash crops including onion and water melon \u201cwhich we are now producing in large quantity in Benue state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, whose office is supervising the intervention, Mr. Ken Achabo said the improved seedlings would boost the farm yields of farmers in the state thereby improve their livelihoods.\n\nHe commended Governor Ortom for his relentless efforts to ensure that Benue people were not chased away from their ancestral land by armed herders stressing that the agricultural policies of the government had help boost food production in the state.\n\nThe improved seeds flagged-off for distribution include, 6,900 bags of rice, 833 bags of maize, 1,000 tins of watermelon seeds, 333 bags of sorghum and 11,000 bundles of cassava stems.",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday said it was closely monitoring the security situation in Osun, ahead of July 16 governorship election.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, disclosed this in Abuja at a special meeting of the Inter-agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES).\n\nThe meeting was convened to review security arrangement and plans to ensure a successful governorship poll in the state.\n\nYakubu said that although the situation in Osun was generally calm at the moment, INEC was concerned about some reported clashes in parts of the state.\n\n\u201cIn one recent example, the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) was disrupted in Erin Oke and Erin Ijesha Wards of Oriade Local Government Area resulting in the loss of 46 PVCs.\n\n\u201cWhile the matter is being investigated by the police, the collection of PVCs for the affected wards is now taking place in the INEC office in Ijebu-Jesha.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the state office has compiled the Voter Identification Numbers (VINs) of the cards and the commission has already reprinted the PVCs for the affected voters.\n\n\u201c I willl like to assure all valid registrants in Osun that no one will be disenfranchised on account of such incidence.\n\n\u201cIt is futile for anyone to attempt to vote using another person\u2019s PVC. The Bimodal Voter Accreditation System will expose such fraud and persons apprehended will be prosecuted under the law,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe chairman said the state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Abdulganiyu Raji, and the Commissioner of Police,CP Wale Olokode, would brief the meeting on the readiness for the Osun election.\n\nYakubu said that on the part of INEC headquarters, all necessary arrangements had been completed for a hitch free poll.\n\nHe said that INEC would soon deploy a- readiness-assessment team to Osun to assess its preparations for the election.\n\n\u201cIt will also meet its staff, security agencies, transporters and traditional rulers to solicit their support for peaceful elections.\n\n\u201cWe will also observe the mock accreditation of voters in some Polling Units across the three Senatorial Districts of the state to test the functionality of the BVAS.\n\n\u201cA few days to the election, we will return to Osun to meet with the stakeholders and for the signing of the Peace Accord by political parties and candidates under the auspices of the National Peace Committee,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chairman described vote buying as a major concern in the nation\u2019s elections, but disclosed that INEC was working with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to prosecute persons arrested in connection with vote buying in the Ekiti governorship election.\n\n\u201cAction will commence as soon as the EFCC completes its investigations. I appeal to all security agencies to continue to join hands with the commission to tackle this menace.\u2019\u2019\n\nYakubu appreciated the role played by the anti-corruption and security agencies in apprehending some of the perpetrators of the brazen assault on the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nHe commended the synergy between the commission and the security agencies that ensured a seamless coordination in the widely acclaimed success of the Ekiti governorship election.\n\n\u201cSecurity was well-coordinated. The election was peaceful. Personnel and materials were deployed promptly.\n\n\u201cElection day processes commenced as scheduled. Election technology functioned optimally. Results were transmitted from the polling units and collated at the various collation centres in record time.\n\n\u201c I must, on behalf of the commission, convey our appreciation to all members of ICCES for the success of the election.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to build on the success of the Ekiti experience to ensure improved performance in subsequent elections, including the 2023 general elections,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe chairman also reassured Nigerians who applied for Certified True Copies (CTCs) of documents arising from the recent party congresses, primaries and nomination of candidates that all the requests were being attended to expeditiously, in spite the huge number of documents.\n\n\u201c Nigerian elections, especially the conduct of primaries for the nomination of candidates by political parties, is one of the most litigated in the world.\n\n\u201cAs at yesterday evening (Friday July 1, 2022), 216 requests have so far been processed involving the certification of over 1,650,000 pages of documents.\n\n\u201cIndeed, there are now far more cases challenging the breach of internal democracy within political parties than those involving the conduct of the main elections by INEC.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work round the clock, including the weekends, to ensure that we attend to all applications received at the headquarters of the commission promptly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe National Security Adviser (NSA), retired Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno, who is also Co-Chair of ICCES, urged INEC and ICCES members to build on the successes recorded from the Ekiti election.\n\nMongunu, represented by Sanusi Galadima, said that it was important as some disgruntled politicians might attempt to sabotage the process for their selfish gains, through vote buying and other forms of voter inducement as well as political thuggery.\n\nMonguno commended INEC for the extension of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), which was scheduled to close on June 30, a development he said would enable more eligible voters to obtain their voter cards.\n\n\u201cThe NSA commended INEC, members of ICCES and other strategic stakeholders for their immense contributions toward improving the electoral process in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou will all agree with me that the commission is currently undergoing tremendous transformation through re-calibration of the electoral process in the areas of voter registration/voter education, screening of voters at the polling units (using BVAS) as well as election result collation and transmission.\n\n\u201c Records from the conduct of the last Ekiti governorship election indicated an impressive performance by the INEC as well as the ICCES member agencies as there were no any major incident of security concern recorded during and after the election.\n\n\u201cHowever, more needs to be done in terms of enlightenment campaign to encourage voters to come out and cast their votes on the day of the election.\n\n\u201cThis is because of the low turnout recorded during the election compared to the total number of registered voters in the state.\n\n\u201cConsequent upon the above, the NSA enjoined INEC, through the Department of Voter Education/Publicity, to redouble efforts ahead of the Osun guber election and the forthcoming general elections in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that heads and representatives of various security agencies, INEC National Commissioners, Resident Electoral Commissioner for Osun, Commissioner of Police and Secretary to the Commission attended the meeting.(NAN)",

          "title": "PDP crisis: Real reasons Wike is angry with Atiku",
          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, tension is mounting in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as controversies have continued to trail the nomination of Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as the party\u2019s vice presidential candidate.\n\nPDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, recently unveiled Okowa as his running mate for the 2023 general elections.\n\nPrior to the unveiling of Okowa, the special panel set up by the PDP to shop for a suitable running mate for Atiku had reportedly voted in favour of Wike as the opposition party\u2019s vice presidential candidate by 14 votes to three.\n\nNevertheless, the panel, which consisted of members and representatives of the PDP National Working Committee ( NWC), Governors Forum, Board of Trustees ( BoT), former Ministers Forum recommended Wike, Okowa and the Akwa Ibom governor, Udom Emmanuel as probable vice presidential candidates. But Atiku on his own settled for the Delta governor. Atiku had polled a total of 371 votes, at the PDP convention, to defeat Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, who scored 237 votes, and 11 others.\n\nHowever, there have been unease in the opposition party, since the Delta governor\u2019s unveiling as its vice presidential candidate, as neither the PDP nor Atiku has known peace.\n\nLoyalists of Wike are of the view that he ought to have been chosen as the PDP vice presidential candidate as favoured by the panel. According to them, since the majority of the members of the panel set up to shop for a vice presidential candidate voted for him, he ought to have been selected as Atiku\u2019s running mate.\n\nHowever, while Wike has kept sealed lips over the turn of events, party stakeholders are apprehensive over the likely effect, especially the misgivings the issues surrounding the PDP vice presidential slot might have on the party\u2019s campaign for the 2023 general elections.\n\n2023: PDP panel tips Wike for vice ... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 2023: PDP panel tips Wike for vice presidential candidate\n\nSunday Sun gathered that the crisis has polarized the various organs of the party, including the National Working Committee ( NWC), as well as the PDP Governors Forum, with different groups queuing behind Wike and Atiku/the PDP leadership.\n\nIn the aftermath of the selection of Okowa as Atiku\u2019s running mate, PDP governors have kept away from subsequent party functions. Multiple sources say the failure of the opposition party to hold its grand rally prior to the just concluded Ekiti State governorship poll, as well as the party abysmal performance in the poll is not unconnected to the vice presidential candidate controversy.\n\nLast Tuesday, 11 PDP governors stayed away from the inauguration of the party\u2019s National Campaign Council for the Osun State governorship poll. The governors who were absent included: Nyesom Wike, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Samuel Ortom, Seyi Makinde of Rivers, Enugu, Abia, Benue and Oyo states respectively.\n\nOthers absent at the event included the Chairman of the Campaign Council and Bayelsa State governor, Diri Douye; Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed; Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, Akwa Ibom state governor, Udom Emmanuel and Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri. Incidentally, they are all members of the 128-man campaign council.\n\nIndications that the majority of the governors are not happy with Atiku and the PDP came to the fore last week as the Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, in a television interview said that Wike and his supporters deserve an explanation from Atiku on why he was not chosen as the party\u2019s vice presidential candidate.\n\nOrtom had said: \u201cI expect him(Atiku) to reach out to Wike, who came second and he denied the popular view of PDP members; 14 out of 17, saying that Wike should be the VP. In his wisdom, he choose that it should be Governor Okowa. Governor Okowa is a nice man. I have no problem with him. If we are in a democratic era and 14 people out of 17 say it should be Wike and he in his wisdom gave it to Okowa, I expect more explanations. I expect him to talk to Wike first, that we are supporting. I expect him to even reach out to some of us. So that together we can work as a party.\u201d\n\nA member of the House of Representatives from Rivers State, Solomon Bob, told Sunday Sun in a telephone interview, that Atiku had offered the Rivers State governor the vice presidential slot, immediately after the national convention. He stated that it was surprising that the former vice president would turn round to choose someone else.\n\nBob noted: \u201cA day after the convention, Atiku went to Wike to appeal to him to be his running mate. Wike asked for time to consult. Wike never wanted to become running mate to anyone. Atiku was the one who made the offer to him, after the convention. That was what happened.\n\n\u201cHe ( Wike) consulted. He was persuaded to accept. And he said okay, we can work together. The same man (Atiku) went back on his offer and passed through the party, the party also voted for the person he has made the offer to earlier on. Unknown to anyone else, he (Atiku) had a secret joker in his mind.\n\n\u201cHe was the one who went to him with the offer of a running mate. Wike\u2019s anger is the deception. That is not how things are done. His anger is about the man\u2019s behaviour. No one compelled him to make that offer.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, who expressed fear that the issue if not properly handled will spell doom for the opposition party, advised Atiku to reach out to the Rivers governor and appeal to him.\n\n\u201cIf it is not handled properly, it portends failure in 2023. That is what it portends. Atiku has to come down from his horse. He is not a president yet. He must not forget that. And he is not vying on the platform of the party in power. He is vying on the platform of the opposition. He has to come down from his high horse and enter into concrete agreement with Wike. Beg him. He has to beg Wike.\n\n\u201cWike is the PDP biggest factor, including in the North. He knows that. But for the last minute eleventh hour game they played, Wike would have won the primary. Wike is PDP biggest factor. If Wike leaves PDP today, he is not leaving alone. Wike has capacity to tear PDP from top to bottom. But he is not going to do that. He is a party man. But Atiku has to learn to be humble.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, media aide to Atiku, Paul Ibe, said that the issue of whether or not the PDP presidential candidate asked Wike to be his running mate should not be the issue for now. Ibe stated that the concern of every well-meaning member of the opposition party should be how to wrest power from the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwith the conclusion of the nomination process, every well-meaning member, stakeholders and leader of the PDP should be preoccupied or should be concerned about how the party can move forward, united to be able to wrestle power from the APC. That should be the preoccupation.\n\n\u201cThis argument of who was offered what, should not be the subject for now. It does not serve the interest of the party and it will not serve the interest of Nigerians, who are anxiously looking on the leadership of the PDP be to able to save this party from the ruins of the APC.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ibe said that the former vice president has noted all the complaints by aggrieved members of the party, adding that all the issues would be resolved.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Atiku Abubakar heard them loud and clear. Even before the complaints were made public, His Excellency has started the process of uniting the party. The process of mediation, of engaging. First of all starting with those who contested with him. \u201cHe visited them. He had discussion with them. He has also been in touch with other leaders and stakeholders. It is a continuous engagement. It is not a one off thing. He has upped it since the end of nomination process that had produced grievances in some quarters. All of the issues would be resolved before the 2023 elections. You can be assured of that, \u201c he stated.\n\nHowever, the noose seems to be tightening around the PDP national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, as aggrieved members of the party are accusing him of alleged bias in the process leading to the emergence of the PDP presidential candidate and the running mate.\n\nCritics are quick to point to Ayu\u2019s visit to the Abuja residence of the Sokoto State governor, and his stance that the panel set up to shop for a vice presidential candidate did not in favour any person as evidence of his alleged bias.\n\nThe PDP chairman, a day after the national convention, had visited Tambuwal in company of former Jigawa State governor, Sule Lamido. In a video clip on the visit, Ayu was heard hailing the Sokoto governor as the hero of the convention. In the video clip, which was also shared online, Ayu was seen patting Tambuwal\u2019s back and saying, \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you. You are the hero of the convention.\u201d\n\nBut, the PDP chairman said that the allegation of bias does not hold water as the party gave every aspirant a level playing ground. Ayu, who spoke through his Special Assistant on Communication and Strategy, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said that his visit to Tambuwal\u2019s residence does not remove anything from the credibility and intergrity of the national convention.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhen Dr Ayu became the chairman of the party, he was clear about giving everyone a level playing field. At every forum, he emphasised that the NWC which he leads was going to be very impartial, so that the best candidate emerges in a very transparent manner that doesn\u2019t give room for contentions and misinterpretation. And to a large extent, that was what Dr Iyorchia Ayu did.\n\n\u201cIf you recall the day that our flag bearer was here to address the NWC on his aspiration. And the chairman told him clearly that we have been friends and we have come a long way, but I will not work for you, Mr Atiku Abubakar as an aspirant. But when you win the election, and become our flag bearer, I will market you. I will stand by you. Right now, you are just like any other aspirant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it that the national chairman was partisan. The convention was free, fair, credible and transparent.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t condemn him for describing someone who exercises his freedom (as hero of the convention). What the chairman is alleged to have said does not take away from the transparency, from the integrity and the credibility of the convention.\u201d\n\nImobo-Tswam further stated that it would be unfair for anyone to hold the national chairman responsible for Atiku\u2019s choice of running mate. He said that it was imperative to note that the terms of reference of the panel set to shop for a running mate was not to choose a particular person, but to make recommendations to the presidential candidate, who has the final say.\n\n\u201cI should think that the party asked the panel to recommend three names to the candidate so that he will now shop the person that suits him.\n\n\u201cIf candidate A name was binding, why send three names. People are being unfair to the national chairman, because he is not the candidate. Once a candidate emerges the issue of choosing his running mate, of course, he will consult the caucuses, but the final decision of who runs with him is personal to him. Atiku Abubakar is the candidate of the party. Only him have the final say on who runs with him. Not Dr Iyorchia Ayu.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Sunday Sun gathered that the aggrieved party leaders are unrelenting in their quest to sack Ayu as party chairman. Those behind the plot, it was gathered, had met severally in Abuja, last week, to perfect their plots. A party source disclosed that one of the meetings was held in Asokoro last Tuesday night.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cI can confirm to you that there are plots. Meetings are being held. Plans are ongoing to move against him. Once they get the required number, they will pass a vote of no confidence in him.\n\n\u201cMost of the NWC members are not happy the way he (Ayu) handled the vice presidential candidate issue. After eminent persons voted in favour of Wike. They want to implode the party. And it is not good for us.\u201d",

          "text": "By By Enyeribe Ejiogu, Olakunle Olafioye, Daniel Kanu (Lagos), John Adams (Minna), Paul Osuyi (Asaba), Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki), Tony Osauzo and Ighomuaye Lucky (Benin), Sylvanus Viashima (Jalingo), Noah Ebije (Kaduna), Rose Ejembi (Makurdi), Stanley Uzoaru (Owerri) and Okey Sampson (Umuahia)\n\nThe dust raised by the call of the Zamfara State governor, Dr Bello Matawalle, on the residents of the state to acquire arms to defend themselves against \u201cbandits\u201d that have besieged communities across the state is still swirling and may not settle anytime soon.\n\nThe governor\u2019s call, a seeming last ditch effort, struck a chord that resonated in the mid of the people of Benue, who for long had been at the receiving end of the murderous bandits, who have turned the whole communities into fields of blood as they killed men, women, children and even slitting the tummies of pregnant women, as well as burning houses, destroying farmlands, sacking the communities and turning the residents into internal refugees.\n\nFor Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, Matawalle\u2019s call was essentially an adoption of the Benue option, when in 2019 he advised residents of the state to defend themselves against armed invaders.\n\nOrtom had at a recent interaction with journalists in Makurdi renewed the call on the people of the state to get arms and be ready to defend themselves against any form of violent hostilities.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe renewed killings and attack will not stop us from doing the right thing. We are not against anybody. But this intimidation must stop. I already told my people to arm themselves because the Bible also allows us to defend ourselves. And those who kill by the sword should die by the sword. Those who kill by AK-47 or whatever means, should also die by AK47.\n\n\u201cI have told my people, don\u2019t waste your time, don\u2019t wait for anybody to kill you, kill that person first. That\u2019s is my stand.\u201d\n\nAlso, both the President General of Tiv Socio-Cultural Organisation, Mzough-U-Tiv (MUT) Worldwide, Chief Iorbee Ihagh (rtd CP) as well as the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Benue State chapter, Rev. Akpen Leva have severally called on the people of the state to defend themselves against gunmen who have consistently invaded their territories.\n\nThey urged the people that rather than run away from their attackers who come to kill, maim and destroy their ancestral homes, they should adequately arm themselves enough to be able to face them instead.\n\nA security expert, Mr Paul Elimbi, characterised the directive of Matawalle to Zamfara people in this way: \u201cWhen a governor makes such statement, it means he has lost faith in the system which constitutionally has the duty and function to protect the people. That means the system has failed. Secondly, it means the world of crime is having an upper hand. It shows that the government is bereft of creativity and initiative to deal with the situation.\n\n\u201cThird, so many people will be sent to early graves because they are not well equipped to handle such situation due to government\u2019s helplessness. The governor is indirectly telling the people that he could not help them, therefore, they should help themselves. It means the government has failed. But when you tell the people to get their own weapons and protect themselves against criminal elements that to me, amounts to further encouraging lawlessness. The state governor, by such pronouncement is institutionalizing disorder and criminality. This goes to show that the government has lost its initiative and it\u2019s helpless.\u201d\n\nThough the position of the Edo State government is that it would not follow the example of Zamfara and Benue states, notable voices in the state have dismissed the state government\u2019s seeming display of the attitude of the ostrich, which pretends to hide its head in the sand.\n\nSpeaking in Benin, acting governor of Edo State, Comrade Philip Shaibu, reiterated that the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, had clarified that only the Federal Government has the authority to grant licences for firearms, adding that the matter is on the Exclusive List of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHe said that Nigeria is not the United States where every state can legislate on firearms, adding that until the National Assembly tinkers with the law the matter remains on the Exclusive List.\n\nShaibu, while noting that insecurity across the country was worrisome, said that the nation cannot become a place where every individual is allowed to carry arms, which at the end of the day would be difficult to control.\n\nHowever, Bishop Dr Osadolor Ochei, immediate past interim chairman, Edo Civil Society Organizations (EDOCSO), countered the view of the state government, saying that the call by the Zamfara State governor that Nigerians should buy guns to defend themselves was a welcome development, adding that even in the Bible people were asked to sell their garments to buy swords, to defend themselves.\n\nOchei explained: \u201cWell, insecurity in the country has overwhelmed the Federal Government and government has failed monumentally and the only answer to the problem is individuals and citizens of this country taking up arms to defend themselves. Life is sacred and it is given to man by God that nobody should take another man\u2019s life except by judgment of a competent court.\n\n\u201cNow that impunity is the order of the day, and some tribes and certain persons have taken it upon themselves that the authority to kill belongs to them, it is my own personal opinion that Nigerians should rise up to defend themselves as the governor of Zamfara said the other day.\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes a man to defend himself, it is a right that cannot be denied. Number one, as a bishop and a Christian, Jesus told us to have a sword and if you don\u2019t have, sell your garment to buy one. You don\u2019t use sword to open the Bible, it is for a day like this that we have in Nigeria, that if there is confrontation, the first right is to defend yourself so that nobody else will kill you.\n\n\u201cNow, if certain persons say they have the monopoly to own a gun without license, and they can brandish it anywhere, kill, kidnap, destroy property and nobody in government challenges them, I am saying that Nigerians should go and look for gun and buy. If you can\u2019t afford it, go and buy cutlass, go and buy axe, go and buy whatever even if it is blade, to defend yourself. I am saying Nigerians are entitled to have it for self-defence. I want to see how the president will arrest about 100 million of us that have guns and put us in correctional centres.\n\nAgain gunmen invade, bomb Kogi poli... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Again gunmen invade, bomb Kogi police station, kill one officer\n\n\u201cThe house he is going to build to arrest and keep Nigerians because we bought guns to defend ourselves, he should go and start building it now because the ones that are doing it, he has not built any and none of those so-called bandits or Boko Haram or ISWAP have been arrested and prosecuted. If you arrest any of them today, they will send message from Abuja, transfer the person arrested to Abuja and that is the end of the story.\n\n\u201cSo, the government has responsibility for securing of our lives and property, instead of protecting our lives and property, government is the one sponsoring killing, maiming, kidnapping and raping in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAnother respondent, Bevy Efe, said that Nigerians must rise up to defend themselves, noting that nobody has monopoly of violence.\n\nJust like Bishop Ochei, a community leader in Birnin Gwari emirate, Kaduna State, Alhaji Zubairu Idris Abdulra\u2019uf, welcomed the directive by the Zamfara State governor to his people, disclosing that already the people of his emirate have adopted that option.\n\nAbdulrra\u2019uf lamented that the incessant attacks on his people had completely paralysed economic activities in their rural communities and made travelling in the area so difficult or even impossible in some places.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have reached the point of no return. People are being pushed to the wall. Just recently, Randegi is one of the areas where these bandits go through to get to Zamfara State and Niger State.\n\n\u201cThe people of Randegi confronted the bandits who tried to overrun the farming community, and they succeeded in dislodging the bandits. So, I think our people are now ready, if the government cannot perform its constitutional function. When people are frustrated, they will look for the best option for themselves, which is to arm themselves if the government cannot protect them.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a situation where people can no longer work or even travel one kilometre from Birnin Gwari town to other areas and it is the same thing that we have in all the districts in Birnin Gwari. If something is not done, we are going to have food crisis. Birnin-Gwari used to produce at least 700 metric tons of assorted grains, but now people cannot access their farms. There are many cases, since the beginning of this rainy season, of people being abducted on their way to the farm and even the cattle they used for farming are being taken from them.\u201d\n\nThough the Kaduna State government has kept mute over Matawalle\u2019s call, a group, the Concerned Northern Forum (CNF) urged the Zamfara governor to re-examine his position on the issue of residents bearing arms for self-defence.\n\nChairman of the group, Abdulsalam Kazeem, expressed worry that arms bearing by citizens may lead to more problems.\n\nGiving reasons for the position of the group, Kazeem said: \u201cWe are not against self-defence, but we can\u2019t support the decision directing civilians to bear arms themselves, because we are all witnesses to the inability of developed countries with accurate data at all levels with such policies and their inability to stop the consequences of gun violence.\n\n\u201cWe as a Forum and one of the leading voices of our region sympathise with the government and people of Zamfara State over the current spate of insecurity and the untold hardship the said situation caused them despite their loyalty to constituted authorities.\n\n\u201cAccording to Fire Arms Act, private citizens are only licenced to acquire pump action and shotguns, so how can a farmer in Zamfara State defend him self against terrorists with GPMG, anti-aircraft and AK 47? Who will train the farmers after acquiring such arms, what is the capacity of our training ranges nationwide and who will be responsible for the training? And at what point will Zamfara State government retrieve all the said guns licensed to them? These are too many questions begging for answers.\u201d\n\nThe group, therefore, appealed to the Federal Government to deploy more security personnel to Zamfara State, \u201cin order to empower local vigilante groups as we believe it will help in local intelligence gathering and our security agencies should be properly empowered, which in return will bring about efficiency, effectiveness and timely results that will stand the challenge of time.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Colonel Dan Amuta (Rtd), who runs a private security agency, agreed with the position of Kazeem\u2019s CNF, arguing that the acquisition of weapons must be centrally controlled or it would lead to lawlessness.\n\nHe said that the call by Matawale was a mistake as things must follow the right process.\n\nHis words: \u201cThere is what we call centralized control. Issues that have bearing with arms and ammunition, weaponry must be centrally controlled. You cannot call out individuals to be armed because it will result to lawlessness.\n\n\u201cThe statement by the Governor of Zamfara to me is simply a mistake. It is out of place to call for everybody to be armed. That is not possible. At the federal level, government will never accept it.\u201d\n\nAlso another security expert, Clement Nssien, differed as he told Sunday Sun that the issue was beyond tolerance as the people\u2019s patience had expired.\n\nHe said there was no government in Nigeria any longer and the truth is for the people to defend themselves if they must be alive.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that we have no government in Nigeria any longer given what we are witnessing and the people must take their fate in their hands. Some people are talking legally and quoting the constitution while the people are dying. They argue that Matawale has no right for such action and I ask: is it when his citizens are all dead that the Federal Government will sit-up to its responsibility? The call for self-defence is inevitable now.\n\n\u201cI hear the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Lucky Irabor saying that the AGF should tell Nigerians if Bello Matawale has the powers to give such order. Is it when all Nigerians are dead that the army, police and other security agencies Irabor is talking about will wake up to their job? I can tell you for free that this directive will be a precursor of what will happen in other parts of the country soon. The people are left with no other alternative, but to resort to self-help, nobody depends on the security forces/agencies any longer.\u201d\n\nIn his view, the Director General of the Institute of Security, Nigeria, ISN, at the University of Lagos, Adebayo Akinade, a lawyer, said that Matawale gave the order as a result of frustration at the moment.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government has failed to provide security for the citizenry, any other means is okay. So, the governor obviously gave the order in frustration. If the Federal Government had provided adequate security, there would be no need for Governor Matawalle\u2019s order. The order was the only option open to the governor in the circumstance he found himself. This is not the time to be talking about law because we are already in a bad and lawless situation. The Federal Government should be up and doing.\u201d\n\nWhile also reacting to the issue, Mrs Cynthia Nkemdi, a security consultant told Sunday Sun that what Matawale proposed was no longer new as most Nigerians are already obtaining arms legally and illegally for self-defense.\n\n\u201cI align myself to the position of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on this issue. The inability of the government to provide security had made the people conscious of the need for self-defence and to develop their private security plans. Even if Matawale did not say it, individuals are now obtaining guns themselves against the attacks of terrorists and bandits. The precarious security situation has left many with no choice than to acquire guns for self-protection and they are not making noise about it.\u201d\n\nIn Niger State, All Progressive Congress (APC) chieftain and former Commissioner for Information, Culture and Touris, Mr Jonathan Vatsa, threw his weight behind Matawalle, saying that the need for people to arm themselves for self-defence is long overdue.\n\nThe former state publicity secretary of the ruling party said that the security agents have failed in their primary responsibility, which is to protect the people as evidenced in the daily massacre of innocent Nigerians, especially in the northern parts of the country.\n\nVatsa said that the governor must have spoken out of frustration over the daily massacre of his people, stressing that no responsible government could watch the people being killed with reckless abandon, adding that the number of innocent Nigerians that have been killed by terrorists in the country since 2015 to date is more than the number of Nigerians that die in civil casualties.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the government has failed in its primary responsibility to the citizen. There is no security anywhere in the country, people are being killed without help from anywhere and you said they should not defend themselves. People are not safe on the road, in their houses or in their farms.\n\n\u201cNobody needs to tell you that you need to protect yourself. The governor does not need to announce it, it is high time for Nigerians to defend themselves against these agents of darkness taking over everywhere in the country.\n\n\u201cThese terrorists have practically changed the lifestyle of Nigerians. Children are not safe in the boarding schools, farmers can\u2019t go to their farms. People are being abducted without any attempt to rescue them by the government that is saying you cannot defend yourself.\n\n\u201cThe victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attacks are still with the terrorists in the bush for over three months now and many more others as if there is no government in the country. What exactly does the government want Nigerians to do, to fold their hands and allow themselves to be killed like animals?\n\n\u201cIf the government is against people defending themselves against these criminals then there is an agenda behind the whole insecurity in the country because the government cannot say it doesn\u2019t have solution to all these madness.\u201d\n\nVatsa cited the attack at the Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State as a clear example of why Nigerians should defend themselves, stressing: \u201cIf the terrorists knew that the worshippers were carrying guns in the church, they wouldn\u2019t have carried out the attack because it would have been fire for fire.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the orgy of killings by terrorists tagged bandits, Delta State government has expressed its commitment to ensure the security and safety of residents in the state.\n\nDespite pockets of attacks in parts of the state, the government assured that the situation would not be allowed to escalate to the level where residents would resort to self-help to protect themselves against criminal elements.\n\nSpeaking with Sunday Sun in Asaba, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, Olisa Ifeajika, said that his boss would not even contemplate giving such advice to residents in Delta State, insisting that it was not constitutional.\n\nIfeajika stated that security situation in Delta would not be allowed to deteriorate to the level where those saddled with the responsibility of protecting lives would be overwhelmed and get frustrated with the system.\n\nHe said that the outcry by the Zamfara governor resulted from frustration, seeing that his efforts at addressing security challenges in that state were not yielding the desired results.\n\nIfeajika noted that the security situation was peculiar to Zamfara to have warranted such advice from the state chief executive.\n\nAccording to him, people have been talking about citizens bearing arms as insecurity keeps worsening in parts of the country, adding that the Zamfara governor only added his voice to it in desperate bid to draw focused attention of concerned authorities to the situation and save lives in that state.\n\nIfeajika stated that the advice also reinforced the call for state police so that state governments would be able to squarely deal with peculiar security threats in their areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Ebonyi State, Aliyu Garba, has affirmed that the Command would not support any directive to issue gun licences to citizens of the state for the purpose of self-defense.\n\nHe explained that despite the increasing level of insecurity that it would be counter-productive to give guns to citizens indiscriminately. He argued that such self-defense mechanism should not be contemplated not only in Ebonyi State, but in the entire country given the temperaments of many of the citizens.\n\nGarba opined that people of the state would be killing themselves daily if they were allowed to carry guns around.\n\nHe explained that the idea of gun licensing is not good for the Nigerian environment given the level of distrust, anger and bitterness in the country.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have not received such directive from the Ebonyi State government. It is not even a good idea because Ebonyi people will be killing themselves on daily basis if they are given guns for self-defense. People that are looking for something and they hadn\u2019t seen it. Now, the thing is at their beck and call? They will be killing themselves. Everyday, they are carrying cutlasses and killing themselves at any slightest provocation. What would happen when they are allowed to carry guns? Even the Americans are coming up with measures to stop their citizens from carrying guns and we are here talking about allowing people carry guns. You are giving African man gun for self-defense? I\u2019m telling you, just mere provocation, he would enter the room, carry it and fire.\u201d\n\nUpcountry in Taraba State, Governor Darius Ishaku differed from the Matawalle\u2019s position.\n\nHe said that rather than asking citizens to acquire weapons to defend themselves against terrorists, the Federal Government should support the various state governments to empower their local security establishments to tackle the menace more holistically.\n\nThe governor who spoke through his media aide, Mr Bala Dan Abu, recalled that the former Minister of Defense, General Theophilus Danjuma (rtd) had made the call earlier for the people to rise up and defend themselves since the security agencies had failed in their responsibility to protect lives and property of the people.\n\nHe, however, noted that security is too delicate to be left in the hands of the people and described the calls for citizens to arm themselves as desperate last resort as a result of how frustrating it could be for a leader to watch his people die needlessly.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we would rather insist that the Federal Government should support the various states to enable them empower their various security establishments to tackle the menace of terrorism.\n\n\u201cIn Taraba State, we have the Taraba Marshalls that was set up by the state government for this purpose. Unfortunately, the Federal Government spent a lot of time doing everything to frustrate the smooth take off of the security outfit. It is only now that we are putting it together to commence operation fully, but there is still the issue of funding.\n\n\u201cSo, I will rather ask the Federal Government to empower and support the states to arm their local security establishments to address their peculiar security challenges. The thing is that, even if you ask the people to arm themselves, how many people can actually afford to acquire the sophisticated weapons that these terrorists use to match their firepower,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, former military administrator of Delta State, Air Commodore Luke Ochulor (rtd), said that the call by Zamfara State governor on its citizens to take up arms and defend themselves would worsen the situation and breed anarchy.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou can\u2019t solve a problem with a problem, even the military wants to reduce the license of those who are having it. That\u2019s not the way to solve the problem, best way to solve the problem in Zamfara is to give a leeway to the military and encourage them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the traditional Prime Minster of Ndegwu community in Owerri West Local Government Area of Imo State who also doubles as the Chairman of Association of Imo State Indigenous Town Unions, Samson Ogbos, corroborated Ochulor\u2019s views.\n\nHe said: \u201cAllowing people over here to carry arms will degenerate to a state of lawlessness. It would be bastardised such that at the slightest provocation you will see a neighbour shooting his fellow neighbour; even some family members will shoot one another.\u201d\n\nIn Abia State, the position of government officials and opinion leaders leaders are that liberalizing the carrying of arms would not in any way curb insecurity in the state, arguing that it would rather escalate it.\n\nTheir belief was that liberalizing the possession of arms could make such weapons end up in wrong hands, and then used by such individuals to unleash mayhem on the society and the people would be worse for it.\n\nThough Abia State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Eze Chikamnanyo, could not be reached to speak on the government\u2019s position, a senior official of the Ministry told Sunday Sun that only the state governor could speak on the issue, given its sensitive nature.\n\nHe, however, suggested that the state government could strengthen her security outfits, including the Bakassi Boys, Homeland Security and Ebubeagu.\n\nUde Okoro, an official of the Landlord\u2019s Association in Abia did not think along the line of arming residents as a way of curbing insecurity in the state.\n\n\u201cAdvocating the arming of residents as a means of checkmating insecurity in the state, will not in any way be the panacea for curbing insecurity in Abia.\n\n\u201cLook at what happened during electioneering period in the past, when some politicians armed thugs to help them win election and after the elections, the thugs ended up using the said guns to terrorize the citizens.\n\n\u201cSo, if that was the case, then come to think of when everybody is allowed to have a gun, hell will be let loose, there will be anarchy everywhere\u201d, Okoro said.\n\nA community leader, Ibe Onyeaku, equally agreed with Okoro\u2019s view of liberalising arms should not be allowed, saying, \u201cNigeria has not got to the level where the advanced climes are operating, and joining them to liberalize carrying of arms, will spell doom for the state and the country.\u201d",
          "summary": "For Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, Matawalle\u2019s call was essentially an adoption of the Benue option, when in 2019 he advised residents of the state to defend themselves against armed invaders.\nThe state governor, by such pronouncement is institutionalizing disorder and criminality.\nJust recently, Randegi is one of the areas where these bandits go through to get to Zamfara State and Niger State.\nAnd at what point will Zamfara State government retrieve all the said guns licensed to them?\nI\u2019m telling you, just mere provocation, he would enter the room, carry it and fire.\u201dUpcountry in Taraba State, Governor Darius Ishaku differed from the Matawalle\u2019s position.",

          "title": "Why Kwankwaso/Obi alliance talk is stalled \u2013Senator Rufai Hanga",
          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen\n\nSenator Rufai Hanga is one of the leading members of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in Kano State. In this interview, he gave an insight into what may likely be the outcome of the 2023 presidential poll, postulating the possibility of a rerun.\n\nThe 2023 presidential contest is getting increasingly exciting by the day. Would you say that the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) genuinely represents the Third Force people have been yearning for?\n\nThat is the Third Force people have been expecting. You know I spoke about it a long time ago before that a Third Force might come and that when it comes it will be a miracle. To me, it is already a miracle. It is not a newly registered party, it was registered about 20 years ago and nobody ever heard about it. But the moment we adopted it in less than two months, it has spread to nooks and crannies of the country and it is still spreading and growing. We have so many things that assured us of winning the coming presidential election.\n\nHow would you then account for its acceptance in such a speedy manner?\n\nIt is because people are tired of APC and PDP. There is nothing you can tell responsible, well-meaning Nigerians who care about the situation in the country-insecurity, poverty, unemployment, collapse of education, economic downturn and so many other things \u2013 about APC and PDP that they will listen to you. People discarded the PDP because of its abysmal performance and embraced APC. Now, the APC has even performed worse than PDP. So, it is difficult to trust any of the two parties anymore. In the midst of this situation, definitely, people will want to experiment, especially knowing that the people who formed the NNPP are people of impeccable character. That is the reason people embraced it.\n\nIf NNPP has been registered over 20 years ago as you said, why has it remained underground?\n\nFulani group picks APC nomination f... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Fulani group picks APC nomination forms for Jonathan\n\nIt has been there for a long time like Accord Party and so many others. You know that some parties that had no appreciable showing had been deregistered by the INEC, but NNPP remained afloat because it managed to win a seat in Bauchi. Somebody won a seat in the Bauchi State House of Assembly on the platform of the NNPP and that is why it remains afloat. There are some other parties too that have some pockets of seats here and there, but they are not as popular as NNPP.\n\nWho were the brains behind its formation?\n\nThe brain behind it is one Chief from Anambra, Dr Boniface Okechukwu. He was the person who registered it. He is not a full-time politician; he is a businessman in Lagos. He came and handed over the party to us with Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso as the National Leader and the presidential candidate, while he (Dr Okechukwu) is now the Chairman, Board of Trustees (BOT) of the party.\n\nHow would you convince the electorate that NNPP represents a clean break from the past since most of the leading members like you had one time or the other dined and wined with the two leading parties?\n\nThe difference is that most of the people that formed NNPP are the people that have been ostracised by the APC and PDP because they are not comfortable with the ideologies of the two parties. They have had disagreement with them on so many issues and so they had to part with them and form another party. Besides these people, we also have other like-minds, who have not been in politics before, but are now coming into the fold. There are lots of professors in the universities, some civil servants and businessmen who have been watching the happenings in the country. We encouraged them to come into politics and a lot of them have answered the call and they are coming to embrace the party. Most of them are fresh politicians who are coming together to salvage the situation and rescue the nation. So, it is not going to be business as usual.\n\nThere is a lot of rhetoric here. In specific terms, what are you going to do differently if you are given the opportunity to lead the country?\n\nWe are bringing on board integrity, we are bringing on board openness, level playing field, equal opportunity, fairness, equity and justice. That is why we adopted New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). We want a new Nigeria where people are equal, where there is fairness, where there is equity, where people will have a say in what affects them.\n\nYou mentioned integrity. But in governance, integrity is like a promissory note. You recall that President Muhammadu Buhari came on board in 2015 on the crest of integrity. With the current situation of things, do you think anybody can sway the voters with rhetoric of integrity?\n\nPeople embraced Buhari because they thought he can do it. But we are bringing on board people who have already done it and we are sure they will do it again. That is the difference. Even when Buhari had the opportunity to do it, he was not the main player; he was just a figure head. He was not the actual actor. People in NNPP are the actual actors and that is why we are sure we are bringing integrity because these are people with proven competence.\n\nCan you now boast that the party will have a stronghold in the Southeast since the founder is a man from Anambra as you have earlier mentioned?\n\nTo say the truth, the stronghold of the party is not in the Southeast. But it has its roots there and a good followership. The stronghold of the party now is mostly in the North. In the whole of the North, I don\u2019t think there is any state where we don\u2019t have a sizeable followership. I assure you; the party will either come first or second in the whole of the North. In Southern part, there are also states where we will come either first or second. I don\u2019t want to be too ambitious by saying we will come first everywhere in the South. But in the North, I think we will come first in most of the states.\n\nOne would have expected you to seize the opportunity of this auspicious moment to formalize a solid alliance with the Southeast using your fresh idea about a new Nigeria that is evolving as a vehicle. Why isn\u2019t it so?\n\nWe are talking with Peter Obi, but the talk is stalled by some little disagreement on who should be the presidential candidate and the running mate. Otherwise, it would have been consummated. We have issues, but not too serious. I hope we will later on agree. Peter Obi people want him to be the presidential candidate, and we want Kwankwaso to be the presidential candidate. Somebody who brings more food on the table is supposed to be the candidate. On our part, we think Kwankwaso will bring more food on the table because going by qualification and experience, Kwankwaso is more experienced. Peter Obi too is qualified educationally, but Kwankwaso is an Engineer and a PhD holder, who has worked in several capacities as a two-term governor in Kano State, as deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, as a member of constitutional conference, as an ambassador, as a minister of defence, and as a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In all of these positions, he has performed tremendously well. He succeeded in a lot of assignments he was given as an ambassador. In the constitutional conference, he interacted with a lot of Nigerians from all walks of life and he knows the pulse of the nation. The Senate is also a platform for all Nigerians. Peter Obi is not all that experienced when it comes to governance and he is even a lot younger than Kwankwao. That is why we say Peter Obi should be the running mate for sometimes to learn more under Kwankwaso and then takeover after Kwankwaso must have finished his terms. But simply because of sentiment about power shift, they don\u2019t want to agree. Peter Obi has just joined the Labour Party; he doesn\u2019t have the structure in the party. I don\u2019t think there is a state in the North where Labour Party has a gubernatorial candidate, where they have local government chairmen, where they have members of state and National Assembly. But we have them all over the place in the country. So, how can he come and ask Kwankwaso to come and be his running mate simply because of the sentiment about power shift to the Southeast? It is wrong, it is unfair, it is unjust. If only Peter Obi and his people will agree with us, we can go along together and have an alliance. But if they don\u2019t, there are many other people who are coming forward to be the running mate. We will choose a credible candidate among them. Certainly, Peter Obi is a man of integrity, very intelligent, sound in economy and business. He will be of help in the position of Vice President because he will be the chairman of Economic Council. If he can come down to be running mate, it will be fine. In a matter of days, you will hear from us because we have not finalized our discussion. We have a lot of credible people on the queue to take it.\n\nIt is also in the news that APC has approached your party for an alliance. How far have you gone on that too?\n\nWe are not engaged in any merger talk with either APC or PDP, but they have both approached us. They want our co-operation; they want us to go together. How is that possible? Let me give you an example, we have candidates for all positions in Kano, Jigawa, Katsina. But PDP does not have candidates for all positions in Kano; it does not have candidates for all positions in Jigawa and Katsina states because people are not interested in the tickets. They know they won\u2019t win. Even in Kano, people know they will waste their money if they pick the tickets of the PDP. Despite the propaganda that they are going to win the election, people didn\u2019t buy their forms. How do you expect us to go along with PDP when they don\u2019t have candidates? We can lay claim to the whole of the North and some pockets of states in the South. Even in the Southwest, we have a very strong support in Oyo and Ogun states. We have strong support in Delta, Akwa Ibom states and some other states in the South-south. None of these three parties can alone secure 2/3 majority votes. There will be a rerun. And that is where alliance will come into play to secure a simple majority required by the constitution. This is what we are counting on. The question of APC winning does not arise. It won\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t see APC winning anywhere in the North other than Borno and Yobe where they will write the votes.\n\nAre you saying that you still don\u2019t have confidence in the INEC despite the perceived improvement in its performance in the recent elections in Ekiti and Anambra states?\n\nThey don\u2019t do election in Borno and Yobe, they only write results there. The performance of INEC is improving, but there is nothing they can do in Borno and Yobe. There was Boko Haram in Borno and Yobe when we had the previous elections. More than 12 local governments were in the hands of Boko Haram. Yet, they produced impossible results in Borno. Where did they get the results? Who came out to vote? How would they have voted when people were there in IDP camps and Cameroun? So, they must have written the results.\n\nWith electronic transmission of results, do you think that is still possible?\n\nLet\u2019s wait and see.",

          "title": "CONVERSATION WITH MY BILLIONAIRE FRIEND \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "\n\nSESSION 22\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY AND WEALTH BUILDING\n\nShortly after our conversation last week, my Billionaire Friend hinted he would like to share his thoughts on national security and its impact on wealth-building endeavours. He believes very strongly that wealth-building practices can only thrive in an atmosphere of safety and good security.\n\nKindly enjoy the rest of his insightful perspective:\n\nWealth and National Security\n\n\u201cNational security is essential to wealth building and sustenance because wealth creation only thrives in peaceful environments and nations. It relates to direct threats to the physical well-being of the population and jeopardises the stability of a country, its economy and institutions. National security threats could show up in incidents of hostile government takeover \u2014terrorism, the proliferation of weaponry and stockpiling of chemical weapons \u2014 which can destroy any nation\u2019s security. It also includes cybercrime and the infiltration by hostile governments and terrorist groups. Cybercriminals have hacked economic institutions, government websites, private bank accounts and national power infrastructures. National security could also be adversely affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and the likes of Covid-19 pandemic recent occurrence. National security is therefore crucial for providing a conducive environment for the funding or hindrance of wealth creation, building and sustenance\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s and the 1970s, some years before and after the Nigerian Civil War, national security was well managed and the country was peaceful. There was no banditry, no terrorism of the herdsmen and Boko Haram, and the rate of crime was low. But today insecurity is pervasive and has endangered the investment climate of Nigeria. This bad national security situation hinders economic growth and development and decreases the attraction, retention and sustenance of foreign and local investments\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe progressive atrophy of foreign investments and businesses of various forms in Nigeria is due to the prevalence of unpredictable security situations over the years. As it is now, the general perception is that wealth owners and builders are increasingly afraid to move from one place to the other in Nigeria. This perception of fear has become a problem for wealth-building endeavours which inherently thrive on peace and free mobility. Generally, wealth creation and building are fragile human activities. Wealth building does not survive well in environments of war and where banditry, kidnapping and terrorism prevail. There is, therefore, the need to re-evaluate and arrest our different national security threats to improve, significantly, the generally poor perception of Nigeria as a wealth-building destination\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe may want to look at cyber or financial crimes, for instance, and the seeming ineffectiveness of the arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators of such. Wealth builders may thus encounter such problems in the processing of bank transfers. A large number of incidents of hacking into the private accounts of wealth builders/owners have occurred and awaiting prosecution. These breaches do happen in other climes, but the problem here is the extent of ensuring that the perpetrators of these crimes are detected, sanctioned and prosecuted\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe problem is thus not in the prevalence but in the extent to which we react and how fast and well we ensure that those who perpetrate these crimes against national security are dealt with appropriately, to ensure that national economic growth and development are not unduly hindered\u201d.\n\n\u201cNational security is not only limited to the threats of terrorism,\n\nbanditry and financial crimes. Cyber terrorism also creates national security problems against the economic growth of many countries of the world. In India, for instance, a group of human rights activists were targeted by terrorists, who infected their computers with malware. Suspected North Korean hackers also compromised two prominent European defence firms, thus sending them fake job offers as a way to infiltrate their systems and retrieve classified information. These are just two examples of criminals using hacking and other digital skills to cause destruction and chaos\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important for governments to put national security and emergency responses in place, to allow them to identify and thwart human-made destructions to national peace and stability, which would go a long way in promoting business and wealth-building activities. Nigeria is currently witnessing several violent attacks, kidnapping, banditry, farmland invasion by herdsmen, and inter-communal tensions, leading to outbreaks of violence and disruption of economic activities and wealth building. The outcome of all this is the high rate of unemployment in Nigeria and its attendant effect on social tensions and strive. Domestic capital formation is also hindered, and foreign direct investments are affected. Meanwhile, government spending on education and security is low, which has negatively affected the level of security and retard national economic growth\u201d.\n\n\u201cDespite government efforts and expenditure, the prevalence of state insecurity appears to continue, remains largely un-curtailed and is fast evolving into a state existential crisis, which is shaking the very foundation of Nigeria and its economic growth\u201d.\n\n\u201cAvailable data from 2009 to 2019, indicates growing unemployment rates, declining domestic capital formation, the flight of foreign direct investments, increasing government security expenses and the likes, which are conversely affecting the provision of welfare and health services, equitable income distribution and the productive use of public borrowing.\n\nCompounding all these problems is the issue of the federal government\u2019s inability to protect the national, state and local economies against corruption which is greatly dampening national economic growth in the short run\u201d.\n\n\u201cThus, Nigerian government\u2019s inability to provide a safe and secure environment for human capital development largely adversely affects wealth-builders and access to social and economic services as necessary ingredients for wealth building and sustenance. There is also a huge inability to create jobs, eradicate poverty, and improve government revenue for engendering long-term inclusive economic growth. Some folks may argue that this whole scenario of national security in Nigeria is all about perception as away from facts and reality on the ground. And that there is a need to balance perception with concrete facts. They would argue that this negative perception of Nigeria\u2019s insecurity does not necessarily reflect the facts on the ground\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, facts are sacred. We must be conscious that balancing the investment climate with wealth building is very fragile. Nigeria is globally not currently rated as a safe investment destination, given all that has been earlier mentioned here\u201d.\n\nConsider these\n\n\u201cJoint security patrols of the geographical locations of wealth builders\u2019 businesses need to be organised for the communal protection of wealth owners\u2019 assets, within their areas of operation. Such joint security patrols should necessarily incorporate the assistance of the Nigerian Police. These patrols should have links with the command systems of the Nigerian Police to ensure business concerns of wealth owners are not adversely affected by the pervasive insecurity of the Nigerian environment\u201d.\n\nIt is not for anything that one is very much concerned about the importance of national security for wealth builders, because security, energy and human capital form the crux of business development which is the prime focus of wealth owners. Wealth owners hoping to do business in unsafe environments need to consider all these. Wealth cannot be built optimally in largely unsafe environments because of the survival, productivity and profitability impacts on the business, production and investment of wealth owners\u201d.\n\nOptions for Wealth Builders\n\n\u201cOne way is for wealth builders to always be pre-emptive, to insulate themselves strategically from the impacts earlier mentioned, by employing insurance policies to reduce the probable losses that may occur, as a result of some of the issues of insecurity already mentioned here. An example is taking cash movement, special peril, fire, and fidelity insurance by such wealth builders. Another example is employing the services of private security agencies, using hidden cameras to record goings and comings, with support command stations for their businesses in different locations, to monitor and take appropriate pre-emptive actions against possible adversities. Another proactive strategy is to always obtain expert advice on law and security, to mitigate the outcomes of such national and local insecurities. Wealth builders must also ensure that they conduct proper investigations of their intended employees, by using expert personnel recruitment, security agencies and experts to shortlist intending personnel for employment in their wealth-building operations. In addition to this, they must keep proper records of thumbprints, and passport photos and where possible, they must register the same with the police commands around their various localities. This is necessary. Personnel should also be notified and made aware that such police notification measures have been put in place against possible abuse by personnel. A way out again is for wealth owners to make it a duty to be aware at all times of the developments and movements around their businesses by regularly monitoring news around their localities to be fully aware of happenings and likely security breaches around their businesses\u201d.\n\nThriving in Dark Times\n\n\u201cThus, in general, the sustainability of wealth building by business owners is significantly influenced by the ability of their environment to provide conducive security, effective use of resources and delivery of innovative planning and development strategies for security management. The influence of security conditions arising from the challenges of national and local crises negatively affects business performance\u201d.\n\n\u201cCountries that seriously value the importance of wealth growing, plan and expand to curb the negative effect of avoidable national security crises that may likely occur. Security challenges can usually be prevented with the use of science and technology to prevent or limit the losses from conflicts, crises and impacts on individuals and businesses by adequately avoiding or minimising such risks. Obviously, the production of wealth can only best take place in conducive environments and are usually significantly affected by national security problems. It is therefore the responsibility of governments to ensure that measures are put in place to minimise the adverse effects of national security on national and individual wealth building\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt must be admitted that the problems of national security are universal but the difference between one country and the other, in terms of wealth development, incomes, earning capacity, size/quality of GDP and employment generation capacity, has to do with how effectively and optimally that national security is handled for providing conducive environments. Also of importance is the need for the empowerment of the country\u2019s judiciary, for fast, adequate and unbiased judgments against infractions, and clear and transparent penalties against the perpetrators of security lapses. This is very important because every properly-managed nation is fully aware that lapses in national security can and do occur, which negatively affect growth and development but well-managed nations generally appoint their judges on merit, empower and fund their judiciaries and honour the sanctity of the rule of law. These are necessary ingredients for the growth and development of wealth in well-managed societies and nations\u201d.\n\nThus far\u2026\n\nCan\u2019t wait to catch up with you next week\n\nQUOTE 1\n\nNational security is basic in importance to wealth building and sustenance because wealth creation only thrives in peaceful environments and nations. In itself, national security relates to anything that threatens the physical well-being of the population and jeopardises the stability of the economy of any nation or its institutions.\n\nQUOTE 2\n\nAs it is now, the general perception is that wealth owners and builders are increasingly afraid to move from one place to the other in Nigeria. This perception of fear has become a problem for wealth-building endeavours which inherently thrive on peace and free mobility.",

          "text": "*CSOs berate Buhari\n\nFrancis Sardauna in Katsina\n\n\n\nThe Chairman, Katsina State Traditional Council of Chiefs and Emir of Katsina, Dr. Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, has raised the alarm over what he described as multifaceted worsening security challenges besetting residents of the state.\n\nThe traditional ruler said the spate of insecurity in the state was at the moment deteriorating thereby degenerating the state of affairs with regards to the security of lives and property of the citizenry, particularly in farming communities across the state.\n\nAlso, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the state berated President Muhammadu Buhari and the legislative arm of government over their failure to investigate prevailing security challenges in the North-west despite huge resources spent to curb the scourge in the region.\n\n\n\nUsman, who spoke in Hausa in a two minutes viral video, said some traditional rulers in the state had forfeited their salaries to enable the state government combat banditry in the state.\n\nHe added that the state had literally been overrun by terrorist, bandits, kidnappers, armed robbers, rapists, and other sundry armed criminal gangs who terrorise and kill, abduct and rape innocent citizens indiscriminately in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou will see two or four persons (terrorists) on a bike with live ammunition out to kill anyone they could lay hands on, we all have to stand on our feets. It\u2019s not as if we don\u2019t have the money.\n\n\u201cWe have the money and weapons to fight these people (terrorists). We have even forfeited our salaries so that they can fight insurgency but they don\u2019t. Many emirs have been abducted.\n\n\u201cIt has gotten to the extent that everywhere you go you will be in constant fear of not knowing what may happen. It was just yesterday that I came back from Kaduna, l had to be escorted front and back\u201d.\n\nHe added that: \u201cImagine we and our country living in such fear because of those irresponsible drug addicts. We can tackle them, we have the money and weapons to fight them. Are we afraid of them?.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fold our hands and be killed and have our wives abducted and raped in our presence, it is not fair, so this is my answer\u201d.\n\nCollaborating the emir\u2019s frustration, the Chairman of the Coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the state, AbdulRahman Abdullahi, said with the escalating security challenges in the North-west, the monarch had spoken the minds of his subjects.\n\nHe said the federal and state governments need to devise more proactive and revolving security measures to tackle banditry and other heinous crimes orchestrated by the hoodlums than its current reactive actions.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that, despite huge spendings on security operations in the North-west, the rate of crime is increasing by the day and neither the president nor the legislature cares to probe why\u201d, he added.",

They were said to have targeted defenceless locals mainly young males and opened fire on them at close range and killed dozens. They also wounded and arrested others who are later to be questionably labelled them as \"ESN/IPOB hoodlums\".\n\nVideos and pictures of the massacre which SaharaReporters obtained on Saturday, showed abandoned corpses shot on foreheads, heart regions, stomach and back and penis region littered in one of the community's playground and other locations.\n\nRelatives were equally seen crying besides corpses. Women were also seen carrying the corpses of their husbands on wheelbarrows.\n\nIn some videos, soldiers were seen placing pump action guns on top of some of the citizens killed to probably justify the massacre or their labeling as \"IPOB/ESN\" fighters.\n\nThey were said to have also invaded several of traditional sanctuaries and destroyed them or displayed their symbols to invariably link them to the pro-Biafra group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its security outfit, Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters on the recent development, on Saturday, security analyst who is also Board Chairman of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law otherwise known as Intersociety, Chief Emeka Umeagbalasi, described the killings as a genocide.\n\nUmeagbalasi said \"no doubt that Ogbaru is one of the Anambra Council areas presently under the grip of syndicated criminal entities engaging in several nefarious activities including abductions, killings, armed robberies and ransom demands as well as counterfeiting ESN trademarked modes of operation by attacking security operatives and government facilities.\n\n\"But latest findings by Intersociety showed that the criminal entities are camped inside big river/swamp Forest of Obene-Ochuche/Umuzu/Okija divided by Ulasi River.

Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Covered Up For Ex-Army Chief, Buratai, Failed To Submit Funds To Central Bank, To Secretly Move Cash From Facility\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00pm and 12:00am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\nSee Also Military REVEALED: Identity Of Civil Servant Who Took Bail Of Military Contractor Arrested In Buratai\u2019s Abuja House With Multibillion-Naira Cash, Vehicles, Rolex Watches\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\n'Missing' Arms Funds\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

          "text": "SaharaReporters has exclusively obtained photographs of things including posh vehicles recovered by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) from the house of a former Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd.), being used by a proxy.\n\nThey include pictures of the safe where foreign currencies were recovered, Mercedes Benz 2022, Bulletproof G Wagon (voice customized), recovered from him valued at N150 million and BMW also recovered from him during the execution of a search warrant.\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported how the house was raided last Thursday by ICPC officials, who found over N1 billion and expensive vehicles said to be from funds meant to prosecute the war against Boko Haram.\n\nSaharaReporters on Friday reported that the ICPC confirmed the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items from a military contractor fronting for Buratai.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, disclosed the arrest in a statement on Friday.\n\nOgagua identified the suspect as the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how ICPC officials last Thursday invaded a property in Abuja, recovering cash, vehicles and wrist watches worth billions of naira from a man who said they belonged to Buratai.\n\nBuratai\n\nSources said the anti-graft agency was tipped off about the cash haul by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) during a probe of Kabiru.\n\nSubsequently, the NFIU transferred the matter to ICPC, which deployed its operatives to invade the property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nPHOTONEWS: Safe With Foreign Currencies, Voice-customised Bulletproof G-Wagon Valued N150m, 2022 Mercedes Benz, Others Recovered From Corruption-riddled Former @HQNigerianArmy Chief, Buratai https://t.co/XZetevBImK pic.twitter.com/KEUWPuuZJj \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) July 1, 2022\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the huge cash was part of the billions of Naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cLast week Thursday, ICPC officials stormed a house in Wuse area of Abuja, beside National Open University and arrested a man, Kabiru Salisu (Sallau) after they saw N850 million cash in the house,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Anti-corruption Agency, ICPC Finally Opens Second Box Found In Ex-Army Chief, Buratai's Property, Finds Additional $170,0000, \u00a385,000, \u20ac54,000 Stashed Inside\n\n\u201cHe claimed the money belonged to Tukur Buratai who was in Cotonou at that time.\n\n\u201cOfficials of the ICPC took him to an office where another N1 billion in cash was also discovered. Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Covered Up For Ex-Army Chief, Buratai, Failed To Submit Funds To Central Bank, To Secretly Move Cash From Facility\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00pm and 12:00am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\nSee Also Military REVEALED: Identity Of Civil Servant Who Took Bail Of Military Contractor Arrested In Buratai\u2019s Abuja House With Multibillion-Naira Cash, Vehicles, Rolex Watches\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\n'Missing' Arms Funds\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

Don\u2019t be afraid. Go home and work. Our job is to work; that is why I came. I came to thank you and to urge you to work. All of us are unit leaders; no more local government leaders.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go home and win our units.

But I\u2019ve searched the Bible from cover to cover and there is nowhere in the Bible where God said a child of God cannot defend himself.\n\n\u201cIf you find the place, let me know. He said, \u2018if they slap you on the right cheek, turn the left\u2019. If they now slap the left, what did he say? When God is silent, do you know the meaning of that?

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against Khumbudzo Ntshavheni\u2019s decision to switch off analogue broadcast systems by June 30, 2022, declaring it unconstitutional. Ntshavheni \u2013 who serves as the country\u2019s current Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies \u2013 wants South Africa to migrate to digital broadcast systems.\n\nThis follows an appeal by e.tv and two other applicants, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and SOS Support Public Broadcasting, who sought to overturn a judgment and order of the High Court of South Africa that had ruled in favour of the minister and government earlier this year.\n\nIn 2006, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), of which South Africa is a member, resolved that all member states in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East should migrate from analogue broadcasting systems to digital broadcasting systems by the year 2015.\n\nCurrently, in South Africa, traditional analogue broadcast systems are occupying the frequency bands between 700 MHz and 800 MHz which could be used for mobile data. Digital migration would free up those bands, making the provision of mobile data services cheaper.\n\nTo comply with the ITU resolution, in September 2008, the then minister of communications and digital technologies in South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, published a Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy (BDM Policy) which stated that the analogue switch-off would be on November 1, 2011, 4 years earlier than the ITU\u2019s proposed deadline.\n\nIn February 2021, South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the phased switch-off of analogue transmitters would be completed by the end of March 2022.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the minister made a final call for those qualifying for state-sponsored set-top boxes (STBs) to register, with the deadline for registration set for October 31, 2021. STBs would enable households to continue having access to television channels on their analogue television sets after the analogue switch-off.\n\nAfter this announcement, e.tv brought an application to the High Court against minister Ntshavheni, seeking to prevent the minister from disconnecting millions of people who had not yet migrated to digital transmission.\n\nIn the court order, the applicants wanted the minister to, among other requests, consult all affected parties before determining the analogue switch-off date as well as provide a report on the steps taken to ensure access to STBs within 1 month of the date of the court order.\n\nIn its judgement on March 28, the court had accepted that out of over 14 million television sets in South Africa, 10.5 million were compliant with digital transmission and 3.75 million were analogue.\n\nThe High Court held that 3 months would be sufficient to allow the minister to complete the outstanding installation of STBs in households with analogue television sets.\n\nIn the final ruling, the High Court dismissed the application from e.tv, MMA and SOS but extended the analogue switch-off date to June 30, 2022.\n\nFollowing the ruling by the High Court, e.tv, MMA and SOS appealed the matter against the minister in the Constitutional Court arguing that the Minister had a duty to consult the public, including the applicants, before imposing the STB registration cut-off date and determining the analogue switch-off date.\n\nIn a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court ruled that the power to determine the analogue switch-off date and the registration deadline for STBs is located within the minister\u2019s original constitutional policymaking function. The court thereafter had to determine whether the minister exercised this power rationally and lawfully.\n\nIn that respect, the Constitutional Court held that it was not only irrational but also unlawful for the minister to set a switch-off date without adequate notice to the analogue broadcast providers and the public.\n\nAs to the remedy, the Court held that the decisions of the minister, as well as the order of the High Court, had to be set aside.\n\nThe judgement will further delay South Africa\u2019s migration into digital broadcasting, meaning that services like mobile data which could do with the freed-up space on the frequency spectrum as a result of digital migration will continue to be expensive, further hurting citizens\u2019 pockets.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.\n\nDemocracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.\n\n\u2013 Margee M. Ensign",

          "text": "In a certain land, not faraway, preparations for elections are underway. Feverish excitement and political activities are deafening. Social media totally awash with subtle campaign and endorsement posts. Very young people, sure their world view is the only available route, forcefully drive their narratives. Eight months (February 2023) since a long time away.\n\nStarry-eyed youths, eager to change their country, are in over-drive, confident of victory. Their arguments seem intelligible, rational and best for the country. For too long they\u2019ve been stuck with mediocrity, misgovernance and mismanagement of their future and destiny. They want a new lease of life. They are so excited they won\u2019t take it easy with anyone pointing out obvious stumbling blocks and challenges along the way. They want to see a new day. They seem desperate for change. Good and commendable. But.\n\nFunny enough, they even expect you to join them as they jump up and down in excitement.\n\nThey don\u2019t seem to have the patience to search out how they became woke in the first place. Who and what opened their eyes. Folks who deliberately inspired the awareness in the land today, at great personal cost, and secretly prayed for this day. Are there hidden facts they all could still learn from folks who activated the awareness?\n\nBut the rulers and those who held and still holds the land hostage, seem uncomfortable with the woke generation and for good reason. And the beat goes on.\n\nThe old guard seem all too confident of victory, not because the population are in love with their style of leadership, that brought us here, but simply because they know they are totally and completely in absolute control of all the necessary institutions in the land. They also know that the religious, ethnic and regional divisions, help them manipulate the system to their advantage. So as the breeze of the ongoing political awareness and electoral revival blow noisily all around them, they remain unperturbed, sharing positions and allotting offices to themselves during their pre election nocturnal meetings.\n\nThey seem to live in an entirely different world from the helpless masses of the country. They are the owners of the land. They know they will put pepper into the eyes of the over-excited youths. They know they\u2019ll only begin to take the hyper-aroused youths serious after the February 2023 polls. And prepare to counter and contain them towards 2027 and 2031 polls, all things being equal.\n\nThey know they are absolutely in charge of the security agencies, the armed forces and all allied paramilitary institutions, including the umpire of the polls. They know they have husbanded incredible resources for the battle in February. A battle they see themselves as garlanded and well-decorated veterans. A battle where morality, justice and the good of the land, doesn\u2019t matter. A battle where the winner takes it all.\n\nThey take advantage of the grave poverty and deprivation they afflicted the land with, they know these facts will always work in their favour. The people will cry for a while, loose in the courts and the beat goes on. They\u2019ve not just done it before, they know they\u2019ve done this for decades. They aren\u2019t bothered one bit. They see themselves as masters of the game. Do the excited youngsters have any strategy to contain this?\n\nBetween this unfolding developments and the uncanny reality of a vicious, predatory leadership cabal, lies the likely outcome.\n\nEither the aggrieved long oppressed masses effect desirable change through the ballot box, or the ruthless oppresive cabal continues with their mindless stranglehold on the land, by deploying ethnic, religious and regional divide, intimidation, stomach infrastructure and abuse of institutions as usual. Every citizen\u2019s opinion on this grave matter, bothers on which side of the divide one finds himself.\n\nActivists who have been sounding the alarm for decades that consensual devolution of powers and reverse to true federalism, remains the sensible route to save the land, currently seem unpopular, as everyone seems fixated on campaigns and elections.\n\nThe people strangely believe that votes will count this time around and that the elections will be free and fair. Nobody is interested in studying past developments. Nobody cares about the likely conduct and outcome of the February 2023 polls. All eyes are expectantly on favourable outcome come February 2023. Everybody believes therein lies all the solutions to our miseries as a people.\n\nWhereas a successful ballot box revolution seems desirable and needful, how about the sad and stark realities.\n\nThe agitation that inspired the new consciousness is forgotten. The activists who risked their very lives creating the awareness, are no longer useful. Even their opinion borne out of painful hindsight is hurriedly disregarded, as election frenzy rule the land. The cheap assumption that power will ultimately change hands come 2023, seems to blind the thought and vision of even discerning members of the public.\n\nThe promises of Eldorado both by the old guard and the prospective alternatives, seem clearly unrealistic under the 1999 constitution.\n\nThe uncanny reality that will hit the land after the February 2023 polls juxtaposed against the current unfolding developments will present a course of study in the chequered annals of the land. The falcon can\u2019t hear the falconer.\n\nI gently plead with ye\u2019all, to save this and go through it again next February. My conclusion: We should worry more about the unjust and unkind unitary structure that makes it impossible for the land to thrive. Elections come and go, but the fact that our political structure needs urgent review and revisit remains the incontrovertible truth.\n\nEvangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko is the founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM) and secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA).",

I am talking about internal rancour amongst us. In one, two, three weeks, we will be able to resolve what the issues are. The issues are not about the governorship candidate. I need to sit with them and say, can we move forward.\u201d\n\nReacting to the decision of the Rivers State government to prosecute him over the alleged sales of the state assets, the former Rivers governor declared that neither the police nor any of the anti-graft agencies has invited him for interrogation.\n\nHe said: \u201cI hope that the governor has good lawyers. The Supreme Court said in their judgement that he has powers to set up a panel and the job of the panel is to gather information. That after gathering the information, they should pass the information to either ICPC, Police or EFCC. The police have not invited me; ICPC has not invited me and EFCC has not invited me.\n\n\u201cSecondly, there is what we call fair hearing. At that point when they will invite me, it is called a fair hearing because they will hear my own side of the story. You have not heard my own side of the story and you went to court to do what? Something must be giving you confidence.\n\n\u201cIt is not about being served by the court. The Supreme Court said before you go ahead, you have to send it to the investigating authorities and it is when they finish the investigation that they will decide whether the matter will come to court or not. You have not done any of those things and you are in court. So, what will you be telling the court?\n\n\u201cTwo, everything that was done was done transparently. There was an agency called the Public Procurement Agency and all those things passed through.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be talking about an issue that is before the court. Let the court decide. Tonye Cole did not act in his personal capacity. He represented Sahara Energy. You know this is political because they are afraid.\u201d\n\nHe urged APC members to go and work for the party\u2019s victory, stressing that the election is a contest and one person must emerge victorious.\n\nThe former presidential aspirant defended the Minister-designate, Udi Odum, who is the leader of Abual/Odual local government area, correcting the impression that he was an unpopular candidate.",

          "text": "The Coordinator, Stand Up Nigeria, Sunday Attah, on Saturday berates the action of some oil marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nAttah describe the development as most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits.\n\nThe Coordinator, in his One Day Rally Text on the Lingering Fuel Crisis in FCT and Some other States in Nigeria said, the rally became pertinent in view of the toll the fuel crisis is taking on the economy of Nigeria and the attendant socio-economic effect on citizens.\n\n\u201cQuite unfortunately, queues have resurfaced in many states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, that many are finding it difficult to go about their normal schedule without incurring further costs.\n\nConsequently, Nigerians have expressed outrage at the build up of these queues and the resultant hardship.\n\nWhile the outrage is justifiable given Nigeria status as the 6th largest oil nation in the world and the hardship occasioned by the need to access Premium Motor Spirit, the angst is misplaced as the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) which some are blaming for the current situation is totally blameless as it is equally worried and doing all it could to bring the situation to normal.\n\nThe NNPC under the able leadership of Mele Kyari has no hand in the resultant hardship being suffered by Nigerian in the bid to access the petroleum product as the corporation has been up and doing to ensure that Nigerians have enough fuel to power their vehicles and other devices for the well being of the citizenry\u201d the statement\u201d.\n\nThe group however, exonerated the NNPC from playing any role in the ongoing scarcity after carrying out investigation into the cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cOur investigation have revealed NNPC has not relented in its task of importing products so as to ease transportation and other challenges that have to do with the use of fuel.\n\nWe can authoritatively say that all the jetties are fully stocked as a result of these efforts and currently have no less than 1. 9 billion liters of fuel which ordinarily should serve Nigerians for 32 days non stop even if a single liter is not been imported within the intervening period.\n\nOur findings have also revealed that there is no problem with transportation of products as government has not only paid but has increased the incentives for transporters.\n\nThe problem, we have since established is not with the NNPC but with the marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nThis is most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits\u201d.\n\nFurther more, that in order to maximize the profit for transporters, the government has even increased the freight cost with N10 per liter which brings to about N24 per liter the amount it pays to transporters on every liter\n\nThis is a huge amount that when multiplied results in huge profits for the marketers and ordinarily should have encouraged them to work harder in line with government\u2019s bid to satisfy the citizenry.\n\nThis is more so as the government did that without transferring the responsibility to consumers so as not add to the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nWe therefore frown at the artificial scarcity being created by marketers all in the bid to maximize profit at the expense of millions of Nigerians who are being forced to pay double for fares in order to move from one place to the other and the man hours being wasted just to buy fuel.\n\nVital component of the economy like banks, courts, factories etc are forced to reduce their working hours due to lack of fuel.\n\nWe therefore call on the marketers to show more sense of patriotism by taking into cognisance the pains they put other Nigerians through just to make profit.\n\nWe commend the NNPC GMD for standing firm for Nigeria in this trying period and for shunning all forms of intimidation to take actions that are against the interest of the masses.\n\nLooking at other countries and the global price of PMS across the world today, we can confidently say that Mallam Mele Kyari is a miracle worker to see that Nigeria and Nigerians are still buying PMS for 165 per liter.\n\nIn the USA a gallon of PMS is sold for 5.4 dollars, in Europe it is sold for 4.9 Euro, while back home in Africa, Ghana is selling for 11.87 cedi which is about 587 naira.\n\nThe landing cost of PMS to our country today is 600 per liter and government has not added one naria to what the marketers were buying before so should the marketers think of selling above government price all in the name of transportation cost?\n\nThis is why we are calling on all oil marketers and other stakeholders in the industry to be patriotic and shun sharp practices and put the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians above their high profit-making Target\u201d, Sunday added.",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project.\nThe Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector.\nThe initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\nIn addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized.\nKey programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc. has called on Civil Servants to be dedicated to duty for improved productivity.\n\nAdegbite made the call during the celebration organized by the ministry to commemorate the 2022 African Public Service Day in Abuja.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction working with staff of the ministry due to their commitment to duty which he stressed should be sustained to take the ministry to enviable heights.\n\nDelivering her speech at the ceremony, Permanent Secretary, of the Ministry, Dr Oluwatoyin Akinlade, revealed that efforts were on to ensure that the ministry blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation.\n\nAkinlade who hailed the passion of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, HCSF, Folashade Mejabi Yemi-Esan, for improved productivity and welfare of civil servants, said the theme of the day, \u201cPerformance Management System, PMS: Impact on productivity in the Nigeria Public Sector\u201d was most apt as it summarises the vision of the HCSF to make the service a world class system that drives optimum productivity through effective and efficient performance management.\n\n\u201cShe has vigorously pursued the full implementation of the new Performance Management System through training of various categories of officers. This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

Wade ruling last week. Women in those states seeking an abortion may have to travel to states where it remains legal.\n\nConvening a virtual meeting on abortion rights with Democratic state governors on Friday, Biden said he thinks \u201cpeople are gonna be shocked when the first state \u2026 tries to arrest a woman for crossing a state line to get health services.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think people believe that\u2019s gonna happen. But it\u2019s gonna happen, and it\u2019s gonna telegraph to the whole country that this is a gigantic deal that goes beyond; I mean, it affects all your basic rights\u201d.\n\nBiden said the federal government will act to protect women who need to cross state lines to get an abortion and ensure their access to medication in states where it\u2019s banned.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, told the meeting her state \u201cwill not cooperate\u201d on any attempts to track down women who have had abortions to punish them. \u201cWe will not extradite,\u201d she said.\n\nAbortion rights groups have filed legislation in multiple states seeking to preserve the ability of women to terminate pregnancies.\n\nJudges in Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Utah have since issued decisions preventing those states from enforcing new restrictive abortion laws, while Ohio\u2019s top court on Friday declined to block the Republican-led state from enforcing an abortion ban. read more\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul told the group that \u201cjust a handful of states\u201d are going to have to take care of health of women across the country.\n\n\u201cThere is such stress out there,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cIt is a matter of life and death for American women,\u201d she added.\n\nBiden also told the group there were not enough votes in the Senate to scrap a supermajority rule known as the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade\u2019s protections into law.\n\nHe had proposed that senators remove the filibuster but the suggestion was shot down by aides to key Democratic lawmakers. read more\n\n\u201c(The) filibuster should not stand in the way of us being able to (codify Roe),\u201d Biden said.",

The court\u2019s conservative majority ruled for the first time that the U.S. Constitution grants an individual the right to carry weapons in public for self-defense.\n\nNew York\u2019s Democratic leaders have decried the ruling and the court, saying there will be more gun violence if there are more people carrying guns.\n\nThey conceded they must loosen the state\u2019s century-old permit scheme to comply with the ruling, but sought to keep as many restrictions as they could in the name of public safety. Some will likely be targets for further legal challenges.\n\nThe court ruled that New York\u2019s former license regime, which dates from 1911, gave too much discretion to officials to deny a permit.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who ordered the extraordinary session in the legislature, said the state\u2019s gun-licensing regulations had resulted in New York having the fifth-lowest rate of gun deaths of the 50 U.S. states.\n\n\u201cOur state will continue to keep New Yorkers safe from harm, even despite this setback from the Supreme Court,\u201d she told a news conference in the state capital, Albany, while lawmakers were debating the bill. \u201cThey may think they can change our lives with the stroke of a pen, but we have pens, too.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling allowed that people could be banned from carrying weapons in certain \u201csensitive places\u201d but warned lawmakers against applying the label too broadly.\n\nThe court also made it easier for pro-gun groups to have a regulation overturned. It ruled that a weapons regulation was likely unconstitutional if it was not similar to the sort of regulations around in the 18th century, when the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment was ratified, letting states maintain militias and defining a right to \u201ckeep and bear Arms.\u201d\n\nThe law passed on Friday makes it a felony crime to carry a gun into a new list of sensitive places, including: government buildings, medical facilities, places of worship, libraries, playgrounds, parks, zoos, schools, colleges, summer camps, addiction-support centers, homeless shelters, nursing homes, public transit including the New York City subway, places where alcohol or marijuana is consumed, museums, theaters, stadiums and other venues, polling places and Times Square.\n\nThe law passed on Friday makes it a felony crime to carry a gun into a new list of sensitive places, including: government buildings, medical facilities, places of worship, libraries, playgrounds, parks, zoos, schools, colleges, summer camps, addiction-support centers, homeless shelters, nursing homes, public transit including the New York City subway, places where alcohol or marijuana is consumed, museums, theaters, stadiums and other venues, polling places and Times Square.\n\nLaw enforcement officials and registered security guards are among those exempt from the sensitive-place restrictions.\n\nRepublican lawmakers voted against the law, set to take effect on Sept. 1, complaining that it makes the right to carry weapons lesser than other constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech and of religion.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s going to be easier to get a concealed-carry\u201d license, said Mike Lawler, a Republican member of the Assembly, during the debate. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to be able to carry it anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association, the powerful gun-owners\u2019 rights group whose local affiliate was the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case, called New York\u2019s law a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of the ruling by creating more barriers to New Yorkers\u2019 self-defense rights, indicating it may soon face legal challenges.\n\n\u201cGov. Hochul and her anti-Second Amendment allies in Albany have defied the United States Supreme Court with an intentionally malicious rewriting of New York\u2019s concealed carry law,\u201d Darin Hoens, the New York NRA state director, said in a statement.\n\nThe court ruled in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen that New York licensing officials had too much subjective discretion over who could enjoy what it said was a constitutional right. Applicants were denied a concealed-carry permit if they could not convince an official they had \u201cproper cause,\u201d or some kind of special reason, for carrying a handgun for self-defense. read more\n\nReluctantly and not without protest, Hochul agreed the state must remove the \u201cproper cause\u201d requirements, though the law still requires licensing officers find the applicant is of \u201cgood moral character.\u201d read more\n\nThe new licensing rules require applicants to meet with the licensing officer, usually a judge or a police official, for an in-person interview, and provide the contact details of some immediate family members and any adults they live with.\n\nThe law makes it a felony to carry a gun into private business premises unless the business affirmatively gives notice that concealed weapons are welcome.",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday described the killing of 30 soldiers, seven mobile policemen and two civilians in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State last Wednesday by terrorists as a direct assault on Nigeria, vowing that the attackers would not go unpunished.\n\nThe security agents were ambushed by the terrorists on their way to a mining site in Shiroro, in response to a distress call. Several Chinese and Nigerian nationals were also abducted at the site.\n\nPresident Buhari also said his government would do everything possible to ensure the return of those abducted.\n\nBuhari in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, titled, \u201cPresident Buhari: Attack on Shiroro is an attack on Nigeria herself. It will not go unpunished,\u201d declared that wherever the perpetrators of the dastardly act may be, the long hands of the law would catch up with them.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd to the sadists, I say this: we are coming. No matter what rock you crawl under, what hole you sink into, what lie you hide behind, we are coming and we will find you. Shiroro will see justice. Nigeria will know peace.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari paid tributes to the gallant men of the security forces who lost their lives in the process of defending the attack.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe honour our security forces, and particularly those brave souls who have given their lives fighting against the evil that is terrorism. They constitute the best that Nigeria has to offer and we remember each of them.\n\n\u201cSadly, Nigeria\u2019s fight against terrorism continues. It is a battle that is taking its toll on all of us. But we shall not relent, nor shall we surrender.\n\n\u201cWe say it again that we have reduced Boko Haram to a shell of its former self. But terrorists are parasites. They thrive when the world is suffering.\n\n\u201cThis atrocity only serves to further strengthen us against them. Nigeria is united in obliterating these demons. Each day we grow closer to that goal. When they lash out during times of global suffering it is the act of a cornered animal, an act of desperation.\n\n\u201cAs always, their goal is the same: to sow fear and division amongst us. We will not let them.\n\n\u201cInstead let us pray for the families and loved ones of those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against evil, and let us pray for the safe and speedy return of those abducted. We will do everything possible to ensure their return.\u201d\n\nArmy Confirms Attack\n\nArmy spokesperson, Onyema Nwachuckwu, confirmed the attack in Shiroro in a statement last Thursday.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn Wednesday 29 of June 2022, troops of the Nigerian Army deployed in Shiroro general area responded to a distress call about bandits\u2019 attack on people operating in a mining site. Enroute the location, the troops ran into an ambush tagged by the criminal elements. Sadly, a number of personnel paid the supreme price in the fierce firefight that ensued.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the location has been reinforced and troops are on the trail of the criminals with some already neutralised. The GOC 1 Division has moved to the location to take charge of the follow up operations.\n\n\u201cThe NA notes that some clips of the incident have surfaced online and wish to encourage well-meaning Nigerians to exercise some restraint in posting images of such occurrence, mindful that our brothers and sisters who may have lost their breadwinners deserve to be properly notified and not to get such information via the media. We mention this, mindful of the inalienable rights of citizens to use the social media which is respected.\u201d\n\nArmy Chief Vows to Apprehend Terrorists\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya, yesterday, vowed to bring to justice terrorists behind the attack on his men in Shiroro, Niger State.\n\nThe army chief spoke while addressing newsmen at Mogadishu Cantonment Juma\u2019at Mosque prayer in commemoration of the Nigerian Army Day Celebration, (NADCEL) 2022 and the 159 years of its existence.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are not deterred by any challenge from all those criminals. As we speak, we are on their trail and we will and I say we will get those criminals in Niger and other areas throughout the country.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating 159 years of the existence of the Nigerian Army. It is time to reflect on our performance and look back with pride to appreciate the contributions and sacrifices of the officers and the men of the Nigerian Army over the years as a key instrument of national unity and security of the country.\u201d\n\nNIGER EAST SENATOR LAMENTS\n\nThe Senator representing Niger East, Sani Musa, has lamented the killing of the security agents and residents of the Shiroro Local Government Area of the state last Wednesday.\n\nMusa noted with concern that the incessant killing of his people had turned them to refugees in their own land.\n\nHe further lamented that his people were now languishing in anguish and hunger as the activities of the terrorist had prevented them from going to farms.\n\nHe therefore called on the federal government to urgently intervene in order to save the lives of innocent children and their mothers now displaced and living in camps.\n\nMusa said: \u201cThis latest incident has further put families and loved ones of our security personnel in trauma and untold hardship which they do not deserve.\n\n\u201cIt has also further depleted the nation\u2019s security personnel which unfortunately has not met the required manpower needed to secure the lives and property of people in the state and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cThis coldblooded murder of innocent Nigerians is totally condemnable and should be condemned by all peace-loving members of our society.\n\n\u201cIt is very sad that now that the farming season has commenced many farmers in my constituency have not been able to go to their farms as a result of the activities of bandits and terrorists.\n\n\u201cMany of my people, especially those in Shiroro, Munya and Rafi local government areas are now refugees in Internally Displaced People\u2019s Camps or hibernating with relatives in Minna and other safe environments.\u201d\n\nFG TASKED TO TAKE BATTLE TO TERRORISTS\n\nReactions have continued to trail the gruesome murder of security men and some civilians at the Ajata Aboki mining site in the Erena ward of Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State last Wednesday.\n\nThis is even as the death toll in the massacre has reportedly increased with no fewer than five more corpses recovered from the forest Thursday evening and were deposited at the morgue of the IBB specialist hospital in Minna.\n\nThe corpses were brought in a black Toyota Hilux pick up van which also conveyed some armed soldiers dressed in black and a man dressed in mufti who sat in front of one of the pickup vans.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that though security men moved into Shiroro Local Government Area on Thursday in not less than 10 trucks, they were not able to neutralise the terrorists who were said to have escaped into the Birnin Gwari forest after the incident.\n\nThe terrorists, according to findings, sacked the mining site and could have made away with valuable items including raw gold and cash in addition to the four Chinese and yet unknown number of locals abducted.\n\nThe attack, according to a source, was masterminded by the Dogo Gide terrorists group hibernating in the Birnin- Gwari and Zamfara forests.\n\nOne of the Concerned Shiroro Youths, the body saddled with monitoring the security situation in the local government area, Comrade Yussuf Kokki urged the government to take the battle to the terrorists instead of waiting to counter them after any attack, adding that the strategy of counter attack being adopted would not solve the security challenges facing the state.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nweze and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, Laleye Dipo in Minna",

          "title": "US Senators Demand Relisting of Nigeria on Religious Freedom Concern List for Violence Against Christians",
          "text": "Five United State Senators \u2013 Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio, Mike Braun, James M. Inhofe and Tom Cotton \u2013 have jointly sent a letter to the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken urging him to immediately redesignate Nigeria as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the US International Religious Freedom Act.\n\nThey alleged that recent acts of violence targeting Nigerian Christians have underscored the deteriorating state of religious freedom in the country.\n\nIn their letter, copied to Honourable Rashad Hussain, Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, United States Department of State, the lawmakers stated, \u201cAs you are well aware, horrific acts of deadly violence have been committed against Nigerian Christians in recent weeks, including the massacre of churchgoers on Pentecost Sunday and the stoning of a Christian college student. Sadly, such violence has become all too familiar for Christians in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\n\u201cLast year, however, you inexplicably removed Nigeria\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) despite no demonstrable improvement in the country\u2019s religious freedom conditions. On the contrary, the situation in Nigeria has grown worse. We previously urged you to immediately reverse your misguided decision, and we write today to renew our call.\n\n\u201cRecent high-profile acts of violence underscore the intense religious persecution that is regularly experienced by Nigerian Christians. On Pentecost Sunday, gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria\u2019s Ondo state, reportedly killing at least 50 churchgoers. Last month, a violent mob brutally stoned to death Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu, a student at Shehu Shagari College of Education in northwest Nigeria. According to reports, some Islamist students were enraged by a \u201cblasphemous\u201d message Deborah had posted in a WhatsApp group, in which she said that \u2018Jesus Christ is the greatest. He helped me pass my exams.\u2019 Merely expressing one\u2019s Christian faith has apparently become tantamount to a death sentence in many parts of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThey stated that religious violence and intolerance directed toward Nigerian Christians had worsened in recent years and that one report documented more than 4,650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021.\n\nThe lawmakers continued: Accordingly, Nigeria earns the dubious honour\u2014for the second consecutive year\u2014of being the deadliest country on earth for Christians.\n\n\u201cWe wrote last year that not only has the government of Nigeria failed to take meaningful steps to mitigate such violence, but Nigerian authorities restrict and crack down on religious minorities and detain individuals indefinitely on blasphemy-related charges. We remain concerned that the Nigerian government is failing to protect the religious freedom and basic safety of its Christian citizens.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, as this year\u2019s annual reports from the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and from your own Department make clear, Nigerian government authorities directly participate in the persecution of Christians, Muslims, and even non-theists, most notoriously through arrests and convictions under blasphemy laws. Make no mistake: continued enforcement of state-sanctioned blasphemy laws enables the type of deadly violence that killed Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu and so many others.\n\n\u201cWhen we previously wrote you, we were met with a response which failed to answer our questions about why the State Department views Nigeria as not having engaged in or tolerated \u2018systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom\u2019 or even \u2018severe violations of religious freedom.\u2019 This is unacceptable, especially because you are required by federal law to consider the recommendation of USCIRF\u2014which, since 2009, has been to designate Nigeria as a CPC. In fact, USCIRF reiterated in its 2022 Annual Report that it was \u201cappalled\u201d at the removal of Nigeria\u2019s CPC designation.\n\n\u201cDespite public statements from you and other State Department officials condemning the recent bloodshed in Nigeria, the fact remains that the Department still does not officially regard Nigeria as a severe violator of religious freedom.\n\n\u201cThe State Department released its 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom on June 2, which starts the 90-day timeline for the Department to make its religious freedom designations. Given the abysmal state of religious freedom in Nigeria, it is incumbent upon you to reverse last year\u2019s decision and redesignate the country as a CPC. The moment demands that you do so without delay.\u201d",
