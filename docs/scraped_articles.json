          "text": "Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike says it is hypocritical for the All Progressives Congress to contemplate banning or regulating social media after using it to hoodwink Nigerians to attain power.\n\nHe argued that the APC-led government has miserably failed and wants to use its disagreement with Twitter as a false premise to suppress criticism of the administration\u2019s appalling handling of the affairs of the nation through the dubious regulation of social media.\n\nThe governor, who made this assertion during the inauguration of nine reconstructed streets, including Nzimiro, Herbert Macaulay, Amassoma, Arochukwu, Atako, Ogoja, Akure, Yola and Chinwo in Old Government Residential Area of Port Harcourt on Thursday night.\n\nThe Governor in a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri on Friday morning noted that APC, having become the butt of jokes on social networks, is desperate to trample on the freedom of expression of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYou have misled the country. You told us lies through social media. The same social media that you used to take over government, the same social media you want to regulate and ban. The same social media you used to tell Nigerians lies of how former President Goodluck Jonathan did not do this, how PDP did not do that.\n\n\u201cNow, you want the same social media to be regulated. You don\u2019t want freedom of speech. Now, you want to gag them. Did anybody gag you when you were using them?\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike said the kidnap of scores of students at Federal Government Girls College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State on Thursday, is a further demonstration of APC\u2019s gross ineptitude to guarantee the safety of lives and property of Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians are anxious for the APC to quit power and allow the more experienced PDP to once again restore stability in the polity and dignity of the nation.\n\n\u201cYou wake every morning to hear 20 people have been kidnapped; 30 people have been kidnapped and people are telling us to keep quiet. Is it when they have kidnapped your own daughter?\u201d\n\nWike also took a swipe at the presidency for berating PDP governors who demanded transparency and accountability in the way the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation is managed, and that the APC-led government should be alive to its constitutional responsibility to protect lives and property.\n\n\u201cIn Kebbi, 40 to 50 girls have been kidnapped, our young daughters. And then you are telling me we (PDP) have not proffered solution. Which solution are you talking about? The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is the president that appoints all the security heads in this country.\n\n\u201cNo governor has the power or any role to appoint even a Commissioner of Police. And then you are telling me that we have not proffered any solution. What solution do you want us to proffer? When you have taken your oath of office that you are going to guarantee the lives and property of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike noted that even the President, Major General Muhammad Buhari (retd.), during his recent television interview, disclosed to Nigerians that he has nothing left to offer the country in terms of good governance.\n\n\u201cThe president spoke to us the other day and Nigerians were happy the way he spoke to them, he told them the truth. And the truth is that whether you like it or not, I have nothing again to offer and that was the truth. And people must agree to that.\n\nThe governor said his administration has deliberately embarked on a massive urban renewal drive aimed at restoring the Garden City status of Port Harcourt.\n\nChairman of the Board of Trustees of the PDP, Senator Walid Jubril, who inaugurated the nine streets, commended Governor Wike for transforming Port Harcourt, such that even the blind can attest to it.\n\nJubril said the entire board of trustees of the PDP was proud of Governor Wike\u2019s steadfast commitment to the party, adding that PDP stalwarts across the country, are impressed with the governor\u2019s remarkable achievements and leadership.\n\n\u201cAnybody from this state who is trying to go astray, I am not with him. I am with the people of this state and I will remain with you (Wike),\u201d Jubril stated.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLaments commuters stranded, suffering\n\nBy Chris Ochayi\n\nABUJA: The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio has ordered Reynolds Construction Company Nigeria Limited, RCC, to immediately commence remediation works on the collapsed Aleto Bridge along the East West road in Rivers State axis within 24 hours.\n\nRCC is the construction company handling works on Kilometer 6+500, Section 3A of the East-West road where the collapse Aleto Bridge falls in.\n\nREAD ALSODrop press regulation bill, allow free speech, media bodies tell Reps\n\nAkpabio charged the contractor to should go and ensure a free flow of traffic to ameliorate the suffering of the people stranded on the due road due to collapse of the bridge.\n\nHe said there is need for immediate intervention to make the road passable for already stranded commuters.\n\nBut while the contractors pleaded on sending engineers to the project site by Friday morning to assess the level of damage on the infrastructure, Senator Akpabio insisted that inspection must commence immediately in order to make the road passable for stranded commuters who are going through pains.\n\nSenator Akpabio gave this order yesterday in Abuja after an emergency meeting with the contractors, while blaming the development on delay in mobilization of the contracts for six years.\n\nHe also recalled that compensation before commencement of the project was also delayed, noting that, while, 600million was budgeted for compensation, the ministry later discovered that the actual cost for compensation was N6 billion which it settled last year.\n\nThe Minister who further blamed the crisis on lack of synergy between his ministry and the ministry of power over the construction of power station appealed to the contractors to quickly intervene to ameliorate the suffering of the people.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are putting a lot of pressure on you because you are a reliable partner because if the road is shut down it will affect economic activities.\n\n\u201cRCC that is in charge of the project was not mobilsed for six years, we are planning to have a flyover at that section of the road but lack of synergy between ministry and the ministry of power caused the delay.\n\n\u201cWe discovered we were to pay N6billion as compensation after we have budgeted N600 million for it.\n\n\u201cIt is the commitment of the ministry to ensure the completion of the road and there is also need for a review because prices of materials have gone up.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to RCC contractors to attend to the section of the road before the bridge, President Buhari\u2019s government is a government of solution, they should go and ensure a free flow of traffic to ameliorate the suffering of the people, and we need immediate intervention.\n\nBut while the contractors pleaded on sending engineers to the project site by Friday morning to assess the level of damage on the infrastructure, the minister insisted that inspection must commence immediately in order to make the road passable for stranded commuters who are going through pains.\n\nThe Managing Director of RCC, Engr. Nader Yusuf told the minister that the company has mobilsed engineers to the project site to carry out immediate assessment of the damage as demanded.\n\nHe assured the Minister that road will be made assessable for commuters in the interim while full construction is ongoing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur engineers are already mobilising workers to embark on the project immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Aleto Bridge along the Eleme axis of the East-West road is also the link road to Akwa-Ibom and Cross-River States in addition to over 200 companies operating in Eleme local Government area, especially the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority,Onne, Nigerian Ports Authority,NPA, Federal Ocean Terminal, FOT and Federal Lighter Terminal,Port Harcourt Refinery, Ndoroma Petrochemical Company among others.\n\nMeanwhile, before the unfortunate incident, some stakeholders have raised alarm over imminent collapse of the Aleto Bridge but nothing was done to avert the current crisis",

          "text": "\u2026Overjoyed wife delivered of baby boy hours after husband\u2019s release\n\n\u2026Gov Lalong excited over release of Zongo\n\nBy Marie-ThereseNanlong\n\nTHEIR joy was spontaneous and knew no bound! They danced, sang and praised God in many ways all because of the miracle man of the moment-Reverend Polycarp Zongo.\n\nZongo, a fiery pastor with the Church of Christ in Nations, COCIN, was forcefully taken away on his way to Gombe for a conference on October 19, 2020. In fact, all hope had been lost that he would even return alive, having spent over eight months in the captors\u2019 den without any word from him, leaving his pregnant wife and family members in distress.\n\n\n\nBut on Monday this week, and against all expectations, ISWAP terrorists, who seized the reverend gentleman, voluntarily returned him to his family, leading to an eruption of unceasing joy and celebration in Jos, the Plateau State capital for days.\n\n\n\nMany did not believe that he was the one when he sauntered into his compound. Others received the news of his return as one of the big jokes of the century. But it was true: He had been freed by his captors.\n\n\n\nNot unexpectedly, Christian faithful were overjoyed over the release of Rev. Zongo.\n\nBut looking frail and dazed, but full of thanks and gratitude to God for his divine escape from his evil captors, Zongo, beaming with smiles, described his freedom as \u2018another opportunity\u2019 given to him by God to positively affect the world for Him.\n\n\n\nHe said he could have been killed and his memory wiped off if God had not touched the hearts of his captors to spare his life and to release him after being kept away in the dungeon for eight months.\n\n\n\nTo add to the divine blessing attending his release, his wife, Kaneng, was delivered of a baby boy just hours after he arrived home to tell the story of his captivity. For Rev Zongo, it was a kind of double victory with his release coinciding with the delivery of his son.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe delivery of my wife of a baby boy is a great victory for our family. It is a double blessing and calls for celebration\u201d.\n\n\n\nZongo, who spoke with Arewa Voice on the phone on Tuesday evening in company of one of his allies, John Pofi, expressed joy over his release and appreciated everyone who prayed for him while in captivity and supported his family in any way possible.\n\nReacting to the release, Pastor Pofi disclosed that a non-governmental organisation known as Kalthum Foundation went in for his rescue and brought him out from the dungeon.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe give God the glory,\u201d Pofi, the National Coordinator, Prayer Force Network, said.\n\nPofi, however, urged Zongo to rededicate his life for greater service as he got another chance in life to live and tell his story.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s event is one in a million, to receive one of our own whom like what the Holy Bible says was lost and now is found, and I said, he was dead but God raised him back to life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know that on the second of March, 2021, at the risk of being arrested by agents of the state, I wrote a strong-worded open letter to the President for intervention and subsequent release of Rev Zango and Pastor Balud Yakuru of the EYN who were kidnapped in December, 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe struggle was quite frustrating as people who were supposed to assist were running away from engaging in the struggle to free this gentleman. I must sincerely appreciate the Kalthum Foundation for Peace for its doggedness, courage, resilience and patriotism by standing in the gap to ensure that Rev Zongo is freed from his dangerous captors.\n\n\n\n\u201cKalthum Foundation for Peace and the John Pofi Foundation have done their best and to the glory of God, no ransom was paid for the release of Rev Zongo but his release was made possible through the strong, diplomatic persuading and convincing power of negotiations.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe chided the government saying, \u201cThe federal and state governments have failed in this regard leaving their citizens to their fate. There is urgent need for the federal government to declare a state of emergency in some parts of the country to be able to tackle rising spate of insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking today with great joy not only because the clergyman has regained sanity but because it gives me endless hope that despite the despairing nature of the security situation in the country, there is a little hope at the corner.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor other captives, he stated, \u201cIt therefore means there is hope for Leah Sharibu, there is hope for the 150 kids that were abducted two weeks ago from the Salihu Tanko Islamiya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State some of whom are as young as three years, there is hope for Alice Ngaddah, there is hope for Grace Tuka, there is hope for Lilian Gyang.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is hope for Jummai Saleh, there is hope so many others who are still languishing in captivity. There is hope, and there is hope for you and me whose daily safety is not assured, there is hope for everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nPlateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, also expressed excitement over the release of Rev Zongo and praised all those who played a part in his freedom and those who supported his family while he was in captivity.\n\n\n\nHe urged him to remain strong and use his ordeals to encourage and motivate the people towards trust in God and respect for humanity.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nCivil Society Organisations, CSOs, Friday, urged the Federal Government to take proactive measures to salvage 7 million Nigerians pushed below the poverty line as indicated in a recent report presented by the World Bank.\n\nIt will be recalled that on Tuesday the World Bank in its Nigeria Development Update (NDU) report, titled \u2018Resilience through Reforms\u2019 said high inflation rate caused by rise in prices of goods and services pushed 7 million Nigerians below the poverty line by 2020.\n\nWorld Bank, FG should partner to save situation \u2014 ActionAid\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that we issued a statement on electricity tariff and fuel pump price during the lockdown of COVID-19 pandemic, we argued against it, also the World Bank argued that it was the best time to increase electricity tariff and fuel pump price and they just not stop at that time many Nigerians were going down the drain because of inflation already due to the lockdown and many of them were going out of jobs; a lot of us in the informal sector were locked down, all their capital has been eaten up, and now they are tying to find their way, and then you say this is the best time to increase electricity tariff and fuel pump price, is it for those who are working or not working or those who have lost their jobs?\n\nREAD ALSO: CSOs oppose proposed tariff regulation in bill to amend NBC Act\n\n\u201cWe thought it was never the best time to increase anything, and of course whenever you increase pump price of fuel it causes inflation and the host of other things even food prices go up.\n\n\u201cWhere were we when the pump price increased and electricity tariff? Inflation has jumped up, and it is almost 18 per cent. For the World Bank to look at and say 7 million Nigerians will go below the poverty line, are they kidding me!? They encouraged it, and they want the Nigerian government to deal with it and the Nigerian people are to deal with it. It is such a tragedy we are finding ourselves, and they should ask themselves how we came about by more people going the poverty lane.\n\n\u201cThey should try to track it and trace it back to the increase in fuel pump price and all the discussion of subsidy we don\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cThe government of any country uses their resources to help people in need and I thought that is what government is doing. How can you raise people and then your flog them down with the another hand? We need to really look at it. What is going on here?\n\n\u201cThe government of Buhari said they raised 10 million people out of poverty, and the poverty clock is saying otherwise. But even if you raised 10 million out of poverty and 7 million are fallen because of your decisions, where does that match? We need to reconsider the plight of the poor in this country.\n\n\u201cLike anti-poverty organization like us we re shocked by some of the decisions that are being taken. We need to come back to the drawing board. What have we done to the plight of poor people in Nigeria and the looming population of young people that have no jobs that are milling around the streets and have nothing to think about?\n\n\u201cThe psyche of this people and then you has insurgency we need to deal with it. The political class needs to sit down and put a drawing board and see a kind of society they seem not to see the mirror of what is happening and it is very frustrating at that level because we work at the community levels and directly with the people, and we are really worried about this country.\u201d\n\nFG needs to reduce expenditures, borrow to establish factories for job creation \u2014 CN\n\nThe Convener, Concerned Nigerians, CN, Deji Adeyanju, said, \u201cFor me I am going to take more pragmatic view or approach to this matter because I believe the greatest and fastest ways to get this issue resolved; government needs to cut down expenditures, focus more on the informal sector, work with the private sector to see how to give low interest loans to the private sector to create jobs which is currently we are not doing, and we have no business doing as a nation funding expensive lifestyles of our politicians and civil servants.\n\n\u201cBy now no civil servant should be using official cars including politicians. Those who cannot afford to go to work with their personal cars should be told to resign or stay at home. People can work from home because there are thousands of vehicles that have been purchased and the running cost of these vehicles can develop textile companies, agro-allied factories including juice making companies.\n\n\u201cThe government should show commitment, and Nigeria is becoming broke, and we cannot continue to borrow money to build railways that are not viable.\n\n\u201cYou are not borrowing money to build factories make outstanding contributions to make economic advancement but you are borrowing money to build no-viable projects. We must think out of the box.\u201d\n\nFG must stop propaganda for sound economic programmes to salvage situation \u2014 CISLAC\n\nThe Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, CISLAC, and Head of Transparency International in Nigeria, Auwal Ibrahim Rafsanjani, said, \u201cMany Nigerians believe that the projection by the World Bank does not reflect the reality on the ground as more people are not captured who are facing absolute poverty in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing poverty in Nigeria is an artificial poverty caused by bad governance, corruption and lack of developmental agenda\n\n\u201cIf we are to over come this threat of poverty in Nigeria, government much work towards putting sound programmes no not propaganda\n\n\u201cWe must improve on trade and investment through agriculture, science and technology and human development.\u201d\n\nImprove purchasing power of Nigerians to patronize Nigerian made goods \u2014 AFAN\n\nThe National President, All Farmers Association of Nigeria, AFAN, Arc Kabir Ibrahim, said, \u201cThe report on just 7,000,000 people joining abject poverty due inflation is an understatement.\n\n\u201cWe must improve the purchasing power of our people by patronizing local content in more impactful ways.\n\n\u201cThe generality of our people are unemployed or underemployed and this is the breeding ground for poverty.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Morenike Taire\n\nYou have worked with four multinational companies; was this part of your career plan or it just happened that way?\n\nI was just focused on the particular job at hand but I have been fortunate to come across opportunities to work with these reputable companies and organisations, such as British Council, Procter and Gamble, General Electric and now Coca Cola.\n\nWhat are the positive and negative impacts the multinationals have brought to the local FMCGs?\n\nImpact could be negative and it could be positive depending on the company. Some of the positive impacts are in the areas of technology transfer because when a new technology comes into a country, people are trained on using that technology; so that is expertise being built.\n\nREAD ALSO: Coca Cola Foundation provides computer accessories to 30 schools\n\nAnother would be on employment because there is always an impact on local employment.\n\nThere is usually the initial capital outlay no matter what the company is coming to do. Sometimes it\u2019s capital investment like a factory, sometimes, it isn\u2019t. But those investments are important for a country and have a snowballing impact positively on whatever industry the multinational comes into.\n\nFor example, when a multinational employs someone, they may work with them for their lifetime. Some companies have programmes around leadership development, technical development programmes and those programmes usually yield results for the company in terms of hiring people.\n\nUsually, there will be many more people trained. Another thing is when the multinational comes in, they make profits and pay tax.\n\nFor the negatives, it depends on the company. Different companies operate in different areas. If it is food, they can have different impacts on farmers. One thing that FMCGs could do to stay on the positive are; ensuring that there is local and technology transfer, ensuring that they are developing a local goods supply chain which won\u2019t happen overnight. A company should have a plan in place that sees that the local industries are contributing to whatever products they make.\n\nEven while they may have some expatriates, you want to see increasingly that local talents fill in those leadership positions; that they have strong succession plans. Sometimes, because of certain areas of expertise, you might not have someone locally.\n\nWhat you want to see over a period of time is that multinationals are also exporting talents from the country to other sides because they have developed these talents to the point that they are able to contribute significantly in another country and in another business outside of the country.\n\nSo, it is a give and take.\n\nGeneral Electric and Coca-Cola are very different industries. How do you hope to acclimatise in your new role? Is there a nexus between the two?\n\nBefore GE, I worked for Procter and Gamble which is a consumer product company. The important thing about the kind of roles that I play is in understanding a company, understanding how a company intends to grow and being able to communicate about that company, being able to engage with stakeholders including government and others on behalf of the company.\n\nWe need just to bring strategic thinking into the internal environment. It is being able to work through strong sustainability plans for the company in Coca-Cola\u2019s case. Regardless of whatever type of company an executive finds themselves in, once you have the right technical ability, it has to be more of leadership and about transferring those skills into the new company with a strong understanding of the news industry.\n\nAbsolutely not. Coca cola has an absolutely strong reputation all over the world. It is easier to deliver on reputational work or stakeholders\u2019 engagement work when you are working in a company that already has a strong track record.\n\nI should also point out that coming from GE which is almost two centuries old and 120+ years in Africa, it\u2019s not new for me to work for such a company. The same thing for Procter and Gamble. These are companies that are over a century old and are companies with strong reputations.\n\nMy hope and aim is to build on that reputation and translate that commitment to Africa to show it from the lens of an African. I\u2019m not intimidated at all.\n\nCorporate organisations seem to make it a point to be engaging women on their boards these days. Is there a business case for that?\n\nThere is a lot of research around the fact that companies that have women on their boards are more profitable. There are marketing reports somewhere that have shown that. Having diversity of thoughts in general has been proven to have a correlation with profitability of a company.\n\nBefore, people saw it to be a nice thing to have because you want to show your commitment to diversity but today, it\u2019s actually a commitment to the success and profitability of a company when you have more women on your board.\n\nHow do you hope to influence government policy in such a way to benefit Coca-Cola and the industry generally?\n\nI don\u2019t believe my role is focused on influencing government policy like a lobbyist, but Coca Cola is committed to this continent and to Nigeria as a country and we should look towards a way of working with the government that is mutually beneficial to the country and to the company.\n\nWhat is your job description?\n\nIt is heading a team of professionals that are leading media relations and government affairs, and creating sustainability initiatives and corporate social responsibility. It\u2019s all communications with employees, stakeholders\u2019 engagement and managing this for Coca-Cola across Africa.\n\nOf all the corporate organisations you have worked for, which one has the best Gender Policy as far as you are concerned?\n\nIt is by design because it\u2019s one of the things I look for while joining a company. I have been fortunate to work for companies that have very strong policies that accommodate and promote diversity.\n\nI see the same in Coca-Cola providing an equal platform for both genders to thrive. All these organisations I have mentioned have very strong programmes encouraging women to thrive in leadership positions.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Call for state of emergency on security\n\nBy Adesina Wahab\n\nFormer students of unity schools in the country under the aegis of the Unity Schools Old Students Association, USOSA, have decried Thursday\u2019s attack on the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State during which scores of students and teachers were abducted by bandits.\n\nIn a statement by the National President of USOSA, Mr Lawrence Wilbert made available to our correspondent on Friday, the group also called for an end to such tragic incidents in Nigerian schools.\n\n\u201cThe Unity Schools Old Students Association (USOSA) unequivocally condemns the abduction of scores of students and staff of Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State by bandits in the morning of Thursday 17th June 2021. We also decry the fact that a police officer was killed, while some students and staff sustained gunshot injuries.\n\nEvery student must be accounted for; this tragedy must stop. It is disheartening that the incident occurred at a time when the media is awash with fresh assurances by the Federal Government and the security agencies that everything is being done\n\nto rid the country of bandits and insurgents and safeguard the lives and property of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly piqued by the fact that the bandits were able to carry out their dastardly acts in broad daylight amidst clearly insufficient resistance. USOSA views this latest onslaught on innocent school children as utterly insane and wicked. We deplore the reprehensible attempt to truncate the academic pursuits of Nigerian children and the country\u2019s peace and security.\n\n\u201cThe Association, therefore, insists that the government should immediately secure the safe return of all the abductees, and apprehend the perpetrators and master-minds of the attack. We call for a declaration of a nationwide state of emergency on security, albeit with retention of all democratic structures and offices. While we are mindful that the Federal Government has\n\nover the years taken other steps to tackle the security challenges and even expended colossal sums of money (including billions of naira and dollars) on procurement of arms and ammunition to counter armed criminality in the country, we believe that the progressive deterioration of the security situation nationwide is indicative that more cogent action needs be taken if the unholy marauders must be crushed once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe President and other leaders of the nation must awaken to their responsibility.\n\nThey must act now. In concert with the military and other security agencies, they should rejig strategies aimed at effectively routing the bandits, insurgents and kidnappers and ending the gruesome reign of terror. Security intelligence, surveillance and other proactive measures should be reinforced and broadened to beef up security in the land.\n\n\u201cThe procurement and deployment of drones, prompt installation of functional close-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in all schools, at strategic including churches, mosques, markets and other public places would not be out of place.\n\nPerimeter fences should immediately be erected around all schools. Concrete measures must also be taken to secure our national borders, and all necessary international support sought for\n\nour cause. Furthermore, all the insurgents, bandits and kidnappers who have already been apprehended by the security agencies should be promptly prosecuted and made to face the full wrath of the law so as to serve as deterrence to their cohorts.\n\nSpecial focus should be on identifying and penalising their sponsors too. And our security forces must be sufficiently trained,\n\nequipped, funded and motivated. Nigerians must not be left at the mercy of unconscionable, ignoble outlaws.\n\n\u201cIndeed, our politicians and other elites must rethink their snail-speed, slothful attitude and\n\nlackadaisical response to the security challenges of the nation. They must uphold their oaths of office and act in the interest of Nigeria irrespective of their political, ethnic, religious and socio-economic differences.\n\nThey must earn their upkeep and the trust of Nigerians whose mandate they claim to have received. They must do the needful to put an end to the inglorious carnage and desecration of our land.\n\n\u201cFinally, we urge the security agencies to restore hope by ensuring that there is no recurrence of such brigandage. Their professionalism and efficiency whilst on international assignments are globally acclaimed. We expect that they would acquit themselves even better at home,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe group also charged security and military agents to stop basking in past glories and face the realities of today squarely and rescue Nigeria from insecurity.",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae, Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday set aside the conviction of three lawyers, who were tried for professional misconduct before the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Disciplinary Committee (LPDC).\n\nThe lawyers are Mamman A. Waziri, Olayori Muideen and Dr. Osaretin George Izegbuwa.\n\nA five-man panel of the Supreme Court, led by Justice Mary Odili, was unanimous in allowing the three appeals by the lawyers.\n\nThe lawyers had claimed among others, to have been denied fair hearing on the grounds of distortions in the membership of the panels that heard their cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court, after setting aside the decisions of the LPDC on the lawyers\u2019 cases, ordered that the matters be returned to the LPDC for them to be tried afresh by new panels.\n\nJustice Ejembi Eko authored and read the lead judgments in the three appeals, marked: SC/469/2017; SC/454/2018 and SC/334/2019.\n\nJustice Eko agreed with the appellants that the LDPC was wrong to have been inconsistent in the constitution of its panels that heard the three cases.\n\nThe appellants, whose complaints were similar, argued in the main, that the LPDC was not consistent in choosing members of its panels that heard their cases.\n\nThey noted that some members, who never witnessed the testimonies of some witnesses, participated in the delivery of the panels\u2019 decisions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJustice Eko, who relied on past decisions of the Supreme Court on the issue, particularly that on the appeal by Kunle Kalejaiye (SAN), held that such practice by the LPDC amounts to the denial of the appellants\u2019 right to fair hearing.\n\n\u201cThe issue is whether the appellant had been denied fair hearing. And, I am the considered opinion that, deciding without hearing is an aspect of denial of fair hearing.\n\n\u201cAnd, accordingly, I allow the appeal, set aside the directions of the LPDC, following the decisions in Kunle Kalejaiye, Adeigbe Salami Korisimo and a host of others, and particularly on the principle that where a court is differently constituted during the hearing of a case, on various occasions when it met or where one member did not hear evidence, the effect on the proceedings is to render them all null and void,\u201d Justice Eko said in the judgment on the appeal by Izegbuwa.\n\nJustice Eko suggested the reduction in the number of members of each LPDC\u2019s panel to three or four to prevent the alteration in membership, complained about by the appellants, which he noted, was becoming rampant.\n\n\u201cI noticed that the LPDC panel was rather large and unwieldy for the constancy in attendance and the sitting by all members.\n\n\u201cI should think trimming the LPDC to a panel of between three and four members would achieve a better purpose, considering the recurrence of the same problem,\u201d he said.\n\nJustices Odili, Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, Ibrahim Saulawa and Adamu Jauro, who were members of the panel, agreed with the lead judgments.",

          "text": "From Olanrewaju Lawal, Birnin Kebbi and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nBandits stormed the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, yesterday, abducted yet to be ascertained number of students, five teachers and killed a policeman, in a mid day operation.\n\nMultiple sources said several students and security men who sustained various injuries were receiving care at the Yauri General Hospital.\n\nCommissioner of Police in the state, Adeleke Adeyinka-Bode, confirmed the attack in Birnin Kebbi.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the attack took place and five teachers have been taken away, four male and one female, but the number of students abducted are not known yet.\n\nA parent, Mallam Monsur Yauri, explained that the bandits attacked the school in their hundreds on motorcycles and opened fire on the mobile police guarding the school.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police, Adeleke Adeyinka, assured parents and guardians of students that the Command was following credible leads and intensifying efforts to track the assailants and ensure the rescue of the students and teachers. The command spokesman, SP Nafi\u2019u Abubakar, said in a statement that a team, comprising operatives from the Police Mobile Force, anti-kidnapping and counter-terrorism units have begun combing nearby forests, routes and suspected hideouts of the criminals.\n\nThe police boss assured that the command would do everything within its power to ensure the abducted persons are safely reunited with their families and perpetrators brought to book and appealed to residents to assist with prompt information that would aid in solving the crime and apprehending the criminals.\n\nNotwithstanding the assurance from the police, panic-stricken residents have begun mass exodus from the towns and communities in Yauri. At press time, no fewer than six villages had been deserted.\n\nAn activist from one of the villages, Mallam Muktar Yauri, told Daily Sun on phone that almost all the villagers have relocated for safety.\n\n\u201cAll the residents are running towards Yauri town for their protection. When the bandits attacked, about 200 of them, according to eyewitness, they were selective. They didn\u2019t pick student who were not matured. They overwhelmed the security officers in the school as they shot sporadically. Wallahi, our people are in trauma now in Yauri Emirate.\u201d\n\nState Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Umar Halidu Alhassan told Daily Sun on phone that yesterday\u2019s attack has unsettled residents.\n\n\u201cWallahi, we\u2019re not happy about this incident. It is unfortunate and all the stakeholders must rally round to protect our schools, our state and our people.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that such incident is happening in Zuru and Yauri axis. Government should take proactive measures to protect our schools, our students. Kebbi State has porous borders with neighbouring countries. Our government needs to do something about that because Zuru and Yauri Emirates have porous borders with even other states.\u201d\n\nChairman, House of Representatives Committee on Health Services, Tanko Sununu, who represents Ngaski/Shanga/Yauri Federal Constituency of Kebbi State, decried the insecurity in his constituency and called for the intervention of the Federal Government.\n\nThe lawmaker told journalists in Abuja that children and farmers in his constituency can no longer go to school or farm as a result of insecurity.\n\n\u201cA week ago, we had another calamity when bandits numbering about 300, each with AK-47 and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency.\n\n\u201cThey had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, moving from house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles and cattle. That has led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons into the headquarters of the Emirate in Yauri.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back and in the early hours of today (yesterday), they repeated what they had done earlier and they came into the constituency, sometime around 10.30 or thereabout.\u201d\n\nSununu called on the Federal Government to look at Yauri\u2019s position with its neighbouring Niger State.\n\n\u201cIt has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is the back of River Niger. Our fear is that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Urges military to ramp up fight against insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday assured residents of Borno State of the federal government\u2019s readiness to fight terrorism to the end, telling the military not to give criminals a breathing space to undermine Nigeria\u2019s interests.\n\nThe president, during a visit to Borno State, commended troops for their loyalty and selfless service to Nigeria and urged them not to relent in their efforts to end the insurgency in the North-east.\n\nHe promised support for the families of fallen security personnel, saying he would ensure all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) return to their homes.\n\nHe also commended the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, for his resilience and relentless efforts in rebuilding the state.\n\nBuhari, during the visit to appraise the security situation in the state and to inaugurate some development projects attributed the recent successes recorded by the military against the insurgents and terrorists at Dikwa, Damboa and Gwoza to careful planning, infusion of new equipment and other war materials as well as quality military leadership.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged the enormity of the task ahead of the military.\n\n\u201cThe attacks launched by cowardly terrorists against military and civilian targets last month and in previous months were a pointer to us that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to this region is not yet over,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will not rest until all the millions of Internally Displaced Persons are able to return and resettle in their homes and rebuild their shattered lives.\u201d\n\nHe expressed the hope that the service chiefs would bring to bear on the war, their experience as commanders in theatre at various times.\n\nThe president said: \u201cAll of them are, therefore, personally familiar with the challenge of insurgency. I fully expect them to bring this wealth of personal experience to bear as we move to end this scourge once and for all.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these successes owe a lot to the role played by volunteers of the Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes. These good people include women, who are making huge sacrifices and patriotic contributions to our peace-restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nHe stated that many servicemen and women, as well as volunteers, had been killed in the fight to rid communities and the country of terrorism and insurgency and thanked all those involved for their gallantry and sacrifices.\n\nBuhari assured their loved ones that their sacrifices will not be in vain: \u201cI must also acknowledge the very important role and the sacrifices made by parents, guardians and other loved ones amongst the people of Borno State, the North-east region and the country as a whole, who support their sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in going to battlefields to defend Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and peace. I thank and commend them for their resilience and assure them success is in sight.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a mark of appreciation for the sacrifices made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers that the Nigerian Army was authorised to enlist hundreds of them into the Army.\n\nHe urged the people to sustain the cooperation with the military and the other security services.\n\n\u201cBoth must see each other as being on one side in order for us to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said the late President Idris Deby of Chad played a major role in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region and urged his successors to work hard in restoring democracy to the country and support the processes of bringing peace to the region.\n\nHe said the recent appointment of Ambassador Babagana Kingibe as special envoy to Chad and the Lake Chad Basin was intended to accelerate the restoration of democratic stability in the Chad Republic and enhance cooperation among all the countries of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHe assured the people that the federal government had taken decisive measures to safeguard IDPs and refugees who recently returned from Cameroon and the Niger Republic, adding that it was engaged in the task of rebuilding their communities after more than a decade of war and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was part of these measures that I gave approval for the federal government to build 10,000 resettlement homes in Borno State. Four thousand of these homes have already been completed. Furthermore, I approved for constant release of food intervention by the Nigerian Customs Service and the North East Development Commission in order to support displaced persons.\n\n\u201cI have directed these agencies to sustain and deepen this support. I also wish to specially commend His Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for his tireless efforts in directly supervising the distribution of food and economic empowerment to IDPs in all local government areas.\u201d He expressed the belief that the efforts at alleviating the suffering of displaced communities will hamper attempts by terrorists and insurgents to recruit fighters and spies from IDPs and other vulnerable populations through the use of paltry material incentives.\n\nOn electricity supply, Buhari said his administration would continue to make concerted efforts towards guaranteeing energy security to all, adding that Maiduguri could not, and would not be left out.\n\nHe said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had been directed to expedite the delivery of 50MW power plant in the state towards ensuring the restoration of electricity to Maiduguri and its environs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the light of the current improvement of security in the state, I have also issued directives for the immediate resumption of oil & gas exploration activities in the Lake Chad Basin. This is part of our overall effort to restore the state back to normalcy,\u201d the president explained.\n\nThe president applauded Zulum\u2019s efforts at providing facilities that directly impact the livelihood of people, particularly building educational and health institutions and constructing roads.\n\nHe also commended the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi, as well as all the other royal highnesses and Bulamas at all levels for their very exemplary leadership, patience, determination and wisdom during the past decade of ravage by insurgency and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that royal highnesses now operate from their domains was evidence that peace was being restored to the communities despite the challenges that remain to be overcome.\n\n\u201cThe elders, statesmen, Muslim and Christian community leaders all over this state and region also deserve our thanks and warm appreciation for their resilience, moral leadership and support for the federal and state governments during these trying times.\n\n\u201cI will never forget in my life that during my career as a politician, Borno State is where I got the highest percentage of votes, more than 90 per cent! The least I can do for you is to continue the relentless effort to fully restore peace to this state, the North-east region and the country as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the military and security agencies to continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nBuhari also interacted with some of the wounded soldiers assuring them that the government was committed to their recovery and welfare.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj. Gen. Felix Omoigui, assured troops of the president\u2019s confidence and commitment to their welfare, especially in ending the war.\n\nHe thanked the president for the visit to the troops, which he said would greatly boost the morale of all those fighting to keep the country in peace.\n\nGovernors of Borno and Yobe State, Zulum and Mai Bunu respectively; Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo; Chief of Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao, and National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), were also at the event.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum thanked the president for the relative peace in the state, buoyed by the heavy presence of military and security men who have been engaging the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed the gradual return of peace to Borno State and it is our sincere hope that insurgency will soon be brought to an end,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor appreciated the president for various developmental interventions, which include infrastructure, particularly the approval of 10,000 units of housing for IDPs of which 4,000 had been completed.\n\nPresident Thanks Nigerians for Opportunity to Serve\n\nIn the meantime, the president has expressed his gratitude to Nigerians for the opportunity given to him to serve them.\n\nHe said under his watch, efforts would be made to improve the livelihood of Nigerians, starting with adequate security.\n\nHe said at the palace of the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Garbai El-Kanemi, that he started his administrative career as a military officer in Borno State as a governor for seven months, under Gen. Murtala Muhammed, before he was appointed Minister of Petroleum by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was then a military head of state.\n\nHe added: \u201cMy commitment to serve Nigerians is a payback for the love shown to me. I started my political adventure in Maiduguri and I always look forward to coming here.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, El-Kanemi thanked the president for consistent response to the plight of the people in the state, saying that the security situation has improved.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022IMF laments re-emergence of fuel subsidy\n\n\u2022Welcomes CBN\u2019s measures to unify exchange rates\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos, Francis Ndubuisi and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has warned that rather than being a positive development, the rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria.\n\nHe spoke just as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern over the re-emergence of fuel subsidy in Nigeria in the face of the country\u2019s low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe Washington-based institution, however, welcomed recent moves by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to unify exchange rates, certifying Nigerian banks as being liquid and well-capitalised.\n\nKyari, at the virtual Citizens Energy Congress, tagged: \u201cSecuring a Sustainable Future Energy System through Strategy, Collaboration and Innovation,\u201d yesterday described the rising price of crude oil as a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d situation.\n\nHe added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC, and becoming a burden.\n\nThe forum was organised by DMG Events, a London-based Public Relations company, which said the occasion was to provide an opportunity for players to reset the energy agenda post- COVID-19 and connect the divergent and polarising perspectives.\n\nKyari put the comfort zone globally at $58-$60, saying that for the NNPC, anything above $70-$80 will create major distortions in the projections of the corporation and add more problems to the company.\n\nBrent crude, Nigeria\u2019s oil benchmark, is currently selling for over $74 and is likely to increase further in the coming days as the NNPC continues to battle the dilemma of shouldering the payment of petrol subsidy, which has made it unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nKyari expressed the concern that as the commodity prices rise, buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future, they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60.\n\n\u201cBut for us as a country, as prices go up, the burden of providing cheap fuel also increases and that\u2019s a challenge for us but on a net basis, you know, the high prices, as long as it doesn\u2019t exceed $70 to $80, it\u2019s okay for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria will have no problems supporting the restoration of about 5.8 million barrels a day that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) still has offline since the pandemic, due to the curbs in production quota imposed by the oil cartel.\n\nHe said adding that number to demand will stabilise and probably bring oil prices down to about $60 level or a little below $60, stressing that that\u2019s a comfort zone for every producing company or country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see them (Nigeria) having any difficulty agreeing to add additional volume to cushion the effect of these high prices for this period,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that Nigeria is already producing well below its capacity, because in early 2020, the country actually produced up to 2.4 million barrels of oil per day for both oil and condensates.\n\nWith declining investments in the oil sector, Kyari stated that in a short time, most likely the next five years, the world may experience an energy crisis if the current situation is not properly managed.\n\n\u201cBut we know that a number of things are going on in the transition journey at renewables. Many oil companies are transiting to renewables in the future. And that means that emphasis will be on gas and I see a very turbulent next five years and potentially some stability in the next 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the transition to renewables as a reality, adding that for Nigeria, what is clear is that the country is deficient in infrastructure and, therefore, needs resources from oil to exit poverty.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria, to transit means to go for a low-carbon option and move towards more gas development than the liquids, adding that in the long term, the country needs to find a way out of dependence on oil.\n\n\u201cRenewables are real and we are making efforts to go in that direction, but obviously, our first step is to develop our gas resources.\n\n\u201cIn this industry, you can\u2019t do anything except you have the financing and financing is now clearly constrained both in terms of available resources and the decision of some of the shareholders of some of the lending institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that although everyone seems to be talking about peak oil, there is no reference to gas, which contains lower carbon.\n\nKyari said: \u201cEverybody is saying that in the next 10 years, we will get to peak oil. But nobody has said peak gas. And it\u2019s very difficult to distinguish the two because as you get peak oil, in many cases, you know, oil is produced alongside gas.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s possible, it can be in 10 years time but you also know that what we are doing today in the industry is also curtailing investment and meeting the transition target in 2050.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that in five years\u2019 time, you could be in a situation of shock and this shock will mean that people will have to put more money into producing the liquids and that means that it will defer the date for liquid oil and potentially pushing it by 20 to 30 years.\u201d\n\nRe-emergence of Fuel Subsidy Worrisome, Says IMF\n\nMeanwhile, the IMF has expressed concern over the re-emergence of fuel subsidy in Nigeria in the face of the country\u2019s low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe IMF in a statement at the end of its staff virtual meeting with top Nigerian officials, said the views expressed in the statement were those of the IMF staff and did not represent those of the IMF\u2019s Executive Board.\n\nThe IMF team was led by IMF\u2019s Mission Chief for Nigeria, Ms. Jesmin Rahman, in the virtual meetings with the Nigerian authorities, held from June 1st to June 8th, 2021, to discuss recent economic, financial developments and outlook.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Rahman, in the statement, said the Nigerian economy had started to gradually recover from the negative effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission expressed its concern with the resurgence of fuel subsidies. It reiterated the importance of introducing market-based fuel pricing mechanism and the need to deploy well-targeted social support to cushion any impact on the poor.\n\n\u201cThe mission recommended stepping up efforts to strengthen tax administration to mobilise additional revenues and help address priority spending pressures.\u201d\n\nIt stated that tax revenue collections in Nigeria were gradually recovering but with fuel subsidies resurfacing, additional spending for COVID-19 vaccines, added to address security challenges, the fiscal deficit of the consolidated government was expected to remain elevated at 5.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nIt added that following sharp output contractions in the second and third quarters, GDP growth turned positive in the fourth quarter (Q4 2020) and growth reached 0.5 per cent (year-on-year) in Q1 2021, supported by agriculture and services sectors.\n\nHowever, it said employment level in the country continued to fall dramatically and, together with other socio-economic indicators, remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cInflation slightly decelerated in May but remained elevated at 17.93 per cent, owing to high food price inflation. With the recovery in oil prices and remittance flows, the strong pressures on the balance of payments have somewhat abated, although imports are rebounding faster than exports and foreign investor appetite remains subdued resulting in continued forex shortage.\n\n\u201cThe incipient recovery in economic activity is projected to take root and broaden among sectors, with GDP growth expected to reach 2.5 per cent in 2021,\u201d it added.\n\nIt anticipated that inflation in Nigeria would remain elevated in 2021, but likely to decelerate in the second half of the year to reach about 15.5 per cent, following the removal of border controls and the elimination of base effects from elevated food price levels.\n\nDownside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, and the still uncertain course of the pandemic both globally and in Nigeria, it added.\n\n\u201cThe mission commended the authorities\u2019 measures to contain the transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria, including the ongoing vaccination programme under the COVAX initiative, and strongly supported the authorities\u2019 efforts to acquire additional doses from countries with surplus stocks.\n\n\u201cThe mission urged the authorities to keep reliance on CBN overdrafts for deficit financing within legal limits, while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\n\u201cThe recent removal of the official exchange rate from the CBN website and measures to enhance transparency in the setting of the NAFEX exchange rate are encouraging,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe mission recommended maintaining the momentum toward fully unifying all exchange rate windows and establishing a market-clearing exchange rate.\n\nOn the monetary policy to strengthen the monetary targeting regime, the mission recommended integrating the interbank and debt markets and using the central bank or government bills of short-maturity as the main liquidity management tool, instead of the cash reserve requirements.\n\n\u201cThe banking sector remains liquid and well-capitalised while non-performing loans (NPLs) are contained. The extension of the moratorium on principal payments of qualifying credit facilities on a case-by-case basis through March 2022 should be limited to viable debtors with strong pre-crisis fundamentals.\n\n\u201cCBN stress tests purport that the banking system would remain adequately capitalised except in case of a severe deterioration of credit quality.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it remains to be seen what share of forborne loans may turn non-performing as the impact of the pandemic abates. Since NPLs often rise at the later part of economic crisis, CBN\u2019s strong oversight remains critical to safeguarding financial sector stability,\u201d it said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The immediate past Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Alhaji Mohammed Bukar, who worked under the Minister, Babatunde Fashola, has been asked to explain the mismanagement of over N2.5 billion road contracts in 2017 and 2018 under his watch.\n\nAccording to a government report obtained by SaharaReporters, the PS is alleged to have mismanaged the funds under his watch, at that time when the Ministry was Power, Works and Housing.\n\nAccording to the annual report of the Auditor-General of the Federation on the accounts of the Federation of Nigeria for the year ended, December 31, 2018, obtained by SaharaReporters, Fashola's former PS is alleged to have awarded contracts beyond his threshold.\n\nOne of such was the \"emergency repairs of the Talabu Bridge along the Tegina-Mokwa Road in Niger State, which cost N2.5 billion.\"\n\nThe report indicting Fashola's former PS partly reads, \"Issue one; Contract for the purchase of project monitoring vehicles without due process - N343,833,338.00. Section 24(1) of the Public Procurement Act, 2007 states that \u201cexcept as provided by this Act, all procurements of goods and works by all procuring entities shall be conducted by open competitive bidding.\n\n\"Audit observed that the sum of N343,833,338 was paid for the purchase of 36 project monitoring vehicles without following due process. Further examination revealed that the 36 vehicles were not received into store as there was no documents to show such delivery.\n\n\"The Permanent Secretary is required to account for the sum of N343,833,338.00.

          "title": "AFTERMATH: With new polling units, cost of contesting elections just ballooned",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been consistent with plans to improve voter access in elections. On Wednesday, the commission under Mahmood Yakubu took a major step towards that goal by raising the number of Nigeria\u2019s polling units (PUs) to 176,846.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, 56,872 voting points and voting point settlements were converted into full-pledged PUs, effectively bringing the ballot closer to voters.\n\nThe voting points were created a few years ago as alternatives to PUs after several unsuccessful attempts to create additional PUs, with the number of registered voters in a unit used to determine how many voting points needed.\n\nBut because the measure was not sustainable, INEC sought to convert the voting points to PUs, thereby expanding key electoral activities \u2014 including deployment of political party agents \u2014 to the new units.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE AGENTS MEANS MORE MONEY\n\nAccording to INEC guidelines, political parties are to have one polling agent as their representative in every polling unit, which means that each of the 18 parties needs additional 56,872 agents to complete their list to 176,846.\n\n\u201cThat will be very tough and draining for the political parties,\u201d according to Leonard Nzenwa, chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), the umbrella body of political parties in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNzenwa told TheCable that while the move is a right step, \u201cit is going to be a herculean task for political parties to deploy agents in all the polling units \u2014 and no party can do that alone except those that enjoy government patronage or have been in government\u201d.\n\nIn past elections, only the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have had their eyes and ears at all polling units in almost all elections, with other parties failing to deploy their agents often as a result of inadequate resources.\n\nAnd in locations where agents of the parties are missing, adequate oversight for its candidates is also not ensured.\n\nBut the additional expenses also affects INEC \u2014 which now need to have four ad hoc officials in all PUs \u2014 as well as observer groups such as the Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth and Advancement (YIAGA) \u2014 which will need more observers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the benefits far outweigh the financial demands, according to Cynthia Mbamalu, programme manager at YIAGA.\n\nINCREASED TRANSPARENCY COMES WITH MORE POLLING UNITS\n\nMbamalu told TheCable that its most important benefit is bringing the ballot closer to the people, thereby promoting voter access.\n\n\u201cIt also reduces the tendency of electoral manipulation and fraud because while votes were being counted in voting points before, the results needed to be transmitted to the polling units to be collated and a lot of manipulation happened before the results got to there,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a blindspot that no one took interest in observing. So now, everyone knows that collation happens at the ward and there is no additional process where you do not provide oversight.\u201d\n\nThe YIAGA official said the additional PUs create an opportunity for better computation of results as \u201cwe used to see ad hoc officials get tired and make mistakes when they are adding voting point results at the polling units\u201d.\n\nNIGERIA NOT ALONE IN RISING COST OF ELECTIONS\n\nThe issue of the rising cost of elections remains a major issue in large democracies and Nigeria \u2014 where N234 billion was approved for the conduct of the 2019 elections \u2014 is no exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia, the world\u2019s biggest democracy, was reported to have spent $8 billion in its last general election in 2019, almost twice what was spent in 2014 and about 14 times more than what Nigeria spent in its last general election.\n\nThe statistics are not anywhere comparable to that of Nigeria though: India has over 900 million eligible voters (Nigeria has just 84 million) and close to one million polling stations.\n\nIn the United States, the elections held last year was estimated to have cost $14 billion dollars, more than double the expenses in 2016. But unlike in Nigeria, candidates in US elections often rely on fundraising, including President Joe Biden who was the first person in US to raise over $1 billion in election funds.\n\nIn Canada, the last general elections were estimated to have cost $504 million spanning four years. However, it is a different ball game in the country as political parties and candidates are reimbursed up to 60 percent of their election expenses as well as other personal expenses \u2014 provided they meet certain terms.\n\nWAY FORWARD? TECHNOLOGY; PARTIES ALSO WANT GRANTS\n\nMbamalu told TheCable that because it will be challenging for all parties and their candidates, particularly women and youths, to deploy agents in all the polling units, there is a need to take advantage of existing structures.\n\n\u201cIf technology provisions for collation and transmission will be adopted, one of the best things that can be done is to leverage election result portals,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRather than have agents everywhere, you draw a sample of polling units to deploy them and you then have others who track the INEC portal for results. So, as the results are being uploaded on the portal, they are downloading them and cross-checking with others.\u201d\n\nFor IPAC, political parties need subvention from the government more than ever before. Nzenwa, who is also the national chairman of the Africa Alliance Congress (AAC), told TheCable that the parties need financial assistance that could come in the form of grants.\n\n\u201cWe are asking the government to give the parties subvention through INEC.

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been consistent with plans to improve voter access in elections. On Wednesday, the commission under Mahmood Yakubu took a major step towards that goal by raising the number of Nigeria\u2019s polling units (PUs) to 176,846.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, 56,872 voting points and voting point settlements were converted into full-pledged PUs, effectively bringing the ballot closer to voters.\n\nThe voting points were created a few years ago as alternatives to PUs after several unsuccessful attempts to create additional PUs, with the number of registered voters in a unit used to determine how many voting points needed.\n\nBut because the measure was not sustainable, INEC sought to convert the voting points to PUs, thereby expanding key electoral activities \u2014 including deployment of political party agents \u2014 to the new units.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE AGENTS MEANS MORE MONEY\n\nAccording to INEC guidelines, political parties are to have one polling agent as their representative in every polling unit, which means that each of the 18 parties needs additional 56,872 agents to complete their list to 176,846.\n\n\u201cThat will be very tough and draining for the political parties,\u201d according to Leonard Nzenwa, chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), the umbrella body of political parties in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNzenwa told TheCable that while the move is a right step, \u201cit is going to be a herculean task for political parties to deploy agents in all the polling units \u2014 and no party can do that alone except those that enjoy government patronage or have been in government\u201d.\n\nIn past elections, only the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have had their eyes and ears at all polling units in almost all elections, with other parties failing to deploy their agents often as a result of inadequate resources.\n\nAnd in locations where agents of the parties are missing, adequate oversight for its candidates is also not ensured.\n\nBut the additional expenses also affects INEC \u2014 which now need to have four ad hoc officials in all PUs \u2014 as well as observer groups such as the Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth and Advancement (YIAGA) \u2014 which will need more observers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the benefits far outweigh the financial demands, according to Cynthia Mbamalu, programme manager at YIAGA.\n\nINCREASED TRANSPARENCY COMES WITH MORE POLLING UNITS\n\nMbamalu told TheCable that its most important benefit is bringing the ballot closer to the people, thereby promoting voter access.\n\n\u201cIt also reduces the tendency of electoral manipulation and fraud because while votes were being counted in voting points before, the results needed to be transmitted to the polling units to be collated and a lot of manipulation happened before the results got to there,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a blindspot that no one took interest in observing. So now, everyone knows that collation happens at the ward and there is no additional process where you do not provide oversight.\u201d\n\nThe YIAGA official said the additional PUs create an opportunity for better computation of results as \u201cwe used to see ad hoc officials get tired and make mistakes when they are adding voting point results at the polling units\u201d.\n\nNIGERIA NOT ALONE IN RISING COST OF ELECTIONS\n\nThe issue of the rising cost of elections remains a major issue in large democracies and Nigeria \u2014 where N234 billion was approved for the conduct of the 2019 elections \u2014 is no exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia, the world\u2019s biggest democracy, was reported to have spent $8 billion in its last general election in 2019, almost twice what was spent in 2014 and about 14 times more than what Nigeria spent in its last general election.\n\nThe statistics are not anywhere comparable to that of Nigeria though: India has over 900 million eligible voters (Nigeria has just 84 million) and close to one million polling stations.\n\nIn the United States, the elections held last year was estimated to have cost $14 billion dollars, more than double the expenses in 2016. But unlike in Nigeria, candidates in US elections often rely on fundraising, including President Joe Biden who was the first person in US to raise over $1 billion in election funds.\n\nIn Canada, the last general elections were estimated to have cost $504 million spanning four years. However, it is a different ball game in the country as political parties and candidates are reimbursed up to 60 percent of their election expenses as well as other personal expenses \u2014 provided they meet certain terms.\n\nWAY FORWARD? TECHNOLOGY; PARTIES ALSO WANT GRANTS\n\nMbamalu told TheCable that because it will be challenging for all parties and their candidates, particularly women and youths, to deploy agents in all the polling units, there is a need to take advantage of existing structures.\n\n\u201cIf technology provisions for collation and transmission will be adopted, one of the best things that can be done is to leverage election result portals,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRather than have agents everywhere, you draw a sample of polling units to deploy them and you then have others who track the INEC portal for results. So, as the results are being uploaded on the portal, they are downloading them and cross-checking with others.\u201d\n\nFor IPAC, political parties need subvention from the government more than ever before. Nzenwa, who is also the national chairman of the Africa Alliance Congress (AAC), told TheCable that the parties need financial assistance that could come in the form of grants.\n\n\u201cWe are asking the government to give the parties subvention through INEC. We asked for subvention at the national assembly during the constitutional review, because that used to happen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe grants, which will be audited, help the parties strengthen democracy in the country. As it stands, it is an unequal playing field. Some parties are enjoying a higher level of advantage over the young ones, and it is not good for fairness.\u201d",

          "title": "TeamApt anticipates unicorn bells on the back of $16bn agent banking blitz",
          "text": "TeamApt has become a leader in Nigeria\u2019s agent banking business and that could drive it to the envied status of a billion-dollar startup in the coming months.\n\nHeadquartered in Lagos Nigeria, the company started off in 2015 building applications for banks. By the end of 2018, it processed an average of $160 million transactions per month by supporting the operations of 26 banks.\n\nA year later, it launched Moniepoint, a platform for agent banking.\n\nAs one of the \u201cSuper Agents\u201d licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, TeamApt\u2019s Moniepoint powers thousands of shops where typical banking transactions \u2013 deposits, withdrawals, account opening and more \u2013 are now performed in Nigeria using point-of-sale devices.\n\nBut facing competition from other players, how well is Moniepoint performing?\n\nLeading the pack\n\nTosin Eniolorunda, TeamApt\u2019s founder and CEO, is confident that it is the industry\u2019s number one.\n\nHis audacity is based on data from SANEF, the body empowered by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria. According to this data, TeamApt accounts for 74% of the agent banking industry based on the volume of transactions processed monthly.\n\nSANEF\u2019s agent banking data is not public. It is sent confidentially to startups in the sector. TechCabal has not independently verified ranks of performance among these companies.\n\nEniolorunda points to the company\u2019s transaction value numbers as another measure of TeamApt\u2019s maturity in the fintech sector \u2013 and future valuation.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time, according to the CEO. The value for May was \u20a61.4 trillion ($3.5 bn) from a base of 68 million transactions. Total value of transactions TeamApt has processed between April 2020 and April 2021 is $16 bn.\n\nTeamApt says it processed $3.5bn in May 2021, thanks to its leading share of Nigeria\u2019s agent banking sector\n\nThese transactions are from four use cases: deposit, withdrawal, as well as airtime and bill payments. Moniepoint, the company says, has 14 million unique customers monthly.\n\nUnicorn calling?\n\nEniolorunda does not specify what the company\u2019s present valuation is. But based on the above numbers and those of other Nigerian fintechs, he believes TeamApt seats comfortably among the continent\u2019s most valued startups.\n\n\u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal earlier in May.\n\nIn March, Flutterwave said it had processed over 140m transactions worth over $9bn since its founding.\n\nAvailable numbers for Opay are from 2020; the Opera-backed company claimed to have processed $1.4 bn in October and $2bn in December of that year. Paga, on the other hand, processed $2.3 billion in 2020 and $8 billion over the last four years according to CEO Tayo Oviosu.\n\nBig Milestone for Paga @mypaga & Digital Acceleration\n\n\n\nWe crossed 3 Trillion Naira in transaction values processed since the start of commercial operations in 2012.\n\n\n\nHit N2 Trillion in March 2020\n\n\n\nHit N3 Trillion in May 2021\n\n\n\n15 months to process 1 Trillion!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 #JustPagait \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) June 7, 2021\n\nNot much is known about Firstmonie, also in the agent banking heavyweight category. Observers say it is more private due to its ownership by First Bank.\n\nUnless TeamApt is acquired for a billion dollars or goes public, the only available way to estimate its valuation will come after a funding round.\n\nRumors of an announcement circulated briefly in May but the company has yet to officially declare a round. Its last fundraise was $5.5m Series A in February 2019, led by Jim Ovia\u2019s Quantum Capital.\n\nAt a media event this week Thursday, Eniolorunda confirmed the round \u2013 \u201ca couple of tens of million\u201d \u2013 has been closed. Another \u2013 \u201ca lot more\u201d \u2013 is in progress.\n\nWhen these are announced, a clearer picture will emerge of the company\u2019s valuation, direction and, more broadly, investor appetite for high-growing fintech companies in Africa.\n\nFlutterwave and Chipper Cash have made headlines in the first half of the year with $100-million-plus rounds that catapulted them to unicorn status. OPay is reported to have a $400 million deal in the works which could value it at $1.5bn, and Paga expects to be a unicorn in a year or two.\n\nIs TeamApt next in line?\n\nDigital bank on the horizon\n\nMeanwhile, the company is evolving to a more consumer-facing company.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we are directing our business towards becoming a digital bank,\u201d Enioolorunda says.\n\nIn this new direction, Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking but will also be used as an app by individuals as a digital bank. Eniolorunda says this \u201chybrid approach\u201d is essential to truly serve underserved people in Africa who, for good reason, retain a need to physically visit service providers when quality falls short.\n\nThe other expansion on the company\u2019s playbook is geographical; TeamApt plans to start operating in the \u201cthird-largest francophone country\u201d in Africa by the third quarter of the year, the CEO says.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, on Wednesday, denounced several media reports as \u201cmisleading\u201d after they suggested that the company\u2019s services in the country will be disrupted.\n\nThe said reports came on the back of a notice sent by MTN, informing customers of possible service disruptions due to increased insecurity in different parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSadly, we must inform you that with the rising insecurity in different parts of Nigeria, service delivery to your organisation may be impacted in the coming days,\u201d MTN wrote in a message to customers. \u201cThis means that in some cases, our technical support team may not be able to get to your site and achieve optimum turnaround time in fault management as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nHowever, the notice was targeted at select MTN Nigeria\u2019s enterprise customers in a few locations to help them put business continuity measures in place, the local unit of the South African telecoms giant, MTN Group, said in another statement sent to TechCabal.\n\nAccording to the company, the notice in question was a \u201croutine notification to a small group of businesses affected by a specific challenge in very few specific locations.\u201d These notices are \u201cregularly distributed to partners and are not out of the ordinary,\u201d MTN Nigeria CEO, Karl Toriola, said in the statement.\n\nMTN is \u201cdedicated to delivering the highest levels of service possible, and steadfast in our drive to ensure our customers have the information they need to make critical personal and business decisions and will continue to update them on relevant developments,\u201d Toriola added.\n\nThe scale of service disruption is unknown but it is unlikely to affect MTN\u2019s dominance in the local market. According to data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), MTN Nigeria accounts for 43% of the country\u2019s internet subscribers and 38% of mobile subscribers.\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, MTN Nigeria saw a 21% year-on-year surge in active data subscribers to 32.5 million and a 27% year-on-year increase in smartphone penetration to 36.3 million. The increase in its number of subscriptions propelled strong growth in data revenue, which rose by 43% year-on-year to N106 billion ($257 million) and accounted for 28% of the company\u2019s total revenue.\n\nApart from the potential service disruption tied to MTN, a nationwide strike of union workers against service providers in the telecommunications industry also threatens to interrupt data and cellular services in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nAs reported by TechCabal earlier this week, the Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN), which comprises senior telecoms staff in the country, said that it would be embarking on a three-day warning strike starting Wednesday to protest the \u201carbitrary sack of workers and casualisation.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

This high figure is because of inadequate information about the disorder and late diagnosis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContrary to the popular narrative, autistic children can live better and happier lives if provided with the right tools and information to fit their individual learning needs.\n\nLater today, our reporter, Joy Matthew, will write extensively on how technology can facilitate early diagnosis of autism, create awareness, and reduce stigmatisation.\n\nYou definitely don\u2019t want to miss this, as she will also share insights from a seasoned special children expert on the issue.\n\nKune, Kenyan foodtech startup, raises $1m pre-seed\n\nL-R: Founder and CEO, Kune Africa, Robin Reecht and his team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nKune, a Kenyan foodtech startup, has raised a $1 million pre-seed round to launch its on-demand food service in August.\n\nThe round was led by pan-African early-stage VC, Launch Africa Ventures. Consonance Investments, Liechtenstein-based investment company, Century Oak Capital GmbH, and Pariti, an ecosystem management firm, also invested in this round.\n\nFounded in December 2020 by France-born Robin Reecht, Kune\u2019s objective is to provide ready-to-eat food services at an affordable price.\n\nThis funding will be used to internalise all production and human resources capacities, hire more team members and finish building the startup\u2019s factory.\n\nInterestingly, six-month-old Kune is one of the first non-fintech startups in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem to raise a seven-figure pre-seed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer TechCrunch, after two months of operation, the startup took a few months off to restructure, hire more people, and build a factory to produce 5,000 meals daily.\n\nKune adopts a hybrid model that combines virtual kitchens and delivery-only restaurants.\n\nThe startup plans to launch in August 2021, after building its factory, and own a fleet of 100 electric motorcycles by early 2022.\n\nFor context, read more here.\n\nAnother African Disney Original in the making\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nSouth African animation studio, Triggerfish, in collaboration with Walt Disney, will be producing an African-themed sci-fi series titled Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire.\n\nInterestingly, this animated anthology will be in ten parts, with each one \u2014 a ten-minute story \u2014 written by African creators from Zimbabwe, Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Egypt.\n\nAmerican illustrator and movie director, Peter Ramsey \u2014 director of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse \u2014 is one of the popular directors and animators working on the project.\n\nDoes this sound familiar? On Friday, December 11, 2020, Walt Disney hinted at a collaboration with a pan-African entertainment entity, Kugali Media, founded by creatives from Nigeria and Uganda.\n\nWhat should you expect? The films in the anthology will cover the complete scope of science fiction. Therefore, you should expect things like time travel and aliens seen through an African lens.\n\nWhile you are here, read this for context.\n\nFacebook\u2019s podcast service\n\nFacebook plans to launch its podcast product on Tuesday, June 22, 2021. It will allow people to listen to every episode of podcasts they subscribe to directly on Facebook.\n\nAnother one from Facebook? Just last month, Facebook announced its Audio Live Room features. Read this to know more.\n\nYou can use the podcast service after logging in to your Facebook account and linking up your show\u2019s RSS feed to Facebook. For context, the RSS is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardised and computer-readable format.\n\nLinking is necessary because it automatically generates News Feed posts for published episodes, so your followers will be notified of new podcasts automatically.\n\nWhat\u2019s fun? Podcasters can enable 60-second clips \u2014 to be created by listeners \u2014 that might increase visibility and engagement.\n\nOne more thing you should know about this feature: The Facebook Podcast Terms of Service do not clearly state what Facebook can do with the podcasts shared on its platform.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? It means putting your podcasts on the platform may give Facebook the right to imitate your works. This isn\u2019t a good sign if you are protective of your intellectual property.\n\nWhat is not clear is how Facebook will determine what pages belong to podcasters.\n\nSidebar: It might interest you to know that Spotify \u2014 a Swedish audio streaming and media service provider \u2014 recently launched Greenroom. This app helps users convert their live audio chats to podcasts.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nGebaya announces the launch of its free marketplace, plans to grow its talent pool to 15,000 in 3 years.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has hinted at a new requirement for financial technology businesses in the country. Starting Q3 2021, fintech platforms with no defined framework will have to go through an incubation program to legitimately operate.\n\nCalled the Regulatory Incubator (RI) program, the Commission explained in a statement released on June 16, 2021, that it introduced the program to allow fintechs with new business models and processes to properly fit into existing regulations.\n\nThis will include both startups already operating and those still looking to enter into the fintech sector. The regulator adds that it is constantly looking for ways to accommodate innovation without \u2018compromising market integrity and stay within limits that ensure investor protection.\u2019\n\nOnce the program kicks off in Q3 2021, financial businesses running on full or auxiliary technology in the country will have to fill a Fintech Initial Assessment (FIA) form to determine if they are excluded from the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the situation where the said innovation doesn\u2019t have an existing regulatory framework, the startup will proceed to apply for the RI program.\n\nBased on SEC\u2019s terms, the application will either be accepted or rejected on the basis of whether the innovation is allowed or not.\n\nTen months into the incubation program, the startup will be presented with guidelines covering its services. This is to help it gain clarity on the appropriate regulatory regime applicable to it.\n\nOn completion of the 12-month program, the startup is either directed to continue operating as a registered entity or terminate its operations.\n\nIt can only be imagined how far reaching the effect of this intended move will have on fintech startups as a number of innovations in the country\u2019s fintech sector are still trying to find a fit within the existing regulations governing the financial sector.\n\nA possible implication is that API fintech startups, micro-lending platforms, investment tech, and other innovations operating under no specific regulatory framework may have to cease operation until certified through the incubation program.\n\nAlready, there are existing CBN guidelines covering mobile money operators, e-payment channels, USSD services, international money transfer, remittance and similar services. As it were, crowdfunding startups barely escaped this new directive as a framework was recently enforced in May.\n\nCrypto and digital commodity investment startups, on the other hand, may not make it through the FIA stage since their services are still restricted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this can be explained as another case of regulations chasing after innovation. Still, it is unclear when regulations begin to stifle innovation, even as fintechs have been helping boost financial inclusion on the continent.\n\nIt is also not clear how this incubation program is different from the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s regulatory sandbox \u2014 a platform that allows fintech companies to test their products and get regulatory approval before launching.\n\nA major drawback to the CBN\u2019s sandbox could be a distrust for regulators among most startup founders.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s incubation program, however, has the added incentive of legitimacy, but the Commission has not revealed how it plans to enforce it.",

          "text": "The Nigerian media industry has called on the House of Representatives to step down a bill seeking to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, saying it is still a subject of litigation at the Supreme Court.\n\nThis message was given by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO), which covers the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), and the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), at the House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values organised public hearing on the bill. The House, however, insisted on going ahead with the exercise.\n\nIn recent time, several media organisations and groups have criticised various clauses in the bill as possibly discouraging Freedom of Speech in the country.\n\nThe committee had organised the hearing on five bills that include the \u2018Bill for an Act to Amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, to Remove Bottlenecks Affecting Its Performance and Make the Council in Tune with Current Realities in Regulating the Press and for Related Matters (HB 330).\u2019\n\nOlusegun Odebunmi, chairman of the committee, apologised to the Nigerian media, especially NPAN that protested on Wednesday over exclusion from the exercise, saying an open invitation to the event was extended to all stakeholders.\n\nOdebunmi said, \u201cSo, I am sorry if there is anybody who thinks we did not invite them. It is not by intention; it was definitely a mistake. Notwithstanding, we have covered everybody through our advert.\u201d\n\nHowever, Azubuike Ishiekwene, editor-in-chief of Leadership Newspapers, who represented the NPO, said contrary to the claim of an open invitation by the committee, the organisation did not receive any notification that would have enabled it engage the lawmakers and Nigerians robustly on the bill.\n\nRead Also: War against everybody\n\n\u201cThere is a matter and I am sure that as stewards of the people and the law, you are aware that there is a pending matter between the NPO and some parties involved in this legislation. That is why a negotiated conversation seems to us to be a way to deal with it because there is a matter pending before the Supreme Court: between the NPAN and some parties involved in this bill that is being amended. And as stewards of the law, I am sure you are constrained just as I am to make any further conversations on this matter because it is a pending matter before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe last time it came up in 2010 \u2013 it is a matter that has actually been pending since 1999 \u2013 17 of the 39 clauses contained in the bill that you are considering were ruled unconstitutional by the court at that time. Of course, the Federal Government appealed the ruling. We won the appeal and the matter is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI will rest my case by appealing to the honourable members of this committee; I crave your indulgence to refer to a conversation that was had on a similar matter in 2018 when this matter came up before the Senate and the pendency of this matter before the court was canvassed. And the Senate \u2013 the 8th National Assembly \u2013 at that time agreed that the prudent thing to do was to step it down. I urge this House to also consider a similar step,\u201d Ishiekwene stated.\n\nRead Also: In defence of dissent\n\nOn his part, Odebunmi argued that the House was doing its constitutional job \u201cand I am very sure (that) no court will restrain us from doing the job,\u201d saying while the lawmakers would not stop anybody from going ahead with the judicial process, the lawmakers had the mandate of Nigerians to amend laws.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is not about the matter in court, it is an Act of the National Assembly and we deemed it fit to amend it and we are doing that. It does not stop you from what you are doing but this is the position of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nIn a memo was signed by Lanre Arogundade, executive director, IPC; Edetaen Ojo, executive director, MRA; Richard Akinola, executive director, CMLA, and Dapo Olorunyomi, executive director, PTCIJ, the International Press Centre, Media Rights Agenda, Centre for Media Law and Advocacy and the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, a joint memorandum titled \u2018For a Truly Independent and Media Freedom Friendly Nigeria Press Council,\u2019 called on the National Assembly to expunge all laws intended to criminalise free speech and press.\n\nArogundade, who read from the memo, said, \u201cFirst, we like to say that the international behaviour towards media regulation is peer regulation, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press, and the expunging from statute all laws that criminalises freedom of expression. This is the line the Committee should tow as Ghana has done and like South Africa has done; and with regards to throwing off defamation statute from the books, the way Sierra Leone has done.\n\n\u201cA consideration is that the amendment seeks an unabashed focus to restrict freedom of expression while masking the toga of something else. It attempts to do what other laws have done like the Cybercrimes Acts which Sections 24 and 38, which in no fewer than ten instances have been used to clamp down on bloggers or journalists for expressing opinion antagonistic to politically or economically powerful elites.\n\nRead Also: Armstrong\u2019s strong arm tactics threaten Nigeria\u2019s $1bn broadcasting industry\n\n\u201cBodies like the Amnesty International has documented 50 cases where the law had targeted, not cybercrime suspects, but bloggers and journalists for writing on what they \u2018know to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another.\u2019\u201d\n\nOthers are that \u201cThe ethical code that should be operationalised by the council is the Code of Ethics of Journalists in Nigeria as adopted by the Nigerian Press Organisation, comprising the Nigeria Union of Journalists, the Nigerian Guild of Editors and the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria in Ilorin in 1998 and as may be regularly updated. This has been the practice. A political and non-journalism office like that of the Minister of Information should not be given the power of approval over the code of conduct of journalists.\n\n\u201cThe power to determine sanctions relating to hefty fines should be vested in the courts and not the council. The Court of Appeal has clearly established this legal principle in NOSDRA v Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (2018) LPELR-44210 (CA) where it held that \u2018the imposition of fines by NOSDRA was contrary to its powers on the basis that penalties or fines are imposed as punishment for an offence or violation of the law and the power as well as competence to establish that an offence has been committed belongs to the courts and not a regulatory agency.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe provision relating to revocation of license for alleged publication of fake news should be removed from the Act. Decisions for appropriate sanctions in relation to such offences should be vested in the law courts.\u201d",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, reassured that his government will sustain ongoing infrastructure projects across the state to boost economic activities and improve the lives of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are aware and know that the road has been awarded by NDDC. We make sure that we don\u2019t duplicate efforts. NDDC has not been forthcoming with contracts that have been awarded at that level.\n\n\u201cIn a normal system, if the NDDC has lived up to their responsibility and done the right thing, the government will not need to do the same project.

It is not an excuse to allow the people suffer, following the failure of an agency to perform their statutory responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cAs soon as possible, we would send government agencies to check the immediate state of the road and report back. We will do something quick for our people at Urhonigbe because we know that our people are predominantly farmers.\n\n\u201cWe would deploy officials from the Ministry of Infrastructure to examine the state of the road to enable us to provide palliative measures before providing a permanent solution to the road. As an administration, we will do our best to ensure that the people of the community feel the impact of the government.\u201d\n\nAppreciating the people of Ugha Quarters for the support before, during and after the governorship election in the state, the governor noted: \u201cI appreciate you for your support and prayers before, during and after the election, as well as your support throughout the time in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe last election proved to us that you trust this administration and I want to assure you that the confidence reposed in us will not be betrayed.

          "title": "ANALYSIS: In two years, Lawan\u2019s Senate records more failures than successes",
          "text": "As part of its activities to celebrate its second anniversary, the ninth assembly of the Senate held a special plenary session on July 9.\n\nThe session, which lasted for hours, was dominated by songs of praises with lawmakers taking turns to pat themselves on the back for a \u2018job well done.\u2019\n\nAlthough a few picked holes in the workings of the Senate and suggested ways to do better, the majority of the senators who spoke said they have performed well in the last two years \u2013 even better than previous assemblies.\n\nAhmad Lawan, the Senate President, had set the ball rolling. In a very lengthy speech, the lawmaker praised his colleagues \u2013 listing out \u201crecord-breaking achievements.\u201d\n\nMr Lawan was elected Senate President on June 11, 2019 \u2013 shortly after the ninth assembly was inaugurated.\n\nThe inauguration was sequel to a proclamation by President Muhammadu Buhari terminating the eight assembly and marking the beginning of the ninth.\n\nIt is two years down the line. Two years of lawmaking, oversight and other necessary (and unnecessary) legislative activities.\n\nWhile the lawmakers (and some Nigerians) have scored themselves high in terms of performance, others disagree.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reviews the performance of the legislature with regards to successes and failures recorded.\n\nSUCCESSES\n\nJanuary-December budget cycle\n\nThis is now like an anthem for the ninth assembly, especially Mr Lawan.\n\nHardly does he give a speech without mentioning the fact that the ninth assembly, under his leadership, has successfully returned the country\u2019s annual budget cycle to January to December; a commendable feat compared to the recent past when budget passage extended several months into the budget year.\n\n\u201cOne of our most significant interventions in the economy is the restoration of the national annual budget to the January to December cycle which has made the nation\u2019s fiscal plans more predictable and boosted the confidence of local and foreign investors in our economy,\u201d he said last Wednesday.\n\nDelays in the passage of the national budget had been a major characteristic of previous assemblies.\n\nThe parliament had blamed the delay on late presentation of the budgets by the Executive, failure of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to appear before committees, oversight functions, among others.\n\nBesides restoring the nation\u2019s budget cycle, the 2020 budget, Mr Lawan said, has also achieved 100 per cent implementation.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that for the first time under the Fourth Republic, the budget achieved 100 per cent implementation level last year. The restoration\u2026signaled the possibilities in our country when all stakeholders are working together,\u201d he said.\n\nCordial relationship with executive\n\nArguably, this is the assembly with the most cordial relationship with the Executive in the Fourth Republic. The cordial relationship between the Lawan-led assembly and the Executive, led by President Muhammadu Buhari, is not just expressed verbally but also reflects in the activities of the lawmakers.\n\nThis is considered an achievement because when compared to other assemblies, especially the eight, these lawmakers have recorded fewer fights and disagreements with the president or members of the Executive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMany, for instance, would refer to the constant back and forth the Bukola Saraki-led Senate encountered with the president and how both parties disagreed on many issues.\n\nMany of the setbacks suffered by the eighth assembly was mainly because of the poor relationship between both arms of government.\n\nPassage of crucial bills\n\nDespite being accused of constantly embarking on holidays and delaying crucial reports, the ninth Senate has paid attention to, and passed some crucial bills \u2013 another feat Mr Lawan referenced in his speech.\n\nSome of these bills include the Deep Off-Shore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act CAP (Amendment Bill, 2009), which sought to increase Nigeria\u2019s share of the revenue from its crude oil.\n\nOther bills are the Finance Bill 2019 (Nigeria Tax and Fiscal Law), which amended seven existing tax laws and the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2004 (Repeal and Re-enactment) Bill 2019, which sought to create a legal environment conducive for ease of doing business.\n\nThey also passed the Chartered Institute of Forensic Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Establishment) Bill 2021, to boost institutional capacity for fighting corruption in Nigeria; the Public Procurement Act 2007 (Amendment) Bill, 2019 and the Public Procurement Act, 2007 (Amendment) Bill, 2019 \u2013 also to block the avenues for corruption in the procurement process by MDAs.\n\nThis, however, does not take away the fact that the lawmakers have wasted so much time on other important bills like the electoral amendment bill, the constitution amendment bills and the petroleum industry bill.\n\nIt also does not erase that the percentage of bills passed by this Senate so far is low, compared to the number of bills introduced since inauguration.\n\nOf the 742 bills introduced, only 58 have been passed. That is about eight per cent of bills introduced.\n\n\u201cAbout 355 bills have gone through first reading, 175 have gone through second reading and have been referred to the relevant committees for further legislative business, while 11 Bills referred by the House of Representatives for concurrence have also been passed,\u201d Mr Lawan noted.\n\nOne would also bear in mind that it is under this Senate that a lot of controversial bills were introduced \u2013 most of which Nigerians say are unnecessary and a misplaced priority.\n\nSome of these bills include the hate speech bill, the social media bill, and the bill to rehabilitate repentant Boko Haram members.\n\nResponse to COVID-19\n\nAlthough they \u201clocked themselves and ran away in the wake of the pandemic,\u201d as policy analyst Sam Amadi would say, the lawmakers responded to the pandemic in their capacity \u2013 by providing necessary intervention in support of the efforts of the Executive to combat the virus.\n\nTo help the nation cope with the health emergency and its dire economic consequences, they promptly revised the 2020 budget which was passed last December to accommodate funds for several COVID-19 interventions.\n\nFAILURES\n\nChecks and balances\n\nWhile the lawmakers can praise themselves for maintaining a peaceful and cordial relationship with the Executive, the ninth assembly has failed to check the excesses of the Executive \u2013 a major role the legislative arm was created to play.\n\nIn the last two years, the Lawan-led assembly has approved virtually every request sent by the Executive without thoroughly scrutinising many of them.\n\nThis is visible in some controversial appointments made by the president and sent to the National Assembly for confirmation.\n\nThey have also failed to check the excesses of executive appointees whether through sponsored deliberations or petitions.\n\nLoan requests\n\nBorrowing appears to have become synonymous with the Buhari administration. This is responsible for the nation\u2019s rising debt profile.\n\nOn several occasions, the president had asked the ninth assembly to approve local or external plans \u2013 a request the lawmakers always granted with very little or no opposition or scrutiny.\n\nIn fact, in a recent media briefing, Mr Lawan defended the president\u2019s habit of borrowing with the excuse that it was necessary to build infrastructure which will, in turn, be used to generate revenues.\n\n\u201cThe bilateral loans are even with zero per cent interest rates. Since we don\u2019t have a better option, than to accept the request, we have also started oversight functions to ensure judicious utilisation of the loans in the overall interest of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians feel that the debt burden is too heavy. It is a necessary burden, because to do otherwise will be irresponsible of any government to keep an economy that is stagnated. We have to move on. But we must also ensure that those projects, when completed, are to generate revenue to pay for the debt,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is significantly different from the attitude of the eight assembly; because lawmakers then, not only questioned the consistent request to borrow, but also rejected some requests.\n\n\u2013 Checking excesses of executive appointees and colleagues\n\nThe lawmakers have also failed to check themselves \u2013 with regards to colleagues enmeshed in one misconduct or another. Issues like these are either never discussed or discussed and forgotten.\n\nAn example is the famous and controversial case of Adamawa senator, Elisha Abbo.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how he assaulted a lady in a sex toy shop in Abuja and how even though a committee was set up to probe him for misconduct, nothing has been heard of it to date.\n\nMany other Senate committees also failed to submit crucial reports or when they did, the reports were abandoned and not worked on by the Senate.\n\nAnother example is the case of the chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Danladi Umar, who assaulted a security guard in Abuja.\n\nUntil a petition was written by the victim to the Senate, demanding a probe, the lawmakers kept mum on the matter.\n\n\u2013 Executive\u2019s non-compliance to resolutions and Senate\u2019s reluctance\n\nAlthough the harmonious relationship between the two arms of government is considered a success, it may not entirely pass for a healthy one.\n\nIt is, arguably, more like a one-sided love affair with the legislature on the giving end and the executive on the receiving end; no reciprocity.\n\nMany lawmakers have blamed the slow progress of the ninth assembly on the inability of the Executive to implement resolutions passed.\n\n\u201cYou have read the objectives we set for ourselves. We have taken many steps to achieve those objectives and since we came here, we have treated serious issues of insecurity. What have we done?\n\n\u201cWe addressed the issue. We passed resolutions. We set up committees and far-reaching resolutions passed and sent to the Executive. The fact that actions were not taken by the Executive is not our fault. We find ourselves in a situation where we are doing what is right for Nigerians and the executive is failing to implement it. That is not to say that we have not performed,\u201d Benue senator, Gabriel Suswam, said.\n\nSimilarly, a legislative expert, Desmond Akinloye, not only faulted the executive for some of the failures of the legislature but also blamed the latter for failing to wield the big stick.\n\n\u201cHow many resolutions taken by the lawmakers have been executed by the executive? The executive is not looking into it and the lawmakers cannot do more than resolutions expect they want to impeach.\n\n\u201cNormally, when resolutions are taken and the executive, whether the president or minister does not act on it, they can ask the person to leave office because it is a ground for misconduct and a valid reason to call for impeachment but it is difficult in this system,\u201d he told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nBudget padding\n\nBudget padding has gradually become a norm in the Nigerian parliament. And lawmakers seem to care less whenever they are called out for including frivolous spending in the annual budgets. The ninth assembly is no different.\n\nThere have been records of budget padding by the lawmakers in the last two years.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how the ninth assembly increased its budget from N128 billion to N136 billion and made no attempt to publish details of its allocations.\n\nThis was also despite the fact that the president had initially increased the National Assembly\u2019s budget from N125 billion in previous years, to N128 billion for 2021.\n\nThis paper also reported how the National Assembly padded the 2021 budget with over N500 billion.\n\nHolidays/lateness\n\nThe lawmakers have also cultivated a habit of embarking on frequent holidays and resuming plenary sessions late.\n\nThe senators have barely had 30 plenary sessions in 2021 alone, a poor record compared to the constitutional requirement of 181 plenary sessions in a legislative year.\n\nBetween January and June, the senators have adjourned to mourn late colleagues, for celebrations, attend to a political party\u2019s need or conduct oversight at committee levels.\n\nThis is besides the fact that they already flouted their Standing Rule which requires that they sit for three days a week (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday). For months, the lawmakers have been sitting twice a week.\n\nHowever, with the praises they have given themselves comes promises to do more. Nigerians are hopeful that the makers will do better in the coming years.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Omonhinmin\n\nNingi is a town in a local government area in Bauchi State. The Ningi Emirate comprises two local government areas. They are Ningi and Warji. It has a combined area of 5,250 kilometers and a population of 501,912 , according to the 2006 Census.\n\nThe area is inhabited mostly by Warjawa, Duwa, Ningawa and Fulanis. His Royal Majesty, Alhaji Yunusa Mohammadu Danyaya II, is the current Emir of Ningi and has been on the throne for 43 years, thus making him, one of the longest reigning Emir in Northern Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Hausa oral history, Ningi is one of the few Hausa towns in present day Northern Nigeria that was not conquered or refused to surrender to Usman Danfodio during his Jihadist invasion and Islamization of the North.\n\nThe historian says, all efforts by Danfodio to hoist his Jihadist flag in Ningi in pretext that he was trying to convert the people of Ningi to Islam was resisted by the Ningi people, who said that they were already Moslems long before the coming of Danfodio.\n\nAlhaji Ibrahim Aliyu is the Wakili Gabas, one of the ranking Chiefs in the Emir of Ningi\u2019s palace. He spoke with Palace Watch on sundry issues including the details of the meeting between His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, CFR, and His Royal Majesty, Yunusa Mohammadu Danyaya II, OON.\n\nPalace Watch: Wakili Gabas, you raised a very important issue in the course of our discussions that Ningi people repelled several attempts by Usman Danfodio, to hoist his flag in Ningi land during his Islamic Jihad crusade.\n\nAnd that the Ningi people were never conquered. Could you give us some details about this very incident?\n\nWakili Gabas: Ningi was founded by an enclave of Islamic scholars known then as Mallams in the 18th century. This is around 1847 under the leadership of Hamza.\n\n\u201cNingi leaders were hitherto called Mallams until early 19th century. Fa\u2019awa are the first tribe to gain the benefit of Western education, but the remaining tribe came to Ningi as visitors and they remain due to the abundant food items provided by the Fa\u2019awa people.\n\nMind you, these Fa\u2019awa people were never Fulanis. The Fa\u2019awa people met the Marawa people, who are the original settlers in Ningi land.\n\n\u201cAccording to oral Hausa history, the legendary Hamza migrated with forty other Mallams and their families from Tsakuwar Kano, in the present day Dawakin Kundu Local Government Area of Kano State in the year 1827.\n\nThey settled eastward at Mara, in the process, they shared themselves into two groups, Butu Kudu-Yamma district of Ningi and Lame district of the Toro Local Government Area in Bauchi State.\n\nThese Mallams were protesting the payment of a tax called Kudin Kasa in the Kano Emirate during the reign of Sarkin Kano Mohammed Bello.\n\nWhile at Mara, Sheikh Hamza used his Islamic knowledge and magic \u2013Sihr, to convince the local people under their leader called Dandaura to break their allegiance of the Amanah Agreement entered into with the Fulani Emirate in which they paid tribute \u2013Jizya to the leader.\n\nBy 1830, in order to change the status quo, Hamza had to crush Dandaura and remain the undisputed leader.\n\nHe immediately brought all the neighbouring stateless societies especially the Butawa, Fa\u2019awa Warjawa, kudawa, Sirawa, under his control.\n\n\u201cAs to be expected, this act became a threat to the peace and security of the neighbouring Emirates of Bauchi, Kano, and Zaria. As a result, Bauchi and kano combined their forces and launched an attack on Hamza.\n\nAfter the demise of Hamza, the people were not deterred, although they suffered due to Hamza\u2019s death. They remained resolute and organized themselves and selected Ahmadu in 1850 to be their leader.\n\nHamza\u2019s wife, Atta, was very influential following the death of her husband, she helped in choosing the new leader of Ningi. Ahmadu, the new leader reigned for five years and died in 1855.\n\nThe Ningi people with the great influence and political dexterity of Atta Hamza\u2019s wife, the then council of Mallams decided to choose Hamza\u2019s son-in-law, Abubakar Danmaje, as the next leader of Ningi. Unlike his predecessors, Danmaje started an expansionist policy and devised a very effective raiding strategies.\n\nDanmaje raided far and wide up to Kano, Hadejia, Katagum, Jamare, Gombe, Zaria, Birnin Gwari, Kontagora, Wukari down to Illorin, in present day Kwara state. The motives behind Danmaje raid strategy, was principally to recruit slaves into his ranks.\n\nThe ultimate result was the creation of a strong, formidable, and insurmountable force, which was commanded by him. The force, he personally commanded was known as \u201cMai Tabaryar Mshi.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can go and on, but one point that must be placed on records, is that it was the obscure location of present day Ningi town then, that gave this town its name. Ningi got its name from Butawa language, which means a \u201chiding place.\u201d\n\nAfter Danmaje\u2019s death in 1870, his successor was Haruna Karami. Haruna died in 1886 and Abubakar Gajigi was appointed the leader of the Ningi people.\n\n\u201cThen came the reign of Usman Danyaya. Usman was succeeded by Mamuda, who was under the guidance of the British. This continued with Musa Dangwido, who reign from 1905 to 1906.\n\nWe again had Mallam Mamuda from 1906 to 1908. Adamu Danyaya was the second longest reigning Emir of Ningi, having ruled for 32 years.\n\nThe present Emir, Yunusa Mohammadu Danyaya II, ascended the throne in early 1978 and has reigned for 43 years. He is so far the longest reigning Emir in Ningi.\n\n\u201cDespite the independence of the Ningi Emirates, the present Sultan, since he ascended the throne, has maintained a very cordial relationship with the Emir of Ningi.\n\nSo also is the relationship of other Emirs, who usually pass through this route when travelling from the North-East to the North-West. They usually stop over to pay courtesy visit to the Emir of Ningi.\n\n\u201cHis Eminence, the Sultan was passing over Ningi to Bauchi, where he commissioned the Hajji Camp at the Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa International Airport in Bauchi, as it has been customary, he graciously stopped over and see the Emir of Ningi.\n\nPalace Watch: Could you please let us into what the two traditional rulers discussed during their meeting.\n\nWakili Gabas: The two traditional leaders generally reviewed the ugly security situation in the country, especially as it affects our people in Northern Nigeria, and examined areas of cooperation, and see how they could be of assistance to security agencies to enable them defeat the current evil that is going on in the country in the name of insecurity.\n\nThey also seized the opportunity to look at areas in the Constitutional Review Committee work as it affects the traditional institutions and traditional rulers.\n\nThey specifically look at the areas that will accommodate the traditional ruler\u2019s inclusion in the constitution that is now under review.",

Chike Okafor, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of foreign Affair\u2019s, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, Sharon Ikeazor, Sen Julius Ucha and Sen Osita Izunaso, among others, had zero vote.\n\nNwoye, however, congratulated Ibeh on his victory, saying he is \u201ca very capable and eminent Nigerian qualified enough to steer the ship of the country.\n\nThe Enugu APC boss, added that the business mogul has distinguished himself in a number of ways and is someone we can vouch for.\n\nAccording to Nwoye, \u201cwhile I congratulate Emperor Baewood Ibeh on his victory, I must tell the others that they are all winners. Ndigbo are united to achieve a common goal in 2023, so there is no loser.\n\nHe stressed that the people of the Southeast must demonstrate seriousness in ruling this country by 2023.\n\n\u201cNobody will be in the comfort of his room and they will come and deliver Presidency to him, you must have to make a move.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have said it before that I\u2019m yet to see any Igbo man declare for that coveted position.\n\n\u201cThings don\u2019t work that way, they must step out and make declarations.\n\n\u201cFrom that point you now begin to reach out to other regions, individuals and organizations.\n\n\u201cYou cannot get the presidency by merely having wishful thinking on social media, our people must take courageous step.\n\nHe also applauded the group for carrying out the mock poll, saying it will go a long way in gingering those still relaxing in their comfort zone, but wants to be president.",

I have reasons to believe that the persistence of insecurity in Nigeria is a subtle ploy to extend Buhari\u2019s tenure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GAGG boss specifically pointed at the recent attack in Kebbi State where over 300 bandits operated freely for about eight hours without the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe recent attacks in Kebbi State where about 300 bandits with AK-47 operated for 8 hours moving from house to house, room to room, and robbing people, is a strong indication that the security architecture of the country has collapsed,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong possibility that this government may not be able to tackle insecurity headlong for Buhari to remain in power beyond 2023.

What has Buhari done to tackle insecurity apart from warnings that are not backed with actions?\n\n\u201cThe most unfortunate thing is that Buhari had since stopped reading newspapers and watching news on TV unlike before.\n\n\u201cIn essence, he has lost touch with the plight of Nigerians.

Around 10:30 in the morning, they reached their final destination \u2013 the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\u201d\n\nA Major Success\n\nSununu noted that as soon as the bandits got to the school, they were faced with a tough task as they were initially resisted and engaged in a gunfight by operatives of the Mobile Police and Police Counter-Terrorism Unit stationed at the school.\n\nHe disclosed that the fire exchange lasted for a long period before the bandits overpowered the security operatives due to their large number.\n\nThe bandits, the lawmaker stated, succeeded in killing a policeman and gained access into the school and abducted an unspecified number of students and five teachers.\n\nHe explained that it was difficult to ascertain the exact number of students abducted as parents from nearby villages and towns raced to the school to take their children away immediately after the incident.\n\nSununu, however, gave an assurance that the military has swung into action, noting that progress has been made.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs at last night, I had a discussion with the Field Commander of Operation Hadarin Daji who said that they have succeeded in entering into the den of the kidnappers and I think this is a major success because the security agencies are now taking the fight to the base of the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cI was also told that over 800 cattle that were rustled some days back have been recovered and as of now, the military has combed the area where we are expecting that the students are with the bandits. They have also succeeded in creating many casualties on the part of the bandits.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nSolomon Elusoji, Lagos\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, on Thursday said he is more at ease when visiting Maiduguri than Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nMaiduguri, the Borno state capital, is closer to Nigeria\u2019s insurgency war in the North-East.\n\nThe war has raged on for over a decade.\n\nBut Ndume, while speaking on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, said the insurgents have been kept away from the city and can only attack soft targets in other areas of Borno State.\n\n\u201cI live in Abuja and also live in Maiduguri,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I come to Maiduguri, I feel safer than in Abuja, because somebody can knock down your door with a gun. In Maiduguri, we don\u2019t hear of that.\n\n\u201cIt is outside Maiduguri where the insurgents are marauding around and attack intermittently. And that\u2019s normal with insurgents, that\u2019s why they are called insurgents, they do hit and run on soft targets.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that \u201cin every society, you can\u2019t wipe out criminality completely. In America, there is school shooting.

Our security agencies are up to the task; Our security agencies are up to the task and ready for them. They have engaged themselves and (ISWAP) have suffered serious casualties.\u201d",

To be completely honest, my dream was always to play for Brazil, to wear this shirt. I never imagined I would reach these numbers.\u201d\n\nPele later wrote on Instagram: \u201cToday, he took another step towards my goalscoring record for the national team.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m rooting for him to get there, with the same joy I\u2019ve had since I saw him play for the first time.\u201d\n\nBrazil face Colombia next on 23 June before completing their Group B fixtures against Ecuador.\n\nFour teams from each of the five-team groups will progress to the quarter-final stage.",
