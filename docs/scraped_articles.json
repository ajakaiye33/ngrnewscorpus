Therefore, the blood of our innocent youths killed by agents of the APC and its administration must not be shed in vain. Those responsible for these callous acts must be made to face justice.\n\n\u201cOf course, all those whose hands have become blood stained will never know peace.\n\n\u201cThe PDP hereby invites Nigerians to stand for our slain compatriots by ensuring that those behind the massacre of our youths as well as their supporters in government have their days in the dock.\n\n\u201cThe nation must ensure that such individuals are brought to book for their act of wickedness to humanity.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, our party insists that all those indicted by the panel should be arrested, prosecuted and dealt with in accordance with our laws.\n\n\u201cThe PDP again commiserates with the families of the slain young Nigerians, who were cut in their prime for demanding for a just, equitable and secure nation governed by the rule of law.\u201d",

Tukur Buratai will face the International Criminal Court over the Lekki tollgate massacre.\n\nAdeyanju said this when he appeared on Arise TV on Tuesday following the release of the report of the Panel of Investigation set up by the Lagos State Government to unravel the incidents of October 20, 2020 at the popular Lekki Toll Gate, Lagos State.\n\nThe report released during the week had indicted the police and soldiers of the Nigerian Army of having killed and maimed armless youths protesting illicit police activities and bad governance in Nigeria.\n\nMajor General Taiwo, who appeared before the Panel during the investigation, according to the report, had told the panel that the soldiers acted on the command of Buratai, who in turn got instruction from the Commander in Chief, President Buhari.\n\nAlso note that before the release of the report, the Federal Government through the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, had in a series of press conferences continually denied that any one was killed when soldiers invaded the protest scene.\n\nDespite the Federal government stance, the report shows obvious evidence that there was indeed a massacre at the Lekki tollgate.\n\n\u201c\u2026More information about the massacre against humanity committed by the army led by Lit. Gen Turner Buratai would be sent to the International Criminal Court, ICC,\u201d Adeyanju said.\n\n\u201cWe demand that arrest warrant should be issued against him and that he should be prosecuted because we believe that Maj. General Buhari government will not prosecute the perpetrators of this crime.\n\n\u201cWe are calling that other officers who participated actively in the Lekki massacre be prosecuted.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about international law is that it says that even after the command has been given for the massacre, those who refuse to take action against the perpetrators would also be liable.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army is liable in all these atrocities and it sll falls on the table of the President. The President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces is guilty of the crime against humanity and the Nigerian people as witnessed at the Lekki tollgate and we must all call it what it is.\n\n\u201cAnd the good thing again is the even the Heads of State are not protected from arrest warrant issued against them by the international criminal court.\n\n\u201cSo the attempt by the Muhammadu Buhari regime to shield Buratai by offering diplomatic immunity does not survive in this case.\n\n\u201cBuratai is the one who was responsible for killing people at the tollgate acting on the instruction of President Buhari and Brig. Gen. Taiwo has told the panel.\n\n\u201cIt is in the report. So ICC does not need further evidence. The ICC must step in.

          "title": "Retro-Review of Grand Theft Auto V",
          "text": "Since its release in 2013, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) V, developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, has gone on to become one of the highest grossing video games ever and thought to be \u2018the most financially successful entertainment product of all time, with about $6 billion in worldwide revenue\u2019. Not only that, it has received awards such as VGX Award for Game of the Year, BAFTA Games Award for British Game, amongst other important awards in the video game industry. It is gamers\u2019 favourite that millions have played or enjoy re-playing again and again. One can even say it is an initiation rite \u2013 you don\u2019t have a bragging right as a gamer if you\u2019ve never played any of the Grand Theft Auto series.\n\nSo, what really endears GTA V to gamers? It is simple: the story. At the core of this action-adventure open world game is the simple story of three friends in the contemporary world of the fictionalised city of Los Santos. The city itself, modelled after Los Angeles, is a parody of contemporary American city with all its absurdities and vices. The popular axiom that it is people who make a city cannot be truer. The game\u2019s cityscape has different temperaments of many people that inhabit it.\n\nIn the three-lead protagonists plot and gaming experience, first, we are introduced to Franklin Clinton, a black male who works at a car dealership with his friend, Lamar. The game is very literalistic of the average black man living in an American city\u2019s downtown. Getting around the gameplay from the beginning, we see that Franklin is very ambitious and wants to escape the violence of his neighbourhood. He doesn\u2019t want a life of gangbangers like his friend, Lamar, but wants to \u2018chase papers\u2019 and sees his life not significantly going anywhere by merely running a series of errands for his dishonest and manipulative Armenian boss.\n\nJust as we are about investing time on him, we are introduced to another pivotal character, Michael De Santa, when Franklin went to repossess the car sold to Michael\u2019s son \u2013 which was more like steal \u2013 under the directive of his Armenian boss. On Franklin\u2019s drive back to his boss\u2019s office, Michael leaps up suddenly from the back seat with a gun to his head. The instruction is clear: he should ram the car into his boss\u2019 office or blow up his head and do it himself anyway. Franklin rams the vehicle into his boss\u2019s office and so begins his friendship with Michael.\n\nNow, Michael is a depressed or at best described as a restless or lacklustre husband and father. He is always seeking the attention and connection with his family, especially his kids, who are millennia and this difference in their cultural values frequently test their cohesion and commitment as a family.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn his return home after the episode with Franklin, Michael finds his wife cheating on him with her tennis coach. He enlists Franklin\u2019s hand in chasing after the guy and destroys what he thought to be his home, not knowing it actually belongs to a mafia boss. To pay back the mafia boss, he is forced back into a world he left a long time ago \u2013 the world of heists. He connects back with an old friend called Lester and carefully plans and pulls the score with Franklin. But the heist is riddled with too much of his signatures as a money mover. The heist violates the secret deal he made with an FIB agent (yeah, a parody of the FBI) to stay completely off the grid.\n\nThis also alerts Trevor Philips, his old buddy in the desert town of San Andreas on the outskirts of Los Santos, who has been searching for his whereabouts. The prologue that opens the game about a heist gone wrong is put into perspective now. Originally, there were three friends involved in a bank robbery all presumed dead: Michael Townley (now living under alias of Michael De Santa), Trevor Philips and Brad Snider.\n\nIn this cut scene introducing Trevor, he is doing a quickie on a girl, thrusting her from behind (yeah, the game is rated M17+), when the news on the t.v. catch his attention and stop mid stroke to pull on his pants. The cinematics of this scene appropriately deserves commendation from the producers. A movie can\u2019t do better. The room setting is a complete mess reflecting the personality of Trevor. The look on Trevor\u2019s face, too, is as if he had just seen a ghost. In fact, this is what he said when the boyfriend of the girl come charging that no matter what, whether under the influence of drug or no drug, he shouldn\u2019t be \u2018fucking\u2019 his girlfriend. Trevor is enraged.\n\nThe rap artiste, The Game sings on the lyrics of \u2018Let\u2019s Ride\u2019 contorting his face, clenching his teeth with vehemence, his signature look, leaving a threat hanging with the declaration:\n\n\u2018I\u2019m The Game, homie\n\nCall your girl, she ain\u2019t home\n\nShe with The Game, homie.\u2019\n\nWe don\u2019t get to see this violence act out in his music video in a scenario like this, but in this cut scene, Trevor acts out this violence as if bearing the lyrics of The Game in mind. He breaks a bottle on the boyfriend\u2019s face and repeatedly stamps on his head till his brain matter gets stuck under his boot. In fact, let\u2019s hear the dialogue here:\n\nJonny: Trevor, you been with my girl again! I\u2019m talking to you, asshole.\n\nRon: Don\u2019t do it, Jonny. I told him, Trevor, I told him.\n\n(Trevor walks past them holding a beer bottle)\n\nJonny: We all get high! We all get high! But that don\u2019t make it right! (He runs after him) Trevor! I\u2019m talking to you motherfucker.\n\nTrevor: (Turns back) Are you? What\u2019re you sayin?\n\nJonny: (Calms down) Fucking my girl, man, it\u2019s wrong.\n\nTrevor: Oh, I gotta fuck someone. You want me to fuck you instead? Is that the problem here? Take off your pants, cowboy, let\u2019s fuck.\n\nJonny: You think this is funny?\n\nTrevor: Get them off!\n\n(Ron, Wade and Jonny\u2019s girlfriend rushes towards them)\n\nRon: I told him to leave it, Trevor. I told him, \u2018Leave it; leave it.\u2019\n\nTrevor: Shut up! I\u2019m about to fuck me a meth head in a cowboy, get my boy sucked in from his toothless gum. Hmmm.\n\nJonny: Fuck you, Trevor. I still love her.\n\nTrevor grabs him by the neck and throws him on the ground. He bends over him and smashes his beer bottle on his face and stamps aggressively on his face. Well, this is Trevor for you.\n\nUnlike the other two characters, Trevor is a total psychopath, full of dirty language. But he is unpretentious like the other two. He is always in dirty clothing, wherever he is inhabiting is most likely in total disarray. The player will soon understand what accounts for this as little snippets from his childhood are talked about in conversations during the gameplay. Interestingly, Trevor is the character many gamers will identify with because he gives the pleasures of gunfight and interesting missions, unlike Michael who is always seeking his family\u2019s love and attention. Or not to talk of that daunting mission of attending flight school in order to learn how to fly aircraft.\n\nHe tracks down Michael and arrives at his doorstep, claiming to be his \u2018nemesis\u2019. He forces his way back into Michael\u2019s life and soon gets to know Franklin, too. Despite his flaws, his psychopathy and the fact that he can be a bully, like I said earlier, Trevor is that character that can easily warm his way into people\u2019s hearts.\n\nThe arc of friendship is completed and they begin pulling scores, heists, first to help Michael out then to fulfil their greed. But along the line, they must also redeem their souls from the FIB agents who they must always do their bidding. It is this that will solidify the bond amongst the three friends and threaten to render asunder the bond. How to navigate the decision at the end of the game will become a burden or rather a precarious choice left to the gamer which makes the game even more interactive. The ending is not a neat and programmed one that a gamer must casually see through. It is a three-choice left to the gamer and by that you can play the game again and again with various endings in mind. But no matter the outcome you choose, a gamer most likely will experience a kind of lull that will spread this feeling of absurdism all over him. In this regard, the video game achieves its purpose about the meaninglessness of success.\n\nGTA V is an extremely entertaining video game with its life-like graphics and real world topics that are engaged and parodied in the game from climate change, legalisation of marijuana, and invasive social media. It is a visual satire of modern society and liberalism with immersive dialogue and action. Even the gamers who sit all day indoors behind their monitor instead of going out and meeting real people are not spared the satire. With more than 72 chapters, you\u2019re sure to enjoy the gameplay and different side-missions whether you are parachuting, scuba diving, helping some random strangers in distress on the street, practising yoga, cycling, boat racing, planning heists and fighting rival gangs, smuggling arms and drugs in airplanes, etc. With its whole cast of diverse characters: crackheads, racists, homophobes, drug lords, anti-immigrants, corrupt police agents, etc. it mirrors most of the complexities of the contemporary world. GTA V shows an immersive world is possible in a video game. The scriptwriters \u2013 Dan Houser, Rupert Humphries, Michael Unsworth \u2013 wrote incredible and memorable dialogues that will get under your skin. No matter who you are, if you love a good story, you will love Grand Theft Auto V.\n\nWith GTA VI rumoured to be in the making, it is important to point out things that the game developers must work on. Driving is still terrible in the game. It is absurd knocking off traffic lights, electric poles, post boxes, people on the street with no consequence of infraction or something all because stirring a vehicle is as slippery as oil. Even a first-shooter game, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, has a better driving simulation in that chapter of the game where there is a short driving stint, likewise a similar open world game, Watchdogs. The game critic Keza McDonald noted this, too, in her review, \u2018The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts.\u2019 Nevertheless, by comparison, the glitch-ridden CyberPunk2077 just released last year still can\u2019t beat GTA V. And the one cool thing about driving for this gamer is the varieties of radio channels available for selection, the different genres of music through these channels, the discussions of the city happenings and sometimes real world topics that are debated by radio DJs is stimulating.\n\nThe Grand Theft Auto series can only get better and better from here with improved graphics by the game developers at Rockstar North. When the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S was recently launched, a whole lot of gamers were looking forward to GTA VI but were disappointed when they learned it was still the same old GTA V that came with the consoles only with graphic improvement and some additional chapters. In addition to this, it was announced Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, a remastered version of the previous editions of the game, will be released on the new consoles later this November. Probably these are only paving the way for GTA VI.\n\nNow, perhaps, it is only right to sound this to African writers and creatives of the enormous opportunity in the video game industry. Last year, during the lockdown, the British Council in Lagos, too, hosted a webinar on the gaming industry and how Africans can participate. It is because the gaming industry is a vast enterprise that is worth billions of dollars. But it is acutely lacking in African imagination even though at the end of some video games you will see some Nigerian names on the credit roll. It would be interesting to have a first-shooter game like the Call of Duty franchise, for instance, adapt Chimananda Adichie\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun in their series. Because it is not enough that a whole chapter in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is set in a futuristic Lagos. Also, the overt fixation on Greek and other western mythologies in fantasy games is hegemonic in cultural space as can already be seen in the Marvel Studios outputs. It would be an interesting departure adapting African mythology, like the Ozidi saga for instance, in some games. But all these cannot be done without some interest from our cultural powerhouse. African script writers and creatives must make an effort to step in.",

Whether it is a true report, I can\u2019t tell.\n\n\u201cBut I will like to indicate that normal procedure is to have such a report submitted to the convening authority and then there will be a white paper that will be presented on the basis of which one can make informed comments.\u201d\n\nGeneral Irabor said, \u201cWhatever it is currently, I will like to indicate that the Armed Forces of Nigeria is a professional Armed Forces. We are peopled by Nigerians and we remain committed to our constitutional mandate. So, we do not at this point think that Nigerians should make disparaging remarks regarding the Armed Forces of Nigeria in the sense that we are a professional armed forces. If there are issues, of course we will address them within the ambit of the provisions.\u201d\n\nInsisting that it will not be right to disparage men who work so hard to ensure that the territorial integrity of Nigeria is kept in tact. Gen. Irabor said, \u201cIn the meantime, until I see the full extent of the report I may not be able to (comment). But I can assure you that the armed forces of Nigeria, we are all disciplined and we do not engage in any ignoble act. \u201c\n\nSpeaking further, he said if they did not enjoy the trust of Nigerians, the armed forces would not have been doing what they were doing.\n\n\u201cAnd in any case, remember it is the armed forces of Nigeria. We are not talking about the police, we are talking about the armed forces, with emphasis, the ARMED FORCES. So when the armed forces are called out, it is because there is a need for the armed forces,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) set up by the Lagos state government to probe the October 20, 2020 #EndSARs protest had in its report submitted to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Monday revealed that at least 11 persons were killed during the peaceful demonstration at the Lekki Tollgate and another four missing but presumed dead, making a total of 15 dead persons.\n\nThe report, which also called the Lekki Tollgate shootings of October 20, 2020, \u201ca massacre,\u201d was an incriminating indictment of heightening extrajudicial killings and unprofessionalism by Nigerian law enforcement agents\n\nThe report described as \u201catrocious\u201d, the maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor, waving their Nigerian flags and singing the National Anthem, stressing that the act could be equated to a \u201cmassacre in context.\u201d\n\nWatch video\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Emefiele: CBN Disbursed $3trn Loans to Nigerian Businesses in One Year to Cushion Impact of Covid-19",
          "text": "By Nume Ekeghe in Lagos and Emma Addey in Abuja\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele, has revealed that the apex bank has so far distributed about $3 trillion to households, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), smallholder farmers, pharmaceutical companies as a buffer against the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with Arise TV on the sidelines of the Intra-African Trade Fair, 2021, holding in Durban, South Africa, Emefiele noted that the insinuation that the CBN was overreaching its statutory bounds, was baseless, explaining that the bank had continued to play its monetary role effectively.\n\nHe pointed out that the job of the CBN was to complement the efforts of the fiscal side, emphasising that it had never happened in the country where the bank will lend funds for a tenure of 10 years with a two-year moratorium, like the CBN had done in recent times.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you this, between 2020 and now, our data shows that we have disbursed at least N2 trillion, almost N3 trillion in loans to households, to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions.\n\n\u201cWe have also given these funds to some of our large agricultural companies that want to get back again to business, to manufacturing companies who are accessing long term 10 years loan with two-year moratorium with single digit rate. I have data that shows we are playing our part,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele also reiterated that the monetary policy and fiscal policy were working hand in hand to grow the economy.\n\nHe noted that with every developmental policy and initiative from the Presidency, the CBN and its fiscal counterpart, the Ministry of Finance, collaborate to achieve set goals.\n\nHe added that the new financial instrument, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d would aid President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s vision to create 10 million jobs.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you ask Finance Minister, we are always in contact and she would tell you that there are no issues about the relationship between the Monetary and Fiscal authority. So, when people say there is no synergy, again, I wonder where that is coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen COVID hit, Mr. President tasked the finance minister and I to work together to bring an immediate response and I went back to the Bankers Committee to which we came up with immediate response. And the Minister of Finance and I had opportunities several times to go back to brief the President. So it is left for you to respond whether there is collaboration between monetary and fiscal authority there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, after that, the President said that we should establish economic sustainability program (ESP) chaired by the Vice President. The central bank played an active part in the development of that program to the extent that the fiscal authorities were only meant to contribute N500 billion and monetary authorities were left to provide almost about N1.5 trillion. Please let me correct this not as grant but as loans to support people who were impacted by COVID-19 so they can get their businesses back.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cOur job is to compliment and that is why after every why at every opportunity when we hold a monetary policy committee meeting, we read out what we have done to compliment the efforts of the fiscal, and data is there.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, on what the CBN had done to cushion the economic effect of Covid-19 pandemic, he added the bank had disbursed loans close to N3 trillion to household and businesses since 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you this, in 2020 till date our data shows that we have disbursed close to at least N3 trillion in loans to households, to micro small and medium enterprises, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions. Also, to some of our larger agricultural companies that want to get back again on to business, to manufacturing companies who are now accessing long term 10-year loans with two year moratorium at single digit rate.\u201d\n\nFurther on the recent \u201c100 for 100\u201d policy, he said: \u201cAgain, the 100 for 100 is another program that came up out of the need to say that we must support more, do everything to create employment for our people. And that\u2019s why if you read the framework, we said employment, we said we must see measurable level of employment that would be provided by that projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have to be new projects and the central bank will do everything possible to provide foreign exchange to import plants and machinery. And by the time the plant or machinery are set up, import of raw material would be near zero so that we can begin look at our available local raw material, rather than importing them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is meant again to compliment what Mr. president said that we had to create 10 million jobs in 10 years.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is time for Nigeria to stop relying on a country or economy dependent on oil and we must diversify the economy into the non-oil sectors of our economy. We must deepen our economy so that we can truly position ourselves as a country that is self sufficient. Self sufficiency has to do with what we talk about in the economy of import substitution, industrialization, which is produce to feed yourself, and then export.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nume Ekeghe\n\nThe World Bank has stated that the destruction caused by the Boko Haram sect caused economic activities in the north-eastern part of the country to decline by 50 per cent.\n\nThe multilateral institution noted that Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states which are in the Lake Chad region saw economic activities decline from 10 to 14 per cent between 2009 and 2013, adding that the region has recorded 50 per cent decline in activities from 2018.\n\nSpeaking at the Launch of the Lake Chad regional economic memorandum, Lead Economist, World Bank and Co-author of the report, Mr. Marco Hernandez said: \u201cIn northern Nigeria, we see that 50 per cent or more of crop yields have been affected as a result of conflict, there is a huge cost that could very well turns into a benefit because that takes into account other factors that have been going on at the time, including, for instance, issues related to climate.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the effects of Boko Haram alone, once again, you now isolate it from all the different things that are going on in the region, what we have seen is that there are two messages to highlight on the one hand, that economic activity has fallen and the large reduction in economic activity has become even more apparent with time.\n\n\u201cIt used to be 10 to 14 per cent of reduced economic activity when Boko Haram was just starting, but now closer to 2018 and so it has been closer to 50 per cent of economic activity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBoko Haram is not just on those places where insurgency happens, it also affects neighbouring parts for where the actual attack happens as well.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, for the region to grow, the bank called for enhanced trade, improved infrastructure to move people good and services, improved governance and management of natural resources.\n\nHe added: \u201cNow, when we take into account that security as an underlying precondition for developing the Lake Chad region, we focus on four key areas that we believe are essential to help break that cycle.\n\n\u201cThe first one is trade facilitation; the ability to move goods and services from one place to another; connected infrastructure specially to make it easier for those goods and services to move in and including labour as well.\n\n\u201cThe third area is governance and the importance that it has across all the different development challenges that Lake Chad region faces. And the fourth one is about natural resource management.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Country Director for Nigeria, World Bank, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri advised Nigeria to urgently tackle insecurity to enhance growth especially in the north-east.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think especially for an institution like the World Bank, you know we are for development and for that, we need peace and security to proceed with development.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Reveals 24 injured, 15 assaulted, 96 corpses found across states\n\n\u2022Says Army refused to allow medical help for the wounded\n\n\u2022Recommends various sanctions for accused officers\n\n\u2022Indicts LCC for manipulation of videos\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu sets up implementation c\u2019ttee, submits report to NEC\n\nSegun James in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn a damning report released yesterday, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) set up by the Lagos state government to probe the October 20, 2020 #EndSARs protest has revealed that at least 11 persons were killed during the peaceful demonstration at the Lekki Tollgate and another four missing but presumed dead making a total of 15.\n\nThe report, which also called the Lekki Tollgate shootings of October 20, 2020, \u201ca massacre,\u201d was an incriminating indictment of heightening extrajudicial killings and unprofessionalism by Nigerian law enforcement agents\n\nThe report described as \u201catrocious\u201d, the maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor, waving their Nigerian flags and singing the National Anthem, stressing that the act could be equated to a \u201cmassacre in context.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, aside the 11 confirmed dead, four others were presumed dead, while in all 48 were casualties of the Lekki incident which shook the entire country last year.\n\nOf the 48 casualties listed, the panel stated that 24 sustained gunshot injuries, while 15 others were assaulted by soldiers and police, revealing that 96 other corpses were presented by a Forensic Pathologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Prof. John Obafunwa.\n\nIn the 309-page report, which specifically indicted the soldiers and the police, the panel stated that it unravelled the fact that after the Nigerian Army exited the scene, the Nigeria Police Force, followed up with the killing of the protesters, shooting directly at fleeing protesters who had run into the shanties and the Lagoon.\n\nStating that a number of unidentified bodies were removed by security agencies and the Lagos State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit (LASEHMU) and deposited at various hospital mortuaries in Lagos State, the panel stressed that trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Tollgate in the morning of October 21, to clean up the scene and conceal evidence.\n\nThe panel comprised a retired Judge of the Lagos State High Court, Justice Doris Okuwobi as Chairperson, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), a retired Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), Taiwo Lakanu, Patience Patrick-Udoh (Representative Civil Society), \u2018Segun Awosanya and Oluwatoyin Odusanya.\n\nOthers were Lucas Koyejo, Majekodunmi Oluwaseun and Mr. Babajide Boye, who acted as secretary .\n\nThe two-volume document which were presented to the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos House, Ikeja, a copy of which was obtained by THISDAY, called for the establishment of a body to look at human rights abuses in Lagos because it could not hear all the petitions submitted to it.\n\nAccording to the panel, there were evidences of cover-up by the Army when they removed the corpses of the fallen protesters with their vans.\n\nThe Panel stated that Army should never have been deployed in the first place since the protest was largely peaceful. \u201cin the light of all the above that issue of whether or not the Army kept to any particular rules of engagement is immaterial since the invitation of the Army to Lagos state and the deployment of the Army to Lekki Toll Gate in the first place was totally unwarranted. The Army should on no account be deployed against unarmed.\u201d\n\nThe panel also found out that most of the 96 corpses for which autopsies were conducted by the state\u2019s chief pathologist, Obafunwa, remained unidentified but were labelled #Endsars, lending credence to the belief that the shooting by security agencies resulted in mass deaths.\n\nSpecifically, it recommended disciplinary actions against one Lt. Col S.O. Bello and Major General Godwin Umelo, who refused to honour the summons of the panel in order to frustrate the investigation.\n\nIt declared that all officers (excluding Maj. Gen. Omata) and men of the Nigerian Army that were deployed to the Lekki tollgate on the date should be made to face appropriate disciplinary action, stripped of their status, and dismissed as they are not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation.\n\nThe panel stated that all those arrested in the course of the protest should be granted bail, prosecuted for any offence that may be alleged against them or where no prima facie evidence of culpability is disclosed upon due investigation, should be released forthwith.\n\nIt also recommended that the Nigeria Army should be discouraged from intervening in internal security of the country forthwith.\n\nPanel\u2019s terms of reference\n\nAmong others, the body was set up to identify victims of abuse, brutality and extra judicial killings in the hands of officers of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and officers of the Nigeria Police and to carry out investigative duties in respect of petitions received on police brutality and extra-judicial killings in Lagos State\n\nIn addition, it was to evaluate evidence and draw conclusions on the validity of such petitions received; to determine and recommend compensation for verifiable/deserving victims and their dependents; and to interrogate serving or dismissed officers of the disbanded SARS and the police responsible for the abuse of victims and recommend their prosecution\n\nIn summary, the panel\u2019s duty also involved unravelling whether the Nigerian Army used live bullets on unarmed and defenceless protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on 20th October 2020 and whether the live bullets resulted in injuries or casualties on the part of the protesters.\n\nFurthermore, it was to find out whether the police was at the tollgate on the night of the 20th of October 2020 and the morning of the 21st of October 2020 and whether they shot at unarmed and defenceless protesters.\n\nAs part of its terms of reference, the panel also probed whether the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) played any role in the events of the night of the 20th of October 2020 and generally whether the Lagos State played any role in the Lekki Tollgate incident.\n\nKey findings\n\nThe Okuwobi-led panel noted that it found out indeed the Nigerian Army was indeed invited for intervention in the state and was deployed to the Lekki Tollgate on the said date, saying the invitation of the armed was unwarranted.\n\nAt the Lekki tollgate, it noted that during the probe, it discovered that \u201cofficers of the Nigerian Army shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenceless protesters, without provocation or justification.\u201d\n\nIt pointed out all these happened while the peaceful demonstrators, \u201cwere waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the National Anthem,\u201d adding that \u201cthe manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre.\u201d\n\nThe panel also found that the conduct of the Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance and did not adhere to its own rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cThe panel found that the Nigerian Police Force deployed its officers to the Lekki tollgate on the night of the 20th October, 2020 and between that night and the morning of the 21st of October, 2020, its officers shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths. The police officers also tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets.\n\n\u201cThe panel found that the LCC hampered the panel\u2019s investigation by refusing to turn over some useful and vital information/evidence as requested by the panel and the forensic expert engaged by the panel, even where such information and evidence was by the company\u2019s admission, available. It manipulated the incomplete CCTV video footage of the Lekki Tollgate on the night of the 20th of October 2020, which it tendered before the panel,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt stated that there was indeed an invitation of the Nigerian Army to Lagos State by the state government through the governor before the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army deployed its soldiers to the scene on the said night.\n\nIt added that there was an attempt to cover up the incident by the cleaning of the Lekki scene and the failure to preserve the scene ahead of potential investigations.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn all, the panel made a total of 32 recommendations, which included sanctioning of the officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police Force respectively who participated in shooting, injuring and killing of unarmed protestors at the Lekki tollgate on the 20 and 21st of October 2020;\n\nIt also called for the development of more robust engagement between the youth and the government and the setting up of a standing committee/tribunal to deal with cases of violation of human rights by security agencies and a trust fund to settle compensation awarded by such tribunal.\n\nIt added: \u201cThere should be a public apology to #ENDSARS protesters who were killed, injured and traumatised by the incident of the 20th of October 2020 and the memorialisation of the Lekki Tollgate and the 20th of October going forward.\n\n\u201cThe recognition of hospitals and medical doctors who played heroic roles following the Incident of the Lekki tollgate on the 20th of October 2020 thereby saving lives and minimising the impact of the injuries suffered by the victims, most of which were on a pro-bono basis.\u201d\n\nThe panel further recommended various sums of compensation to victims of the Lekki incident, which must be expeditious in order to accelerate the healing process, insisting that any data that may have been generated over the years on the impunity of the police across Nigeria be studied and deployed as early warning signs (EWS) mechanism.\n\nThe panel stated that it had the cooperation of most stakeholders save for the Nigerian Army and some others who ignored summons issued by the panel and lauded those represented by their counsel , including, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) , counsel to the various groups of ENDSARS protesters, counsel to Lagos State Government, and counsel to the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt listed its greatest limitation as time, as it had to undertake its investigation into the Lekki tollgate incident alongside other petitions in respect of police brutality related matters.\n\nThe panel also recommended that the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the Maroko police station along with policemen deployed from Maroko should be prosecuted for arbitrary and indiscriminate shooting and killing of protesters.\n\nSanwo-Olu Sets up implementation committee, submits report to NEC,\n\nFollowing the report, the governor has vowed that his government would implement the recommendations of the panel.\n\nSpeaking when he received the report of the panel, Sanwo-Olu immediately constituted a four-member committee led by Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo to raise a white paper on the report within two weeks.\n\nAccording to him, the committee was expected to produce the document to be considered by the Lagos State executive council, pledging that the reports and recommendations would be made public and submitted to the National Economic Council (NEC) for discussion.\n\nThe committee has the Commissioner for Youths and Social Development, Mr. Segun Dawodu; Special Adviser, Works and Infrastructure, Mrs. Aramide Adeyoye and Permanent Secretary, Cabinet Office, Mrs. Tolani Oshodi as members.\n\n\u201cThe four of them will very quickly, look through and bring forward a white paper within the next two weeks that will be considered at the Lagos State Executive Council and would be gazetted as a white paper coming from the panel of enquiry,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe governor assured that all the recommendations in the submitted reports would be treated, even as he expressed optimism that the government\u2019s decision on the reports would bring healing, reconciliation and restitution.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure that the recommendations that are coming out that will be turned into a white paper will be made available to the public. We will do it appropriately, so that history will judge us well.\n\n\u201cWe will have a document that will stand the test of time, that\u2019s what the tribunal law says, so that it will be properly documented and gazetted in government\u2019s records\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the Panel, Okuwobi ,expressed appreciation to the state government and all the stakeholders who appeared before the panel and the team for uncommon resolve and good team work.\n\nOkuwobi, who disclosed that the panel awarded a total of N410 million to 70 victims of police brutality, said 235 petitions were received with only 14 being on the alleged Lekki shooting incident.\n\n\u201cAs much as the panel desired to have taken all petitions, the ones that were not taken by the panel were those that did not comply with our rules. So, in this report, we made recommendations for a body to take over human rights abuse cases in Lagos State\u201d she said.\n\nMonetary Cost of the Year Long Investigation, N800 million\n\nSources within Alausa yesterday hinted to THISDAY the cost implication of the year\u2019s long investigation. It cost the state government a whopping N800 million to ensure the panel did not experience any funding issues that might have hindered the conclusion of its enquiry.\n\nA competent source within Alausa told THISDAY last night that, Sanwo-Olu had immediately matched his promise with action by flying to Abuja after receiving the report to submit it to the National Economic Council (NEC).\n\n\u201cSo two things the governor promised, he is already doing; one to set up a panel to review the report and come up with a white paper that will give teeth to government action and two, he promised to submit the report to NEC, which he did yesterday, after receiving the panel\u2019s report. He flew to Abuja to submit it to NEC. So, action is already being taken. As you can see there was complete independence of the panel,\u201d the source added.\n\nSanwo-Olu had on October 19, 2020, inaugurated the panel to investigate alleged cases of brutality and human rights violations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Monday lauded Africa\u2019s collaborative journey towards collective economic prosperity through the African Continental Free Trade Area, adding that \u201cAfrica must be a marketplace where no country is left behind.\u201d\n\nIn his address Monday at the opening ceremony of the Intra-African Trade Fair 2021 at Durban, South Africa, President Buhari said \u201cunder the African Continental Free Trade Area, we can double our intra-Africa trade by 2030, reduce our reliance on imports and therefore create more jobs within the continent.\u201d\n\nHe said he Iooked forward to seeing more African products manufactured in Africa using African resources, noting that AFCFTA is for \u201cmade-in-Africa\u201d products and services.\n\nThe President said most of Africa\u2019s existing challenges, whether security, economy or corruption, confronting Africa can be traced to the continent\u2019s inability over the years to domesticate the production of its most basic requirements and provide jobs to its teeming and dynamic youth population.\n\nHe however warned that this goal cannot be achieved by talking alone.\n\n\u201cThe implementation will be a difficult journey. But all challenges are surmountable if both the public and private sectors collaborate,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cAs we implement, we must ensure that we create jobs and enhance revenues for all parties. We must leverage on one another\u2019s strengths to succeed.\u201d\n\nThe President also said business people must key into existing regional value chains or build new ones, either to extend operations into the higher value segments of their industries or to satisfy the area\u2019s rules of origin requirements.\n\nNoting that Free Trade must also be fair, Buhari said fairness can only be achieved when there is full compliance with regulations especially those relating to rules of origin.\n\n\u201cThe Intra-Africa Trade Fair is uniquely positioned to help in these areas,\u201d he added.\n\nCommenting on the benefits of the Trade Fair, Buhari said, \u201cThrough these gatherings, we will be laying a solid foundation for future business-to-business, business and government, and government to government co-operation.\u201d\n\nAssuring participants that Nigeria came to Durban in full force to actively participate in the trade fair and take full advantage of all the opportunities it provides.\n\nThe President, while assuring participants that Nigeria is open for business, said: \u201cWe have streamlined the country\u2019s participation under one-roof to enable you access all the information you need.\n\n\u201cAs many of you are aware, in the past five years, Nigeria has made significant strides towards the diversification of her economy from an oil revenue dependent country to a nation with diverse revenue sources.\n\n\u201cWe were able to achieve this by putting in place fiscal, monetary and trade policies that support investments and investors in key sectors such as Agriculture, Mining, Telecommunications and Digital Economy, Banking and Financial services, tourism, and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe also introduced reforms in key institutions as well as policies to fight corruption and ease the way of doing business in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated the African Union Commission, the AFCFTA Secretariat and the Africa Export Import Bank for their dedication and relentless effort in seeing this very worthy initiative become a reality.\n\nHe also commended the people of Durban for hosting this year\u2019s intra-African trade fair and expressed hope that it will witness milestone agreements among African businesses at this gathering.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Professor Ishaq Akintola represents a religious god that went to Hell and back. If you had been following his bigoted religious divisive and explosive statements, you\u2019ll agree with my characterization.\n\nAkintola is the director Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC). On 2023 presidential candidates, he said Yoruba Muslims will not vote for Christian candidates from southwest in 2023. \u201cAs public discourse on Nigerians zeroes in on 2023 presidential election, we see the need for us to reiterate our position on the need for a Yoruba Muslim presidential candidate from southwest.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that \u201cIt has been persecution and stigmatization galore for Yoruba Muslims since independence. They are denied almost all civil liberties. Admission seekers who are Muslims are denied attractive courses in tertiary institutions. It is easier for an elephant to pass through a needle\u2019s eye than for a Yoruba Muslim graduate to secure employment. Yoruba Muslims are marginalized in political appointments.\u201d Akintola claimed that the developer of the collapsed 21-storey building in Lagos rejected an engineer because he\u2019s a Muslim.\n\nRecently, Traditional Religious Worshippers Association (TRAWSO) gave the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, 21-day ultimatum to publicly apologize to TRAWSO for disrespecting traditional religion. Oluwo does not believe in Yoruba deities and will have nothing to do with them. He said celebrating deities belittled traditional rulers: \u201cA king must celebrate the King of all Kings. A king must not celebrate lesser gods but God almighty,\u201d says Oluwo. TRAWSO planned to invade Iwo town and will depose the monarch from the ancestral throne if their demands were not fully met.\n\nIn response, Akintola said MURIC condemned the threats. \u201cWe note with deep concern that traditionalists in Yorubaland prefer to monopolise Muslim traditional rulers in such a way that the latter pay no attention to Islam and Muslims but concentrate on traditional rites alone,\u201d said Akintola.\n\nAkintola has failed to support his allegations of discrimination and marginalization of Yoruba Muslims with verifiable proofs. Rather, he turns the truth upside down in a most brazen and despicable manner. His allegations lack merit, reasoning, and logic. As a devil\u2019s masquerade, Akintola hides under the cover of MURIC to incite Yoruba Muslims against Yoruba Christians, thereby fomenting religious tension that could trigger religious terrorism.\n\nAs a jihadist, Akintola spews hatred and paints non-Muslim Yorubas as Muslim haters. As an advocate of Sharia law, Akintola dresses bigotry as a theology. A dangerous time bomb that could go off any time. As a religious bigot, Akintola is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to fanatical Islamic opinions and prejudices. He treats Yoruba Christians with hatred and intolerance. Yorubas must reject his intolerance, his fascist tactics, his Maoist brainwashing, his continuous violations of ordinary common sense, his evident desire to destroy Yoruba unity, and his lack of simple human decency. Unity of Yorubas is our best weapon against the army of bigotry under the tutelage of Akintola.\n\nAs for Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo, the kamikaze king, his utterances and actions smark of desecration of Yoruba kingship traditions, rites, and observances. He behaves like a political thug. Before he became king he was fully aware of the role of a Yoruba king as the chief priest of Yoruba deities. He knew he\u2019s opposed to the deities and would not perform such rites, why did he agree to ascend the throne? What was he thinking about? Enough of his tomfoolery. He\u2019s lucky he still remains on the throne. By now he should be languishing in exile. Iwo people in particular and Yorubas in general, must fight and reject Oluwo\u2019s disrespectful acts and violence against Yoruba symbols, deities, traditions, faith, and the jealously guarded shrines in Yoruba palaces.\n\n[email protected]",

          "title": "Nigeria's technology ecosystem and its lower-class population",
          "text": "This article was submitted to TechCabal by Dare Tunmise. Dare Tunmise is a writer interested in both poetry and technology.\n\nIt had been three days since the lights went out on the off campus streets of the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA). Exams were approaching, and students trooped out of their lodgings to find public places\u2014barbing salons, electronics and grocery stores, eateries\u2014to charge their phones and laptops. In a corner, at one such place, John*, a 100 level student of computer engineering, sat by a plugged Android phone, shuffling between two apps, a code editor and a browser; and in his lap sat a book titled, Introduction to Algorithms.\n\nJohn had recently met a group of tech enthusiasts like himself on Nairaland where they had been lucky to be mentored by an experienced developer who kept them updated with assignments attached to strict deadlines. This explains why, after a three-day power cut on campus, with a dead phone and an important task that would judge his progress, John left the comfort of his hostel to sit in a noisy shop filled with noise and mosquitoes to complete his coding tasks. But John\u2019s story is just one of many accounts of the grit and passion of Nigerian youths from the lower class, who are determined to break into tech.\n\nThe rise in technology advocacy and youth unemployment\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the number of young people beating a path to the doors of Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem. Many factors are responsible for this. With social media bringing diverse people together and creating a sort of boundary collapse, there has been a rapid rise in tech advocacy among young people including those with no technological background. Another factor to consider is the high unemployment rate in the country. In a report on its website, the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics recorded the youth unemployment rate at 42.5% in the last quarter of 2020. These, in addition to individual interest, are two of many factors driving a lot of people into learning digital skills\u2014programming especially\u2014in order to explore its many possibilities.\n\nBut learning computer programming\u2014even with the availability of free online resources, YouTube tutorials and mentorship from developer communities online\u2014does not make coding an easy subject for most beginners whose computer knowledge is limited to MS Word and Mavis Beacon; many quit the course after only a few weeks of learning.\n\nFor Nigerian tech newbies, the reasons for quitting are not far-fetched. With no bootcamps, healthy tools, power outage which is sure to last for days, enabling environments and with little resources for internet connections, constraints soon become glaring to our aspiring developer. This is the situation with Bolaji, an economics undergraduate at the University of ibadan, who after every school day tiredly sit in the dorm room he shares with six others, waiting for power supply, a cheap internet connection that is active only on a midnight plan, of which as he opens the tutorial on the youtube channel, even with his heavy use of coffee or redbull, he soon doze off, dreaming of assignments and school works, a pattern that soon becomes repetitive, engulfing him to finally postpone his 100 days of code.\n\nInstances are not scarce since the struggle is common and understandable, and the harsh pattern of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps has been found peculiar to many of such people who went from zero tech knowledge to gaining a skill set that allowed them to build amazing products or work for corporate bodies. Speaking about his experience, Kay*, who works as an engineer for a tech startup in Nigeria, recalled how, six years ago, he had struggled with the lack of personal tools, internet connection, and epilectic power supply, and how these factors had stalled his learning, and almost sent him into depression. He recalled too how he\u2019d secretly downloaded a code editor on his mother\u2019s laptop to learn coding while she was in bed.\n\nBut it is not a triumph everywhere, at least not for the many indigent tech enthusiasts who await the miracle of laptops acquired from giveaways, or others who started out learning coding on their mobile smartphones, but quit due to the technical limitations of phones.\n\nIn a now pinned tweet he made on July 7, Thomas Burkhart, founder of DevsHelsDevs, a charity organisation founded out of the need to help indigent Africans interested in coding with laptops and other requirements, wrote about how handling the streams of requests he receives through his direct messages have been heavy on his mental health and how he needs to pause a bit on the donations. Looking through the organisation\u2019s website where donations and requests are tracked, with a budget deficit and an endless number of requests, one is left to wonder about the number of developers whose learning would be stalled and who would have no choice but to look into something else outside of coding.\n\nThe absence of infrastructure and resources in Nigeria\u2019s technology ecosystem\n\nProgramming is highly demanding work. It requires finance, time, passion and dedication. For Nigerian tech enthusiasts, however, the problem is not passion; it is not the absence of grit or hunger. The problem is the absence of the materials\u2014in communities where power supply is a rare gift; where internet connection is a luxury; where these dreamers are not afforded the opportunity to sit all day with laptops because, who would provide your daily bread? These dreamers live in a less industrialised state where government apathy towards youth empowerment is glaring; where policies are designed to stifle dreams; where, for many, the goal of being a software engineer will eventually become a dream too far to reach.\n\nEveryday, there is a spread of technological awareness among young people, with many considering a career in tech, and while the journey might be an easy ride for those that are privileged and have all the resources needed at their reach, especially in industrialised nations where existing structures make the industry accessible for all sorts of people, for the Nigerian lower class, breaking into tech is an experience fraught with travail and all sort of bootstrapping\u2014an exodus that has witnessed many potential techstars quit out of frustration and the psychological discouragement of not meeting a world class status, while a few earned their stripes by walking like a camel through the eye of a needle.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Is Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha a win for global creators?",
          "text": "Launched in 2019 by Cregital, a Lagos-based creative design agency, Disha Pages gave users the tools with which to build their own one-page websites from the comfort of their smartphones, without worrying about technicalities such as coding or sorting out a domain name.\n\nCredit: Disha (Medium)\n\nThe product was an instant hit and got considerable adoption among creators and gig workers. Unfortunately, by a little over a year after its launch\u2014at the peak of the pandemic\u2014the company announced that they were shutting down the product.\n\n\u201cHow can we help?\u201d\n\nAs soon as the announcement of the shutdown went up, the Disha team were inundated with calls and messages from baffled well wishers, all of them concerned and wondering what they could do to keep the platform alive. These early conversations were tepid, nothing was concrete\u2014until Flutterwave came into the picture offering a total buyout. The move by the payments giant, which earlier this year became a unicorn, is surprising as both companies operate in different spaces\u2014Flutterwave in payments and Disha in the creator industry. One wonders, then, what the play is here.\n\nIn a call with Flutterwave\u2019s head of product marketing, Onyedikachim Nwankwo, explained that while both companies may run different businesses, their company goals are aligned. \u201cFlutterwave is about creating endless possibilities for everyone, and Disha\u2019s goal of enabling creators achieve success and get paid for their work ties into Flutterwave\u2019s larger mission of helping small businesses thrive.\u201d\n\nNew look for Disha?\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Flutterwave says that the buyout will grow Disha\u2019s base by providing users with the ability to make, receive and withdraw money from their Disha accounts in over 150 currencies and 34 countries across the world. Despite the acquisition, however, Disha will remain an independent company. According to Nwankwo, \u201cIts original vision will be maintained.\u201d\n\nRufus Oyemade, Software and Architectural Lead at Flutterwave, states that Disha coming under the Flutterwave family means its vision will be explored farther than earlier imagined. \u201cBefore now, when users created a Disha page and linked to a Flutterwave payment link, they got taken off the Disha site. Now, with the acquisition, users can create and accept their payments, all in one place.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave has always played in the creator space, having supported arts events like ArtX Lagos. Now, as the digital world opens up to creators getting paid for their work through innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the payments giant is well positioned to help creators on Disha access global markets and further grow the global creator economy, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion.\n\nFlutterwave became a unicorn in March after reaching a $1 billion valuation, and the company may be set to triple that value in the future to the tune of $3 billion by acquiring more funding.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current surge in the price of cryptocurrencies (bull run) is perhaps one of the most exciting in the crypto market in recent times. Things started with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) recording incredible numbers in the first quarter of 2021, with as much as $10 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter.\n\nNews of all-time highs floods the media, with some people doubling or even 23x their earnings, making mind-boggling amounts of money in a short amount of time.\n\nIn addition to unbelievable earnings, the rise of meme coins is another unique thing about this current bull run.\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t the first time meme coins are popping up, but it\u2019s safe to say that this is the first time we\u2019re seeing them in this magnitude. In fact, the first African themed meme coin, Wakanda Inu, has just been launched. But what are these meme coins, and are they worth the hype?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are meme coins?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Old Money on Unsplash\n\nMeme coins are related to memes, those funny videos, pictures, or texts that reference a particular social or cultural phenomenon. The trending \u201cI wan dey do now\u201d is an excellent example.\n\nIn simple terms, meme coins are crypto tokens inspired by social media trends, jokes, or movies.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are over 250 meme coins, including Dodgelon Mars, Safemoon Inu, SHIBA INU, SHIBAVAX, Loser Coin, Rotten, and DogeZilla.\n\nFrom their names, it\u2019s possible to tell what some meme coins stand for.\n\nAlthough there are hundreds of meme coins, those referred to as OG (original gangster) meme coins are the most popular with the highest market capitalisation.\n\nThe biggest OG is Dogecoin, the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation of $35.6 billion.\n\nSHIBA INU, which has been touted as the Dogecoin killer, is the second biggest with a market capitalisation of $28.29 billion, sitting two places below Dogecoin.\n\nInterestingly there\u2019s now an African-themed meme coin \u2014 Wakanda Inu \u2014 made to create wealth for Africans. Currently ranked 2818 with a market cap of $26.8 million, Wakanda Inu is far from being an OG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Clay Banks on Unsplash\n\nHowever, supporters of the token are bullish about its growth, despite its ranking, with many claiming to have made a lot of money from the token.\n\nWhile meme tokens might be a product of social media trends with no fundamental use case backing them, they have recorded enormous growth and made their hodlers a lot of money.\n\nSide note: Hodl is a crypto term derived from misspelling \u2018hold\u2019; it also means \u2018holding on for dear life\u2019. It is a strategy where a coin is held for the long term for higher gains.\n\nHowever, investing in them still poses risks.\n\nMeme coins might make you a lot of money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Crystal Mapes on Unsplash\n\nSome people, like Glauber Contessoto, aka Slumdoge Millionaire, who became a millionaire with Dogecoin, have publicly revealed how much they\u2019ve made from meme coins.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, he invested $250,000 in Dogecoins when a unit was worth $0.045 (4.5 cents). He became a millionaire two months later, on April 15, 2021. Contessoto told CBNC that he invested because of the strong community behind Dogecoin and Elon Musk\u2019s backing of the coin.\n\nThe Doge Millionaire believes that the coin will build him generational wealth.\n\nHowever, he lost his millionaire status after the value of Dogecoin decreased. Nevertheless, Contessoto remains bullish about the meme coin, refusing to sell and even more.\n\nDogecoin isn\u2019t the only meme coin making people millionaires. SHIBA INU also has its millionaires.\n\nAccording to Fortune, a man identified simply as Rob made an $8,000 bet on SHIBA INU and immediately retired after earning a million dollars on his bet.\n\nCNN also told the story of two brothers \u2014 Tommy and James \u2014 who invested in the Dogecoin killer and made a killing from it. The brothers also convinced other family members to invest in the coin. Before long, the family\u2019s $7,900 investment was worth almost $9 million.\n\nIn October, SHIBA INU was able to unseat Dogecoin as the biggest OG in the meme coin universe, gaining nearly 900,000,000% since it was created in August 2020.\n\nWhile meme coins have made people overnight millionaires, that is not always the case.\n\nYou can lose a lot of money with meme coins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nairametrics\n\nThe release of the Korean hit series Squid Game, in September, was the beginning of another massive Internet trend. The series became Netflix\u2019s biggest hit show, with over 130 million watches globally in October.\n\nThe record-breaking series made headlines, inspiring a lot of viral content in the process.\n\nThe series also spurred a meme token \u2014 the SQUID Token \u2014 that took advantage of all the noise the hit series created.\n\nThe timing was perfect, and the coin took off because Squid Game was perhaps the most popular thing on the Internet at the time\n\nAccording to the coin\u2019s whitepaper, it was built just like the series. It contained several games to be played by coin hodlers; however, instead of playing for their lives, hodlers played to earn coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series: Sqid Game. Source: BBC\n\nThe rise of the SQUID token was meteoric; it got a lot of attention and made headlines, increasing its popularity and the rally behind it.\n\nAn October 28, 2021, CNBC headline read, There\u2019s a \u2018Squid Game\u2019 cryptocurrency \u2013 and it\u2019s up nearly 2,400% in the last 24 hours.\n\nIt was a juicy coin and everyone wanted in on the action until the creators switched from green lights to red and decided it was time to cash out.\n\nAccording to WIRED, the media failed to point out that there were no ties between the Squid Game Netflix series and the coin.\n\nThe coin went from less than a dollar to $600 per coin, and many hodlers saw themselves as theoretical millionaires. The reality, however, was that they just partook in a huge two-week-long scam.\n\nThe hodlers of the coin couldn\u2019t sell it, which meant they had no way to liquidate their earnings if the price of the token fell. Although the red flags were all too evident, it was already too late to do anything.\n\nThe creators dumped their hodlings, bringing the token, which reached a value of about $2,860 per token in less than two weeks, to almost zero.\n\nPerpetrators of the \u2018rug pull\u2019 scam were estimated to have made away with at least $3.9 million, according to BscScan.\n\nAlthough scams like this paint meme coins in a bad light, the continued existence of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU signals that they might not all be out to get you broke, but how can you tell?\n\nNew meme coins are constantly being created, and it\u2019s getting increasingly hard to differentiate what\u2019s real from what\u2019s not. For example, the new African-themed meme token \u2014 Wakanda Inu \u2014 named after a fictional African city \u2014 Wakanda \u2014 in the movie the Black Panther is on the rise and rallying strongly.\n\nAlthough the token has the backing of popular Nigerian crypto trader and tutor, Chris Ani, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, and even well-meaning meme coins might not fly.\n\nThe African meme token \u2014 Wakanda Inu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWakanda Inu home page\n\nAccording to the token\u2019s whitepaper, \u201cWakanda Inu is a community meme project forged from the deep and warm consciousness of humanity.\u201d\n\nIt says it is \u201ca decentralized meme token to drive growth in the industry, decentralized finance-oriented activities across the world.\n\nBe a pioneer on this mission. Wakanda Inu will outperform every meme coin out there. We are well on our way to inevitable widespread adoption.\u201d\n\nThe whitepaper also reveals that the token will drive charity oriented activities across the world.\n\nAs a community-driven token, the public will decide what happens with the token and which projects to embark upon.\n\nIt is simply a token created to enrich Africans through their collective efforts.\n\nWhile Wakanda Inu means well for Africans, one of the most crucial points to look out for in a token is utility which it doesn\u2019t seem to have yet.\n\nAccording to Mint, experts believe that rather than communities, a token should be backed by fundamentals, also known as utilities or use cases.\n\nFor example, many protocols have been built on the Ethereum network because it has the technology to help NFTs and DeFi, among others, work.\n\nMeme tokens, on the other hand, exist because of a trend and grow in value as long as more people buy and hodl it.\n\nSidharth Sogani, Founder and CEO of Crebaco Global, a crypto and blockchain-focused research, rating, and intelligence company, says meme coins \u201care just community tokens. These are pump and dump coins, which don\u2019t have any use cases.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dogecoin, which started as a meme coin, is working on a use case.\n\nAccording to Market Insider, the American movie theatre could start accepting Dogecoin as a form of payment.\n\nThe SHIBA INU whitepaper has also shown that the token\u2019s ecosystem will contain ShibaSwap, a DeFi platform that will facilitate crypto trading.\n\nWakanda Inu\u2019s whitepaper states that a DeFi platform or NFT farming staking platform could be in the works depending on what the community chooses to build.\n\nHowever, the token is still entirely dependent on the community to grow any form of value.\n\nIn addition to use cases, a YouTuber, Mentoraa\u2019s World, pointed out other red flags within the Wakanda Inu infrastructure.\n\nHe discovered an address that held 8.6775% of the Wakanda Inu token. According to the YouTuber, no wallet address is supposed to be holding up to 4% of a particular token. If the address decides to dump the token, it could adversely affect its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWallets holding Wakanda Inu on BscScan\n\nHe analysed the token with Token Sniffer, a website that analyses the risk level of a token, and it was ranked highly risky.\n\nThere were also anomalies within the token\u2019s source code that could allow the transfer of the tokens to be halted. This means hodlers might not be able to transfer the token.\n\nHowever, the analysis by the website is experimental and isn\u2019t 100% accurate.\n\nIt is important to note that crypto tokens have become increasingly easy to make, increasing the probability of encountering scam tokens.\n\nTherefore, adequate research is necessary before investing in crypto, especially meme coins.\n\nAs the rally behind Wakanda Inu grows, time is perhaps the only factor that can reveal where it is headed.\n\nDisclaimer: The contents of this article are not financial advice.

          "title": "Global startup, Healthlane, launches its world-class preventive healthcare facilities in Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Africa has been plagued with tough health challenges. With its healthcare system poorly developed, the life expectancy rate in the continent currently lies at 63 years for males and 66 years for females. Much lower than the global average of 71 for males and 73 for females.\n\nTo help tackle a part of this problem, Alain Nteff launched Giftedmom in 2012 and he pivoted the company in 2019 to become Healthlane. The startup now offers a wide range of services to Africans.\n\nIn September 2020, the company raised $2.4 million to expand its offerings, stating that it had some interesting moves in the works.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 9, 2021, Healthlane, announced its official launch in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorthy of note is the fact that the life expectancy in Nigeria is lower than the continental average with 59 to 63 years for males and females respectively, but that might soon be changing.\n\nAt an event hosted at the immaculate Healthlane office in Lekki, Lagos Nigeria, Alain Nteff, alongside key Healthlane executives and notable clients shared Healthlane\u2019s vision to use technology to improve healthcare in Nigeria and the benefits of the Healthlane experience.\n\nTo kickstart the event, Folu Olumideko, Head, Marketing and Communications gave a welcome speech highlighting the company\u2019s mission to simplify how people track and optimise their health.\n\nTaking up the baton, Healthlane founder and Managing Director, Alain Nteff thanked the team and the clients for the successful launch of the Healthlane app and its world-class healthcare technology to help people live longer and healthy lives.\n\n\u201cI remember in 2019 I knew preventive care was important, but I had no feasibility. No idea about the pricing, and sometimes when you meet the doctor, he asks you what symptoms you\u2019re having so he can prescribe a test. Comprehensive checkup was not really a thing at that time,\u201d he says.\n\nAlain also pointed out that most of those heavily affected by COVID-19 were those with pre-existing health conditions.\n\n\u201cBefore 2020, my mom fell sick regularly, and the hospital kept treating typhoid and malaria. I now realised that I had to take her for comprehensive checkups. In 2020, she was one of those that we lost from conditions that could have been prevented. And that was the turning point for us, and we said we need to make preventive care something big in the coming years.\u201d\n\nHe also states that before Healthlane, what we usually call healthcare is actually \u201csick care\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re sick, you go to the doctor, give them your symptoms, and they give you prescriptions. That\u2019s what sick care is,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cToday at Healthlane, we believe healthcare is about eating well, exercising, supplementing, having checkups, and immunising yourself. If we get this right, then we should be helping everyone live like 20 \u2013 30 years extra and not lose loved ones to preventable illnesses,\u201d he added.\n\nAlain announced that Healthlane has consulted with top health experts across the globe on what would be the right healthcare practices to help people live longer, and he excitedly revealed that the company has been able to execute this with the aid of technology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve birthed a world-class lab on-site, and it reports that it has conducted over 70 tests. Apart from doing just tests, we also help identify ways to optimise what has been found or reverse a condition that has been found. We are also launching the Healthlane app which keeps records and implements healthcare plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, people are now comfortable accessing their medical records on their smartphones. They are more concerned about preventing themselves so they don\u2019t fall prey to certain diseases. We all know that if you are diabetic or hypertensive, you are more affected if you contract Covid-19 compared to someone who is relatively healthy. There is a growing trend of services being deployed through technology and that is where we have positioned ourselves,\u201d Nteff asserts.\n\nBuilding affordable healthcare\n\nBuilding on Alain\u2019s introduction, Dr Lincoln Saiki, one of Healthlane\u2019s in-house physicians, presented a live case study of an individual who looks seemingly healthy to the average observer but had hidden symptoms that could only be revealed through a comprehensive checkup like Healthlane\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAs of today, 1 in 17 Nigerians have diabetes, 1 in five Nigerians suffer from obesity, and 1 in 3 Nigerians have high blood pressure and hypertension. You might be wondering how it\u2019s possible to have 75 million Nigerians with hypertension, but it is one of the silent killers. People might have it for years without symptoms and only when it manifests in the form of strokes, heart attack, heart failure, or kidney failure. To date, it remains the largest cause of preventable deaths.\u201d Lincoln revealed.\n\nThe doctor explained that Healthlane provides up to 78 different tests, and the results are normally out in 45 minutes. The company also helps to create a feeding, supplement or exercising plan from the result of the test.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s a body analysis which shows parameters like age, weight, height, body fat among others.\n\nThis follows the Baseline checks which involves Heart Health, Diabetes check, Immunity, Kidney Health, Liver Health, Blood, Cancer check, Hormones, Bones and Minerals.\n\nFinally, the company creates a care plan using the insights from the test.\n\nHealthlane\u2019s product manager, Karen Onigbinde, explained that the Healthlane app, which is available on the Google and Apple app stores, makes it easy for people to make the lifestyle changes that are required for them to live long and healthy.\n\n\u201cWe have features that let you access your wellness checks, so you can schedule and pay for your wellness appointments, your vaccinations, and your supplements from the Google app. You can also track your health data, and also download them in case you want to consult a second opinion. You also manage your health with a care plan which contains those reminders that tell you to drink water, eat well, and exercise\u201d she detailed.\n\nKaren also revealed that Healthlane would be building a lot more features that will help people access healthier food or make it easier to get on the healthlane.\n\nTestimonials\n\nMost tellingly, one of Healthlane\u2019s clients, Buchi, a fitness expert who loved to keep fit and take care of his health decided to do a comprehensive check with Healthlane, and found out he had deficiencies he didn\u2019t know about. The company then went on to create a distinct healthcare plan to suit his needs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say I work hard, I\u2019m fit, I don\u2019t have any medical issues, but you never know what\u2019s going on inside of you. I found that my Vitamin D was low, but I\u2019ve had an amazing experience with Healthlane to help adjust this issue.\n\nAnother client, Nadayar Enegesi, CEO of Eden Life also praised the Healthlane experience, pointing out that he had always been wary of hospitals and had never tried to do any check ups even when recommended.\n\n\u201cI was just amazed at the experience. There were about 78 tests that were run, and I really appreciated the detail that the solution went to educate me about what is going on in my body. We worked through the care plan and I got some supplements. I was also advised to change my diet to include more fruits and nuts,\u201d he briefly recounted.\n\nAre the services affordable?\n\nThe company offers a wide range of affordable wellness products for individuals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve signed up health insurance services providers like Hygeia HMO and Reliance HMO and anyone covered by them can access our healthcare services,\u201d said Damola Ajayi, Healthlane\u2019s head of Sales and Business Development.\n\nShe then revealed that there are three affordable pricing packages available.\n\nThere\u2019s the:\n\nWorld-class check where you do as much as 95 tests for just \u20a6135,000 ($325)\n\nExecutive check which is just \u20a649,000 ($149) for 69 checks\n\nPremium package which is just \u20a628,000 ($68) for 43 checks.\n\nThere are also corporate and HMO plans.\n\nShe also explained that Healthlane offers mobile labs for companies who want to test their employees at their offices.\n\nAddressing Techpoint Africa\u2019s inquiry at the Press Q&A session, Alain explained that Healthlane\u2019s services are already gaining traction with a good number of working professionals in Lagos, Nigeria, and he expects the company to gradually expand to other locations in the near future.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "e-Naira drawing interest from outside world \u2013 IMF",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday said the launch of e-Naira by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is drawing substantial interest from the outside world, including from central banks.\n\nThe CBN officially launched the \u201c eNaira\u201d \u2013 a central bank digital currency (CBDC) \u2013 on October 25, 2021. This is the second CBDC fully open to the public after the Bahamas.\n\nIn the latest report titled, \u2018Five Observations on Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency,\u2019 by Jack Ree, IMF African Department, the Fund explained that like coins or cash, the eNaira is a liability of the CBN.\n\nThe eNaira uses the same blockchain technology as Bitcoin or Ethereum and, like them, the eNaira is stored in digital wallets and can be used for payment transactions; and it can be transferred digitally and at virtually no cost to anyone in the world with an eNaira wallet. There are, however, important differences. First, the eNaira features stringent access right controls by the central bank.\n\nSecond, unlike these crypto-assets, the eNaira is not a financial asset in itself but a digital form of a national currency and draws its value from the physical naira, to which it is pegged at parity.\n\nWhy did Nigeria introduce eNaira?\n\nAccording to the CBN, the eNaira is envisaged to bring multiple benefits, which are expected to materialize gradually as the eNaira becomes more widespread and is supported by a robust regulatory system. Key benefits include the following:\n\nIncrease in financial inclusion. For now, the eNaira wallet is provided only to people with bank accounts, but its coverage is expected to eventually expand to anyone with a mobile phone even if they do not have a bank account. A large number of people do not have bank accounts (38 million people; 36 percent of the adult population), and allowing those of them with a mobile phone to have access to the eNaira would increase financial inclusion and facilitate more direct and effective implementation of social transfers programs. It is expected that the move would enable up to 90 percent of the population to use the eNaira.\n\nRead Also: CBN warns of fake e-Naira platform\n\ne-Naira\n\nFacilitation of remittances. Nigeria is among the key remittance destinations in sub-Saharan Africa, with remittance receipts amounting to $24 billion in 2019. Remittances typically are made through international money transfer operators (e.g., Western Union) with fees ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent of the value of the transaction. The eNaira is expected to lower remittance transfer costs, making it easier for the Nigerian diaspora to remit funds to Nigeria by obtaining eNaira from international money transfer operators and transferring them to recipients in Nigeria by wallet-to-wallet transfers free of charge. Exchange rate reforms, including a unified market-clearing rate, that reduce the gap between official and parallel market exchange rates would enhance the incentives for using eNaira wallets to send remittances.\n\nReduced informality. Nigeria has a large informal economy, with transactions and employment equivalent, respectively, to over half of GDP and 80 percent of employment. The eNaira is account-based, and transactions are in principle fully traceable, unlike token-based crypto asset transactions. Once the eNaira becomes more widespread and embedded into the economy, it may bring greater transparency to informal payments and strengthen the tax base. Informal and formal businesses may also benefit if eNaira adoption enhances consumption through greater financial inclusion.\n\nWhat are the potential risks?\n\nLike digital currencies elsewhere, the eNaira carries risks for monetary policy implementation, cyber security, operational resilience, and financial integrity and stability. For example, eNaira wallets may be perceived, or even effectively function, as a deposit at the central bank, which may reduce demand for deposits in commercial banks. Relying as it does on digital technology, there is a need to manage cybersecurity and operational risks associated with the eNaira.\n\nWhat are the authorities doing to mitigate the potential risks?\n\nThe authorities have taken measures to manage the risks. The transfer of funds from bank deposits to eNaira wallets is subject to daily transactions and balance limits to mitigate risks of diminishing the roles of banks and other financial institutions. Financial integrity risks, such as those arising from the potential use of the eNaira for monetary laundering, are mitigated by using a tiered identity verification system and applying more stringent controls to relatively less verified users. For example, for now only people with a bank verification number can open a wallet, but over time coverage will be expanded to people with registered SIM cards and to those with mobile phones but no ID numbers. The latter categories of holders would be subject to tighter transactions and balance limits. Even so, wallet holders who meet the highest identity verification standards cannot hold more than 5 million naira (about $12,200) each in their eNaira wallets. To address cybersecurity risk, regular IT security assessments are expected to be conducted.\n\nWhat can the IMF do?\n\nThe IMF remains available to help with technical assistance and policy advice. The IMF\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets Department has been involved in the eNaira rollout process, including by providing reviews of the product design. The 2021 IMF Article IV mission emphasized the need for monitoring risks and macro-financial impacts associated with a central bank digital currency. The IMF is ready to collaborate with the authorities on data analysis, cross-country studies, sharing the eNaira experience with other countries, and discussing further evolution of the eNaira including its design, regulatory framework, and other aspects.",

          "text": "Zainab Ahmed, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning has said that the economic development plans of the Federal Government are sustainable and would remain relevant in the near future, adding that they seek to strengthen the diversification of the economy which is every administration\u2019s goal.\n\nAhmed noted this during a Channels Television interview where she talked about the plans of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and the impact it would have on Nigerians, even after the present government leaves office.\n\nAccording to her, the plans of the Federal Government are sustainable and would remain relevant in the near future because they seek to strengthen the diversification of the economy which is every administration\u2019s goal.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government seeks to provide a strong foundation for a concentric diversified economy thereby deepening the diversification,\u201d the minister said during the interview.\n\nThe broad objective of the plan, according to her, includes building the country\u2019s critical major infrastructures like; roads, water, power and social development infrastructures such as schools and hospitals.\n\n\u201cThey also have a plan to build a solid framework that is designed to enhance the capacities of the country\u2019s security agencies and also ensure good governance, transparency, and accountability,\u201d Ahmed explained.\n\nShe also stated that they provided in the plan, the process to have a vibrant education and a health sector to support the human capital development of the citizens. So those are the major broad objectives of the plan.\n\nRead also: AfCFTA: Five commodities Nigeria can leverage to boost export\n\nOn increasing agric export, the minister stated that Nigeria has the opportunity to export as much agricultural product as possible within Africa because of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA) that opens up the continent as a whole single market. Being the biggest market in Africa, the minister said Nigeria intends to take advantage of the AFCFTA.\n\nShe also stated that Nigeria would be known for the export of agricultural produce. She explained that the government intends to concentrate on improving agricultural production to improve productivity, to not only feed but also create jobs to create wealth in terms of small-medium enterprises.\n\nThat, according to her, is beyond subsistence agriculture and is important because Nigeria needs to move to agro-business, strengthen the market end of the agricultural values, and have commodity markets so that the goods produced are treatable based on international standards.\n\nAlso speaking, the minister said the Federal Government has made plans to reprivatize the assets in Ajaokuta that were previously franchised to some parties.\n\nShe stated that some very significant advances have been made in terms of negotiations with the parties that the asset was previously franchised to and cancelled at the wrong time.\n\nShe further explained that there has been an international negotiation that has been completed. \u201cThe settlement of those negotiations is being discussed, so they can pay them off so that the Federal Government can get back the asset and either re-privatize it or find the best way to put it to use.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview with Channels TV, the minister said smuggling is responsible for the rising cost of rice in the country. To solve this issue, she said there \u201cthere\u2019s a joint patrol team that is working with the Nigerian customs police which includes the DSS, alongside several of the security agencies to tackle the issue.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the Government is subsidizing, encouraging, supporting the production of fertilizer, working towards bringing and researching institutions that develop quality input, to be able to reduce the high cost of production which leads to the increase in the prices of the locally produced rice.\n\nShe said the Federal Government is looking to provide some palliative for a large number of the population in terms of transport subsidy for a short period like six months or nine months or a maximum of 12 months, the minister of finance said. This plan, according to her is to help reduce the effect of the removal of fuel subsidy on Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThey plan that the transport subsidy will be given directly to individuals, however, the constraint for them is the issue of registration; the national identity registration process is ongoing and they want to make sure that this subsidy goes into the hands of the right people,\u201d she said, adding that the government want to be able to make transfers to people using their BVNs, account number, and national identity number. The subsidy removal should commence from July, the earliest by the beginning of the year.\n\nOn rail connection, Ahmed noted that the President has a directive to link the whole country with rail lines at least within triangular access using the funds borrowed by the Government.\n\nAccording to her, it will include the Lagos-Ibadan-Kano rail that is ongoing, the Port-Harcourt to Maiduguri which cuts across about six or eight states, and the coaster rail from Port-Harcourt to Lagos.\n\nThe Government also intends to use these funds borrowed to work on major roads. These roads include the Abuja, Kaduna, Kano road, the second Niger bridge, the east-west road, the Lagos-Ibadan Road and other major roads in each state which are being worked on, handled by the Federal Ministry of works, she said.\n\nThe loans, according to the minister, would also be used for power projects for the deployment of transmission lines to link up to expand the national grid, loans for major dam and water irrigation projects that are also necessary for the advancement of agricultural production.\n\nThe minister of finance stated that the sale of Nigeria\u2019s national assets is not just to raise revenue but to turn them into performing assets.\n\nShe made it known that some national assets are already being sold but the major reason is largely to transform those investments into performing assets.\n\nAccording to her, there was no point in having an asset invested in, which is not performing. Ahmed said she believes it is \u201cbetter to sell the asset to a private sector company that can run the business better, which in turn makes the economy better.\u201d",

          "title": "MallforAfrica closure mirrors hurdle facing eCommerce in Nigeria",
          "text": "MallforAfrica, a Nigerian-owned platform that enables Nigerians to shop globally, recently shut down its business, bringing to spotlight the many challenges impeding the growth of eCommerce in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nTheir exit comes on the heels of eCommerce sales projected to grow to $7 trillion across the globe by 2024, Visa Consulting and Analytics report shows. According to Euromonitor, the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies by 2030 will be in Africa. This consequently makes the continent the next big e-commerce market.\n\nAlthough MallforAfrica cited Nigeria\u2019s unstable foreign exchange market as a major challenge, there are other growth obstructions not letting operators thrive in the market.\n\nTope Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s founder said the idea for MallforAfrica was conceived \u200efrom a personal need and that the application is only a middle man in the transaction of business between the buyer in Nigeria and the various sites in the U.S. or U.K.\n\n\u201cI tried to shop on various U.S. and U.K. websites and couldn\u2019t. So between me and my brother, Chris Folayan, we developed this app which now solves that problem. You can shop on Amazon, Marks and Spencer and a whole lot of UK and US sites which would normally not sell online to Nigerians,\u201d Folayan said.\n\nRead Also: Jobberman to develop Nigeria\u2019s e-commerce sector through behavioural profiling\n\nCompanies such as OLX, Gloo, Efritin.com, among others have been forced to take the exit option for different reasons. Jumia has also tinkered with its strategy, selling off business verticals to survive, while Konga was sold to Zinox.\n\nThe eCommerce market in Nigeria is faced with many challenges. The cost of international logistics and the chain of distribution cancelled orders for on-demand services, and subsequently, loss of revenue are contributing factors to the closure of eCommerce companies. The World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) 2020 ranked the nation 110 out of 160 countries.\n\nThe growth of e-commerce will significantly depend on the quality and efficiency of logistics networks from intra- and cross-trade to financial transactions in payment of goods and services.\n\nAnd as this positive narrative continues to place Africa as a top investment destination, the need for advanced logistics systems has become inevitable.\n\nFrom delayed deliveries between local destinations to sluggish growth of cross-border trade, the effects are being felt across the board.\n\nBut experts say there is strong potential for payments providers to partner with growing pan-regional players to support this growth.\n\nGideon Ayogu, Head, Corporate Communications, Konga/Zinox Group said, \u201cThe major challenge faced by Konga in the e-Commerce space is that of logistics, especially considering the decrepit transport infrastructure in Nigeria, and this challenge under the current management is being surmounted with the equipping of Kxpress\u201d.\n\nKxpress is an internally owned logistics subsidiary which leverages on the proliferation of Konga physical stores across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAt the last count, Kxpress can call on over 400 delivery assets, including vans, trucks, cars, buses and motorcycles, while Konga also uses its stores closest to the customer as pick-up points or for last mile deliveries,\u201d Ayogu said.\n\nAnother challenge cited is the issue of publicity from dissatisfied customers on social media, notably with the rise of social media marketplace. Konga is solving this by paying close attention to product quality. There is a zero tolerance for fake or substandard products to the merchants on its marketplace.\n\nModern online retailing is headed towards pre-orders, requiring mature infrastructure for both small and medium businesses. This will help meet the packaging, storage, distribution, freight and last-mile-delivery requirements.\n\nAlso, with the rise of social media marketplace, for example Instagram, eCommerce merchants have had to struggle with capturing the attention of their customers who range from middle-class and upper-class Nigerians.\n\nHowever, the impact of the economy on these citizens has by far affected the choices they make between food items and luxurious collections among others, BusinessDay research shows.\n\nAccording to African Development Bank (AfDB) data, the average monthly income of a middle-class, which makes up about 23 percent of the Nigerian population is within the range of N75,000-100,000, while out of over 169 million people, only 3.3 million people are classified as upper class earning above N400,000 monthly.\n\nIn one of Nigeria\u2019s counterparts- Kenya, eCommerce transactions are mainly driven by cross-border merchants. This means that there is potential for the local eCommerce market to develop, and that there is the need to examine if sufficient acquiring infrastructure exists domestically to enable these players.\n\nThe growth of eCommerce is currently driven by both digital payments and cash-on-delivery in Kenya, showing the potential to convert more customers to digital payments through card-not-present (CNP) such as card-on-file and card present (CP) which includes softPOS or mobilePOS activities. While in Nigeria there is a greater dominance of domestic transactions driven by purchases\n\nThough challenging, Africa is a land full of commercial opportunities.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has reiterated the need to pay critical attention to the development of basic education, urging the federal government to take deliberate and urgent steps towards reducing the large number of out-of-school children in the country.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he received the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu; the management of Universal Basic Education Commission, and the Chairmen of State Universal Basic Education Boards (SUBEB), who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who expressed worry over the rising number of out-of-school children in Nigeria, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to disband Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) if it fails to return 50 percent of the children back to school.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have 50 million or so children under our care and over 10 million of them are not in school. What is our reason for existing if we have this kind of problem?\n\n\u201cSo, for me, Mr. President, if UBEC and SUBEB cannot get 50 percent of these school children back to school in the next two to three years, disband them as there is no basis for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, if we do not focus on basic education and restore quality into our basic educational system, what we are having today as banditry will be a joke in another ten to twenty years\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cFor us in Edo, we had no choice, because you find children leaving secondary schools, either working as barbers or something else. Some even sell whatever they have because someone has promised them a job in Europe or travel to Libya.\n\n\u201cAt a point in time, we had about 30 thousand young men and women from Edo in Libya, waiting to cross to Europe. If they had education and could think, read and write, they would ask more questions before deciding to embark on such a risk.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine; if we had over 30 thousand of them in Libya, how many would have died in trying to cross? The problem is that they were not properly educated.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, that was a wake-up call. For my brothers in the North East and North West, with the rising wave of banditry, I think the wakeup call is to bring these children back to school and get them to learn,\u201d he advised.\n\nEnumerating the administration\u2019s efforts at improving basic education in the state, Obaseki further noted: \u201cWhat was the Edo miracle? The first was to tell ourselves the truth that the structure of SUBEB we met was not working. So, I had to post out everybody we met and recruited fresh ones into the system. We focused on training our teachers as part of our reforms in transforming our education.\n\n\u201cWe trained our teachers on how to use technology to teach. The training was focused on the use of YouTube to make the children interested in learning; it was focused on using the tablet, which we gave them, to remove the drudgery of preparing lesson notes and monitoring attendance of the students. For them, it was practical and motivational.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, community participation is also key in transforming our schools. Infrastructure is also key, but a fine school without well-trained and equipped teachers won\u2019t impact quality education,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the minister, who was represented by Basic and Secondary Education Director, Dr. Folake Olatunji-David, said that Edo was chosen as the destination for their quarterly meeting due to its stride in using technology.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not by any coincidence that Edo is hosting this quarterly meeting, bearing in mind strides and commendable steps your state has been taking in the field of education.\n\n\u201cSo, we are here to enjoy the hospitality of the good people of Edo State.

          "title": "#EndSARS: UN, U.S., Amnesty International, others demand full implementation of Lagos panel\u2019s recommendations",
          "text": "Reactions calling for full implementation have trailed the recommendations of the Lagos State panel of enquiry which indicted the Nigerian Army and the police for killing peaceful protesters on October 20, 2020 during last year\u2019s #EndSARS protest at Lekki tollgate.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) in Nigeria, the United States government, through its embassy in Nigeria, Amnesty International, and human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, among others, made the call in separate statements on Tuesday.\n\n\u2018Implement report to build trust\u2019\n\nThe UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, Edward Kallon, welcomed the submission of the panel\u2019s report in a statement by a UN National Information Officer, Oluseyi Soremekun.\n\nHe noted that the submission of the findings of the judicial panel would accelerate the process of justice and accountability.\n\n\u201cI welcome the submission to the Lagos State Governor, H.E. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, of the reports of the judicial panel on claims of brutality and shooting in the Lekki area of Lagos State, during the 2020 EndSARS protests.\n\n\u201cI urge the government to implement the recommendations of the judicial panel of inquiry to rebuild trust and start the process of healing and reconciliation,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u2018Implement report as mechanism for accountability\u2019\n\nThe United States, through its diplomatic mission in Nigeria, said it would be looking forward to \u201cthe Lagos State government\u2019s response\u201d to the panel\u2019s report.\n\nIt said in its statement that the government\u2019s response was expected to be \u201cpart of a process that represents an important mechanism of accountability regarding the #EndSARS protests and the events that took place near the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose events led to serious allegations against some members of the security forces, and we look forward to the Lagos State and federal government taking suitable measures to address those alleged abuses as well as the grievances of the victims and their families.\u201d\n\n\u2018Buhari must act on report\u2019\n\nAlso responding to the findings of the panel, Osai Ojigho, Director, Amnesty International Nigeria, said Mr Buhari must act on the report of the panel.\n\nShe said the report confirming that the Nigerian army and police shot peaceful protesters at the Lekki tollgate on October 20, 2020, was \u201cthe truth about what happened at Lekki Tollgate.\u201d\n\nThe organisation said it contradicted \u201cthe blatant denial by the Nigerian government that deadly force was used against peaceful #EndSARS protesters.\u201d\n\nIt recalled that it had a day after the crackdown conducted its own on-the-ground investigation \u201cwhich confirmed that the Nigerian army and police killed at least 12 peaceful protesters in Lekki and Alausa \u2013 with evidence gathered from witnesses, video footage and hospital reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cA week later Amnesty International was able to release a timeline of the shootings, which confirmed that Nigerian army vehicles left a military base a short drive from the tollgate on the evening of the shootings and were present when the killings began shortly after.\u201d\n\nIt said the panel\u2019s findings \u201care only the first step towards justice and restitution,\u201d and called on President Buhari to \u201cact promptly to ensure that those found to be responsible for shooting and attacks on peaceful protesters are brought to justice in fair trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian authorities must ensure access to justice and effective remedies, including adequate compensation, restitution, and guarantee of non-repetition to victims and their families.\n\n\u201cAuthorities must also immediately and unconditionally release all #EndSARS protesters unlawfully detained since last year,\u201d Amnesty International said.\n\nFemi Falana, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, similarly called for the forwarding of the certified copy of the report of the panel to President Muhammadu Buhari given its recommendation that adequate sanctions be meted out to armed personnel involved in the torture and reckless murder of citizens.\n\n\u201cHaving received the report of the Judicial Commission the Lagos State Government is urged to accelerate the issuance of the White Paper as well as the implementation of the far reaching recommendations,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the policemen who were killed by criminal elements during the protests should be honoured notwithstanding that their family members had been compensated by the Lagos State Government.\n\nHe called on the state government to set up the Lagos State Human Rights Committee in line with the recommendation of the panel to curb unabated cases of police brutality.\n\n\u201cWhile commending the witnesses and their lawyers for exposing the official cover up of the egregious human rights abuse perpetrated by the merchants of death the Lagos State Government should designate venues where aggrieved citizens can hold rallies in exercise of their fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and expression.\n\n\u201cThe violent attack of unarmed protesters during peaceful rallies by police and military personnel should be completely outlawed since section 83 (4) of the Police Establishment Act, 2020 has imposed a duty on the police to provide adequate security for citizens who participate in peaceful meetings and rallies.\u201d\n\nAlso, a coalition of activists known as the #EndSARS frontliners have called for the prosecution of persons indicted in the report.\n\nIt also called for the compensation recommended in the report to be paid in full to all victims and their families.\n\nAlso, a former chairperson of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), Malachy Ugwummadu, added his voice to the demand for the implementation of the report.\n\nMr Ugwummadu said the failure of the Nigerian government to prosecute the culprits indicted in the report could further intensify the campaign to expose the suspected security persons including their commanders to the International Criminal Court ICC for crimes against humanity having declared the events of October 20, 2020, as a massacre.\n\nBackground\n\nThe #EndSARS panel was set up in the wake of the October 2020 #EndSARS anti-police brutality protest to probe cases of human rights violation perpetrated by the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and other police units.\n\nThe panel was also mandated to probe the shooting of peaceful protesters by soldiers and police officers on October 20, 2020 at Lekki tollgate.\n\nThe panel, led by a retired judge, Doris Okuwobi, had on Monday submitted its reports on the Lekki shooting incident and police brutality cases to the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nAfter he received the report, Mr Sanwo-Olu set up a four-member committee to look into the report within two weeks and \u201cbring forward the white paper that would be considered at the Lagos state executive council and presented as the white paper coming from the panel of inquiry.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cI welcome the submission to the Lagos State Governor, H.E.\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, of the reports of the judicial panel on claims of brutality and shooting in the Lekki area of Lagos State, during the 2020 EndSARS protests.\n\u2018Implement report as mechanism for accountability\u2019The United States, through its diplomatic mission in Nigeria, said it would be looking forward to \u201cthe Lagos State government\u2019s response\u201d to the panel\u2019s report.\n\u201cAuthorities must also immediately and unconditionally release all #EndSARS protesters unlawfully detained since last year,\u201d Amnesty International said.\nHe also said the policemen who were killed by criminal elements during the protests should be honoured notwithstanding that their family members had been compensated by the Lagos State Government.",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said there is a need for Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank to manage cyber security and operational risks associated with the eNaira.\n\nJack Ree, an economist at the IMF\u2019s African department, who made the suggestion in an article, said the eNaira is expected to increase financial inclusion and facilitate remittances, but potential risks will need to be addressed.\n\nRee in the article titled \u2018Five Observations on Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency\u2019, and released on Tuesday, wrote, \u201cLike digital currencies elsewhere, the eNaira carries risks for monetary policy implementation, cyber security, operational resilience, and financial integrity and stability.\n\n\u201cFor example, eNaira wallets may be perceived, or even effectively function, as a deposit at the central bank, which may reduce demand for deposits in commercial banks.\n\n\u201cRelying as it does on digital technology, there is a need to manage cybersecurity and operational risks associated with the eNaira.\u201d\n\nThe Bretton Woods Institution, however, said that Nigerian authorities have taken \u201cmeasures to manage the risks,\u201d noting that the transfer of funds from bank deposits to eNaira wallets is subject to daily transactions and balance limits to mitigate risks of diminishing the roles of banks and other financial institutions.\n\n\u201cFinancial integrity risks, such as those arising from the potential use of the eNaira for monetary laundering, are mitigated by using a tiered identity verification system and applying more stringent controls to relatively less verified users,\u201d the statement adds.\n\n\u201cFor example, for now only people with a bank verification number can open a wallet, but over time coverage will be expanded to people with registered SIM cards and to those with mobile phones but no ID numbers.\n\n\u201cThe latter categories of holders would be subject to tighter transactions and balance limits. Even so, wallet holders who meet the highest identity verification standards cannot hold more than 5 million naira (about $12,200) each in their eNaira wallets.\n\n\u201cTo address cybersecurity risk, regular IT security assessments are expected to be conducted.\u201d\n\nThe institution said that the launch of the eNaira has attracted a \u201csubstantial interest from the outside world\u2014including from central banks\u201d due to the \u201csize and complexity of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nAccording to it, its monetary and capital markets department was involved in the eNaira rollout process, including by providing reviews of the product design.\n\nThe IMF further assured that it remains available to help with technical assistance and policy advice.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 IMF Article IV mission emphasized the need for monitoring risks and macro-financial impacts associated with a central bank digital currency,\u201d the statement adds.\n\n\u201cThe IMF is ready to collaborate with the authorities on data analysis, cross-country studies, sharing the eNaira experience with other countries, and discussing further evolution of the eNaira including its design, regulatory framework, and other aspects.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

Fidet Okhiria, alerted all district managers and relevant officers of the need to protect railway assets in the event the strike goes ahead.\n\nThe railway workers had in a letter titled, \u201cNotice and Directive to embark on 3-day warning strike nationwide,\u201d dated November 12th, addressed to the District Chairman/Secretary Nigeria Union of Railway workers and Senior Staff Association, said they had resolved \u201cthat all the district organs (DWCs) of the NUR and SSA should, as a matter of expedience, summon a general meeting of all the workers of their districts on Monday, 15th November 2021 at exactly 10.00 a.m prompt and, in unambiguous terms, notify the entire workers of the commencement of a 3-day warning strike beginning from midnight prior to Thursday, 18th through Saturday, 20th November 2021.\u201d\n\nTo avert the strike, the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi had invited the labour unions to a meeting on Saturday but it ended in a deadlock.\n\nHowever, Okrikha said if no truce is reached, train service should be shut down with effect from Wednesday night.\n\nThe memo read, \u201cWith regards to the impending warning strike action, the management and board have met with the two in-house unions to deliberate and resolve issues that are still in discussion to avert the proposed warning strike action.\n\n\u201cHowever in the event of a strike action, you are please requested to do the following to ensure that railway assets are protected adequately.\n\n\u201cThe RDMs, managers and coordinators are to prepare and shut down train services appropriately by midnight of Wednesday, 17th November 2021.\n\nThe memo also directed the officials to move all locomotive and coaches for Abuja-Kaduna, Warri-Itakpe and Lagos-Ibadan train services to safe places.\n\nThe MD further directed that all revenue collected should be banked by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAll RDMs, managers and coordinators should ensure that the running sheds and workshop areas are property secured.

          "text": "Mr. Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), says the bank has so far distributed about $3 trillion to households, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), smallholder farmers, pharmaceutical companies to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nEmefiele who spoke in an exclusive interview with Arise TV on the sidelines of the Intra-African Trade Fair, 2021, holding in Durban, South Africa, noted that the insinuation that the CBN was overreaching its statutory bounds, was baseless, explaining that the bank had continued to play its monetary role effectively.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you this, between 2020 and now, our data shows that we have disbursed at least N2 trillion, almost N3 trillion in loans to households, to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions,\u201d he told Arise.\n\n\u201cWe have also given these funds to some of our large agricultural companies that want to get back again to business, to manufacturing companies who are accessing long term 10 years loan with two-year moratorium with single digit rate. I have data that shows we are playing our part.\u201d\n\nEmefiele who reiterated that the monetary policy and fiscal policy were working hand in hand to grow the economy, noted that with every developmental policy and initiative from the Presidency, the CBN and its fiscal counterpart, the Ministry of Finance, collaborate to achieve set goals.\n\nHe added that the new financial instrument, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d would aid President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s vision to create 10 million jobs, ThisDay reported.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you ask Finance Minister, we are always in contact and she would tell you that there are no issues about the relationship between the Monetary and Fiscal authority. So, when people say there is no synergy, again, I wonder where that is coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen COVID hit, Mr. President tasked the finance minister and I to work together to bring an immediate response and I went back to the Bankers Committee to which we came up with immediate response. And the Minister of Finance and I had opportunities several times to go back to brief the President. So it is left for you to respond whether there is collaboration between monetary and fiscal authority there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, after that, the President said that we should establish economic sustainability program (ESP) chaired by the Vice President. The central bank played an active part in the development of that program to the extent that the fiscal authorities were only meant to contribute N500 billion and monetary authorities were left to provide almost about N1.5 trillion. Please let me correct this not as grant but as loans to support people who were impacted by COVID-19 so they can get their businesses back.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cOur job is to compliment and that is why after every why at every opportunity when we hold a monetary policy committee meeting, we read out what we have done to compliment the efforts of the fiscal, and data is there.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, on what the CBN had done to cushion the economic effect of Covid-19 pandemic, he added the bank had disbursed loans close to N3 trillion to household and businesses since 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you this, in 2020 till date our data shows that we have disbursed close to at least N3 trillion in loans to households, to micro small and medium enterprises, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions. Also, to some of our larger agricultural companies that want to get back again on to business, to manufacturing companies who are now accessing long term 10-year loans with two year moratorium at single digit rate.\u201d\n\nFurther on the recent \u201c100 for 100\u201d policy, he said: \u201cAgain, the 100 for 100 is another program that came up out of the need to say that we must support more, do everything to create employment for our people. And that\u2019s why if you read the framework, we said employment, we said we must see measurable level of employment that would be provided by that projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have to be new projects and the central bank will do everything possible to provide foreign exchange to import plants and machinery. And by the time the plant or machinery are set up, import of raw material would be near zero so that we can begin look at our available local raw material, rather than importing them.\u201d",

If there are issues, of course, we address them within the ambit of the provisions.\n\n\u201cI am sure those of you in the media must have seen a report that was released through, in my view, a wrong channel, that is making the rounds in the social media.\n\n\u201cWhether it is a true report, I can\u2019t tell. But I\u2019d like to indicate that the normal procedure is to have such a report submitted to the convening authority. And then there will be a white paper that will be presented, based on which one can make informed comments.\n\n\u201cBut whatever it is currently, I\u2019d like to indicate that the Armed Forces of Nigeria is a professional armed force. We are peopled by Nigerians and we remain committed to the constitutional mandate. So we will not at this point think that Nigerians should make disparaging remarks regarding the Armed Forces of Nigeria, in the sense that we are a professional armed forces. If there are issues, of course, we address them within the ambit of the provisions.\n\n\u201cIt would not be right to disparage men and women who have worked so hard to ensure that the territorial integrity of this nation is kept intact. So in the meantime, until I see the full extent of the report.\n\n\u201cI can assure that the Armed Forces of Nigeria are well-disciplined and we do not engage in any ignoble acts. If Nigerians do not trust us, then we won\u2019t be doing what we are doing, and in any case, it is the Armed Forces of Nigeria; we are not talking of the police. So when the Armed Forces are called out, it is because there is a need; there is no one who doesn\u2019t desire to live in peace.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand that the Armed Forces are there to keep the peace, to provide the ambiance that will enable each Nigerian to live his or her desires in peace and harmony. So let us not make inciting comments that will put the entire space on fire. That\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nRecall that the Lagos EndSARS Panel , yesterday submitted its report, accusing the Nigerian Army and Police force of shooting at the innocent protesters at the Lekki Tollgate on October 20 last year.\n\nThe panel also listed names of those killed and injured by security forces on the day of the Lekki Tollgate shooting, while recommending that those involved be dismissed.\n\nThe panel was inaugurated on October 19, 2020, to look into complaints of citizens against human rights abuses by the police, but following the October 20 incident, the Terms of Reference of the Panel was expanded to cover it.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the content of the report, Irabor declined, noting that he has not seen the official report.",

          "text": "The Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters (Lagos EndSARS Panel), has released a list of forty-eight casualties from the Lekki Tollgate incident.\n\nAnyone with emotion will always have goose pimples whenever, he/she remembers the incident that happened on October, especially 20th, 2020, where a good number of Nigerian citizens were allegedly massacred, police stations burnt, as anarchy descended on us.\n\nBe that as it may, the Lagos EndSARS Panel , yesterday submitted its report, accusing the Nigerian Army and Police force of shooting at the innocent protesters at Lekki Tollgate, last year.\n\nIn its report, Members of the Panel chaired by HONOURABLE JUSTICE DORIS OKUWOBI (RTD) submitted that: \u201cThe atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags, while singing the National Anthem can be equated to a \u2018massacre\u2019 in context. \u201c\n\nThe Panel equally stated that \u201cApart from the military men in uniform, the Army left its base with vehicles, rifles and guns, which contained both live and blank bullets. General Taiwo admitted at page 22 that the Army went to the Lekki Toll Gate with live ammunition.\n\n\u201cThe Panel finds as credible, the case of the EndSARS protesters that soldiers shot directly at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020 as confirmed by Lagos State Ballistic Expert, Willie-Harry on page 244 that some video evidence indicate \u201c\u2026 instances where troops were seen to be re-arming their weapons before either discharging them to the air or purposely in the direction of the protesters \u2026\u201d\n\nWith the report of the Lagos state Panel, did Lai Mohammed lie?\n\nBased on the report presented by the Lagos state Judicial panel, which accused the Nigerian Army and Police of mishandling the incident at Lekki Tollgate through firing of live bullets which as reported killed a good number of Nigerian citizens, one would say that it contradicts the Press Conference of the minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, where he averred that: \u201cThe military did not shoot at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020, and there was no massacre at the toll gate. The only \u2018massacre\u2019 recorded was in the social media, hence there were neither bodies nor blood.\u201d\n\nBelow is his statement\n\n\u201cToday marks the first anniversary of the phantom massacre at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, which was the culmination of an otherwise peaceful protest that was later hijacked by hoodlums. At earlier press conferences, I had called the reported massacre at the toll gate the first massacre in the world without blood or bodies. One year later, and despite ample opportunities for the families of those allegedly killed and those alleging a massacre to present evidence, there has been none: No bodies, no families, no convincing evidence, nothing. Where are the families of those who were reportedly killed at the toll gate? Did they show up at the Judicial Panel of Inquiry? If not, why?\n\n\u201cSadly, the champions of a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate, including Amnesty International and CNN, have continued to shamelessly hold on to their unproven stand. Recall, gentlemen, that after bandying different figures, Amnesty International finally settled at about 12 people killed. On its part, CNN went from 38 people killed to two to just one, after a supposed global exclusive even when the network had no reporter on ground at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that was set up by the Lagos State Government after the EndSARS protest wrapped up its sitting. During the sitting, CNN was summoned but it never showed up, thus missing a great opportunity to prove its allegation of massacre at the toll gate. Also, Amnesty International had a golden opportunity to convince the world, but it rather opted for issuing meaningless press releases.\n\n\u201cIn its latest attempt to grasp at straws and redeem whatever is left of its battered credibility on this issue, CNN has continued with its baseless report that soldiers shot at protesters. In a report currently running on the network, CNN brazenly and unashamedly held on to its flawed narrative, relying on an unidentified mother whose son was reportedly shot dead at Lekki, but without convincing evidence of who shot him dead. The same CNN that tweeted on Oct. 23rd 2020 that 38 people were shot dead at Lekki is now struggling to convince the world that one boy was killed at Lekki. What a shame!\n\n\u201cThe testimony of ballistic experts before the Judicial Panel of Inquiry in Lagos contradicts the tales by the moonlight by Amnesty International, CNN, a runaway DJ and their ilk. The experts, in their testimony, said inter alia:\n\n\u201dThe Team finds that from the medical data examined, including the timeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries sustained by the Victims, who were taken to the 5 medical facilities, that no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters (emphasis mine) at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the timeframe of reference (18.30-20.34hrs). That the GSW (Gun Shot Wounds) injuries (4 in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were examined by the Team, can be safely identified as being discharged by either low velocity caliber and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms (artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons). What is however certain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded. This was clearly not the case.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\n\u201cThe ballistic experts are not alone in reaching that conclusion. In its 2020 Country Report on Human Rights Practices, the U.S. State Department wrote:\n\n\u201cOn Oct. 20th (2020), members of the security forces enforced curfew by FIRING SHOTS INTO THE AIR (emphasis mine) to disperse protesters, who had gathered at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos to protest abusive practices by the Nigeria Police Force Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\n\u201cAccurate information on fatalities resulting from the shooting was not available at year\u2019s end. Amnesty International reported 10 persons died during the event, but the government disputed Amnesty\u2019s Report, and NO OTHER ORGANIZATION WAS ABLE TO VERIFY THE CLAIM (emphasis mine).\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the preponderance of evidence against any massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020, we are once again reiterating what we said one year ago, that:\n\ni) The military did not shoot at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020, and there was no massacre at the toll gate. The only \u2018massacre\u2019 recorded was in the social media, hence there were neither bodies nor blood. ii) Amnesty International, CNN, a runaway DJ and others like them should apologize for misleading the world that there was a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate and for portraying the Nigerian military, police and other security agencies in bad light.\n\niii) CNN acted unprofessionally by relying on unverified, and possibly-doctored social media videos, as well as other open-source information, to conclude that a massacre took place at the toll gate.\n\niv) The Federal Government remains proud of the security agencies for acting professionally and showing utmost restraint all through the EndSARS protest and the ensuing violence, an action that saved lives and properties. v) The six soldiers and 37 policemen who died during the EndSARS protests are human beings with families, even though the Human Rights Organizations and CNN simply ignored their deaths, choosing instead to trumpet a phantom massacre.\u201d\n\nVanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Super Eagles of Nigeria survived an intense battle against the Blue Sharks of Cape Verde to qualify for the final round of the African qualifying series for the 2022 FIFA World Cup finals.\n\nBefore the start, the three-time African champions led the Group C table with 12 points, with the visitors at 10, both had a chance to reach the final round and that gave the contest high importance.\n\nNapoli forward, Victor Osimhen scored the Super Eagles\u2019 only goal and then worked assiduously at the fore and elsewhere to ensure Nigeria got the ticket, and in the process picked up both the Man-of-the-Match and Most Valuable Player awards.\n\nNigeria got the best possible start when Victor Osimhen lashed in off a defensive mistake by Roberto Lopes after an in-swinger by Moses Simon caught the visitors\u2019 rearguard napping.\n\nOsimhen admits the Blue sharks had a good game and that makes the draw a valuable result for the Super Eagles.\n\n\u201cIt is good for us. The first leg wasn\u2019t easy, we know they have qualified players in their team and it\u2019s important for us to be on top of our game to get this sort of result to qualify for the final round and I\u2019m really happy about this,\u201d the former Lille striker stated.\n\nBut the lead was speedily erased when at the other end, William Ekong needlessly conceded a corner kick and then stood flat-footed as Stopyra connected to beat a flailing Maduka Okoye. This was in the 6th minute.\n\nFour minutes later, Alex Iwobi\u2019s shot was powerless to trouble goalkeeper Josimar Dias, and in the 24th minute, Leon Balogun\u2019s header from a corner kick flew away from goal.\n\nJoe Aribo could have scored but his shots in the 26th and 30th minutes narrowly missed the target.\n\nIn the 33rd minute, returnee forward Odion Ighalo should have scored with a free header as the inspired Osimhen found him with a pullout, but the wall went narrowly over.\n\nIn the second half, the Blue Sharks, realizing they needed to score to advance at the expense of the Super Eagles, piled the pressure and came close on a few occasions, but Nigeria held on and were able to keep things tight at the rear to reach the final round of the series, scheduled for March next year.\n\nCoach Rohr, as expected, praised his team and described the draw as a valuable win for the Eagles.\n\n\u201cIt was a good match, we had a draw that looks like a victory today. Some people were scared so we don\u2019t have the same scenario like Portugal. We did very well and defended very well. We have qualified for the next phase of the qualifiers, we can continue to dream,\u201d Rohr concluded.",

By themselves, plans are not a sufficient condition for progress; NO, they are a necessary precondition.\u201d\n\nOthers also hold the view that the Nigerian government consciously frustrates, blocks, threatens, frightens, deceives, intimidates, arrests and fleeces the private sector, and then blames the lack of economic growth on the price of crude oil.\n\nIn this interview, Atedo Peterside, economist, entrepreneur, and Founder of Stanbic IBTC and the ANAP Foundation, provides more insight into the new National Development Plan and the projection to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty over the next ten years, as envisaged under the plan.\n\nPeterside, who alongside the finance minister co-chaired the steering committee on the NDP, will also be giving us his thoughts on the report of the Lagos State Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters, which was presented yesterday to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.",

The station is in the green zone,\u201d the agency tweeted.\n\nThe wayward material passed by without incident, but its origin is now under the spotlight.\n\nIt appears to have come from a broken-up Russian satellite, Kosmos-1408. A spy satellite launched in 1982, it weighed over a tonne and had ceased working many years ago.\n\nLeoLabs, a space debris-tracking company, said its radar facility in New Zealand had picked up multiple objects where the long-defunct spacecraft should have been.\n\nMr Price described the Russian action as \u201cdangerous and irresponsible\u201d and said it demonstrated the country\u2019s \u201cclaims of opposing weaponisation of space are disingenuous and hypocritical.\n\n\u201cThe US will work with our partners and allies to respond to their irresponsible act,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the test \u201cshows a complete disregard for the security, safety and sustainability of space\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe debris resulting from this test will remain in orbit putting satellites and human spaceflight at risk for years to come,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to view anti-satellite missile tests as a form of madness.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to control the debris field that results from a high-velocity impact. Thousands of fragments are produced. Some will be propelled downwards towards Earth and out of harm\u2019s way, but many will also head to higher altitudes where they will harass operational missions for years into the future \u2013 including those of the nation state that carried out the test.\n\nWhat must the Russian cosmonauts on the space station have been thinking when they took shelter in their Soyuz capsule early on Monday because of the risk debris from this test might intersect with their orbital home?\n\nSpace junk is a rapidly worsening situation. Sixty-four years of activity above our heads means there are now roughly a million objects running around up there uncontrolled in the size range of 1cm (0.4in) to 10cm.\n\nAn impact from any one of these could be mission-ending for a vital weather or telecommunications satellite. Nations need to be clearing up the space environment, not polluting it still further.\n\nA number of countries have the ability to take out satellites from the ground, including the US, Russia, China and India.\n\nTesting of such missiles is rare, but always draws widespread condemnation whenever it occurs, because it pollutes the space environment for everyone.\n\nWhen China destroyed one of its retired weather satellites in 2007, it created more than 2,000 pieces of trackable debris. This material posed an ongoing hazard to operational space missions, not least those of China itself.\n\nBrian Weeden, an expert in space situational awareness, earlier said that if it was confirmed Russia had conducted a test that endangered the ISS, the conduct would have been \u201cbeyond irresponsible\u201d.\n\nThe space station occupies an orbital shell that other operators try to keep clear of hardware, either working or retired.\n\nHowever, the astronauts are increasingly having to take precautionary measures when fragments from old satellites and rockets come uncomfortably close.\n\nThe velocities at which this material moves means it could easily puncture the walls of the station\u2019s modules.\n\nPrecautionary measures usually involve closing hatches between the modules, and, as happened on Monday, climbing into the capsules that took the astronauts up to the station. These vehicles stay attached to the ISS throughout the crews\u2019 tours of duty in case there is a need for a rapid \u201clifeboat\u201d escape.",
