          "title": "FACT-CHECK: Does COVID-19 vaccine cause infertility in men, women?",
          "text": "By Justina Asishana\n\nIn Retrospect\n\nFreezing your sperm before taking a vaccine sounds scary, but do you really have to? The question came up recently in a health engagement in Niger state regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. A lot of questions were asked about how sure the facilitator, a Health Educator, that after taking the COVID-19 vaccine, one would be able to give birth.\n\nThis question was echoed by other participants. The Facilitator, Abubakar Kpantu, who is the Niger state Immunization Officer, admitted that he and his staff had been repeatedly queried on this by those who are eligible to take the vaccine. He later stated that the controversy was one of the causes of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the state.\n\nSome pictures have been going around on WhatsApp asking men to freeze their sperm and women to freeze their eggs before embarking on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. One of the picture received by the Reporter is shown below:\n\nVERIFICATION\n\nUsing the Google Reversed Image, it was shown that the picture was a screenshot taken from some articles while further search showed that it may have first be written by local10.com in its article titled \u2018Study investigates effects of COVID-19 vaccine on male fertility\u2019 on December 20, 2020, with bylines of Kristi Krueger, Anchor/Health Reporter and Kathleen Corso, Special Projects Producer.\n\nGoogle Reverse Image Search is a part of Google search that allows one to search the internet using images instead of writing words. By sharing a specific image with your search engine, it will go on to find others like it.\n\nIn the article referred above, it was stated that The University of Miami was investigating the possible effects of the coronavirus vaccine on male fertility and advised participants to have a fertility evaluation before receiving the vaccine.\n\nIt concluded with these words, \u201cTo protect fertility, some men may want to consider freezing their sperm before vaccination.\u201d It is weird they are talking about \u2018the vaccine\u2019 in this article because as at 2020, the vaccine was still in its testing/early stage.\n\nDigging deeper and going online using Tweetdeck and Who Posted What, there were trends of posts that retweeted and shared the articles and some people may have screenshot it to start sharing on WhatsApp.\n\nOne of the tweets seen with handle @michellemalkin who is a syndicated writer and vaccine sceptic showed that her tweet was retweeted 8,226 times with quote tweets of 2,001 times. But why the post which was tweeted in 2020 and the article which was written in 2020 and shared recently in 2021 showed that anti-vaxxers may want to dissuade people from taking the vaccine, a situation which is already been seen to be causing vaccine hesitancy\n\nThis is because in 2020 \u2018the COVID-19 vaccine\u2019 was still in its trial/early phase but now, there is a much larger body of data on the fertility and the vaccine: majority of which points that basically, there is no impact on fertility, and even pregnant women are advised to take the vaccines.\n\nUsing Hoaxy to view the network of misinformation about the flow of the information in the last seven days, from 19th to 24th May, it was observed by this Reporter that majority of the posts tweeted and retweeted were by governments and the country\u2019s centre for diseases control explaining that the vaccine does not affect fertility in men and women.\n\nWhere did the Infertility Myth/Controversy Start?\n\nIn 2020, a former vice president of Pfizer, Michael Yeadon, alongside some other persons wrote a petition to Europe\u2019s medicines regulator demanding that the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials should be stopped. They speculated that the vaccines could cause infertility in women.\n\nFurther investigations showed that their speculations were without evidence. However, because Yeadon was not just anyone but a former vice president of Pfizer which is one of the pharmaceutical companies producing the vaccine, social media were awash with the unverified claims that COVID-19 vaccine causes female infertility and this started the flow of misinformation that the vaccines cause infertility.\n\nExpert\u2019s View\n\nThe Medical Director and Chief Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist of Queens Specialist Hospital, Abuja, Dr Martins Oche Ejembi explained that vaccines are supposed to provide immunity against one or several diseases and in the COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccine is supposed to provide immunity against the COVID-19 virus.\n\nAccording to him, the COVID-19 virus itself can affect the fertility of both male and female explaining that in the male, it affects the testicles, causes sperm problems in terms of movement, morphology, swimming ability and ability to fertilize.\n\n\u201cSo also with the women, COVID-19 affects the ovaries where the eggs are produced. In a way, acute infection of COVID-19 can lead to infertility in both men and female because the egg is part of the process that reproduces for the woman and the sperm for the man. And when they come together, they form a zygote which transforms into a baby. So when all these organs involved in reproduction are affected, it affects fertility. \u201d\n\nFor the COVID-19 vaccine, Ejembi said, \u201cThe vaccine is supposed to prevent serious infection when taken. It is supposed to help stop the progress of COVID-19 in the body. We know that the virus itself can in a way attack fertility. COVID-19 studies have shown that COVID-19 has been seen in vagina fluids, in semen and it travels fast to the reproductive organs, so we know that at that level, it can affect fertility organs but the vaccine which is supposed to contra or to fight the virus itself cannot be said to be causing infertility.\u201d\n\nThe Obstetrician and Gynecology Specialist further said that studies on the COVID-19 vaccine have reassured that the vaccine in question has no immediate effect on fertility adding that \u201cIt is, however, too early for us to be able to say that the vaccine affects fertility. The rumour circulating that the vaccine is meant to reduce our population is far from the truth. For now, we don\u2019t know what the long term effect of the vaccine would be on reproductivity.\u201d\n\nEjembi further said that studies are being done to see if the vaccines can affect the reproductive organs and cause infertility adding that, \u201cOnly when the time comes that we will be able to ascribe that the vaccine is the cause of this problem or that problem. Studies are being done to see how it will affect fertility and reproductive organs. But for what is known scientifically now, the vaccine will not cause infertility but the virus will.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat Other Authorities Say\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the advice section regarding COVID-19 and Pregnancy, titled \u201cPeople who would like to have a baby\u201d, it reads: \u201cIf you are trying to become pregnant now or want to get pregnant in the future, you can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems\u2014problems trying to get pregnant.\n\n\u201cCDC does not recommend routine pregnancy testing before COVID-19 vaccination. If you are trying to become pregnant, you do not need to avoid pregnancy after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Like with all vaccines, scientists are studying COVID-19 vaccines carefully for side effects now and will report findings as they become available. \u2013 Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is no information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine affecting fertility or infertility in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the website of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) or the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA); however, there was Information regarding pregnant women using the vaccine in the NPHCDA website.\n\nThe Agency on its website stated that \u201cAvailable data on vaccination of pregnant women are insufficient to assess vaccine efficacy or vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. However, the vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell and is degraded quickly.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, WHO does not recommend vaccination in pregnancy, unless the benefit of vaccinating a pregnant woman outweighs the potential vaccine risks, such as in health workers at high risk of exposure and those pregnant women with comorbidities placing them in a high-risk group for severe COVID-19. Pregnant women should consult their doctors.\u201d\n\nFact Check\n\nFreezing your sperm before taking a vaccine sounds scary, and if this was true, you\u2019d be wary of taking the vaccine if you wanted to have kids, but you don\u2019t need to do this because there is no proof to show that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility in men and women.\n\nStudies are still underway to show the long term effect of the vaccine on fertility but studies have further shown that COVID-19 can cause infertility but the vaccine which is supposed to mitigate the effect of the virus should be seen to be solutionist to this situation.\n\nTherefore, there is no need to freeze your sperm before taking COVID-19 vaccine as the claim that COVID-19 vaccines infertility is Misleading and tends to contribute to Vaccine Hesitancy.",
          "summary": "He later stated that the controversy was one of the causes of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the state.\n\u201dFor the COVID-19 vaccine, Ejembi said, \u201cThe vaccine is supposed to prevent serious infection when taken.\nThere is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems\u2014problems trying to get pregnant.\nHowever, the vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell and is degraded quickly.\nTherefore, there is no need to freeze your sperm before taking COVID-19 vaccine as the claim that COVID-19 vaccines infertility is Misleading and tends to contribute to Vaccine Hesitancy.",

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nThe Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 pandemic has said the Federal Government would enforce penalties, including deactivating the travel passports of violators of recent travel advisory for travellers from India, Brazil and Turkey.\n\nThe Federal Government, in the last three weeks, had published names and other travel particulars of more than 220 alleged violators of the travel advisory, who evaded protocols set for travellers from the said countries of concern.\n\nSpeaking during the PSC\u2019s media briefing in Abuja yesterday, Chairman of the Committee and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, also said Nigeria had been taking the precautionary measures to ensure that the country is kept safe from experiencing a third wave of the pandemic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Mustapha, besides deactivating passports of the Nigerian violators, the foreign offenders would have their visas revoked and prosecution, where applicable, would be an option.\n\n\u201cPursuant to the travel advisory issued, I wish to inform you that the PSC has initiated series of sanctions against those that have violated the 2021 Health Safety Regulations.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the PSC has published the names and particulars of over two hundred violators that evaded the quarantine requirement.\n\n\u201cThis is considered a serious infraction and the PSC will proceed to do the following: deactivate the passports of Nigerians involved for a period of not less than one year; revoke the visas of foreigners that have abused our hospitality; and prosecute the violators where necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the PSC has explained that the country would sustain to be vigilant with the national response process to prevent an outbreak of a third wave. It urged Nigerians to continue to take responsibility by continuing to observe the non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n\u201cThe PSC, therefore, appeals to all Nigerians to continue to observe the non-pharmaceutical interventions diligently. Similarly, Nigerians must eschew sentiments by ensuring that friends, relations and associates arriving from countries of concern and indeed all countries obey the quarantine and post arrival protocols. It is our duty to make sure this occurs.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to monitor the unfolding events and will deal with them as applicable. Nigeria cannot afford a third wave and thus will do everything to protect our territory.\n\n\u201cIn the next couple of weeks, the PSC will focus on three major things, increase testing especially in the states; increase oxygen reserve capacity in case there is a third wave and increase vaccine acquisition drive.\n\n\u201cWhile we watch and study developments around the world, we must continue to disseminate the messages of compliance with the protocols prescribed and to get vaccinated when the opportunity arises.\n\n\u201cThe philosophy is for us to keep out the virus as much as possible. India is still quite high in a number of cases and in the last week, the numbers in Africa experienced a spike, especially in South Africa\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the faceoff between the country and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) flights restrictions, he said Nigeria is still in talks with the authorities, assuring that the outcome of the parley would be in the interest of the country.\n\n\u201cFor some times now, Nigeria has been discussing with the authorities of the United Arab Emirates on the resumption of flights between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe PSC will urge the United Arabs Emirates to remove its specific and discriminatory practices against Nigeria. Discussions are, however, ongoing and we can assure Nigerians that the outcome will be in the interest of the country,\u201d he assured.\n\nOn vaccination front, Mustapha informed that around 2 million Nigerians had so far been vaccinated, adding that much progress had been recorded in the campaign against vaccine hesitancy in the country.\n\n\u201cSome 12 weeks ago, the NPHCDA commenced the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine across the nation with about 2 million persons vaccinated so far.\n\n\u201cWe have since then intensified the creation of awareness to achieve a reduction of vaccine hesitancy and encourage all eligible persons to come out and take their second dose.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend, His Excellencies, the President and the Vice President received their second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Today, members of the PSC will receive their second dose during this briefing. This transparency is to underscore the safety of the vaccine,\u201d he said.",

Whatever happened is unfortunate and I believe God has a reason for everything. I have put all behind me and moved on.\n\n\u201cAs I have consistently advised, please, be magnanimous in victory. You are the governor of all Edo people, regardless of political leanings. Once again, congratulations Excellency! Please, accept the renewed assurances of my very best wishes and high regards.\u201d\n\nIze-Iyamu also yesterday pleaded with Obaseki to consider the pertinent issue of the 14 constituencies that were at present without representation at the House of Assembly, with only 10 members sitting.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the matter was in court, he urged the governor to intervene, through out-of-court settlement, in the interest of Edo, thereby ensuring peace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also congratulated Obaseki on his victory at the apex court.\n\nIze-Iyamu, the former Secretary to Edo State Government (SSG), urged the governor to intervene in the issue of elected local government chairmen, vice chairmen, councillors and supervisory councillors, who were sometime ago suspended and removed from office.\n\nHe enjoined him to consider paying them their entitlements, since it was now late for them to return to their offices, which he said could also be settled out of court.",

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nA grand design to boost Nigeria\u2019s internal security and revenue has made the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) to beam its searchlight on private jet owners, who are now mandated to carry out an immediate verification of their aircraft to ensure they are operating legally as enshrined in the Federal Government\u2019s extant laws.\n\nNCS Public Relations Officer, Joseph Attah, during a press briefing in Abuja, yesterday, said defaulters will be visited with the full weight of the law, saying no one will be treated as a sacred cow.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn line with the need to ensure strict compliance with all regulations, especially at this time of challenging security situation and reluctance of some highly placed individuals to pay taxes, NCS will be taking stock of all privately-owned aircraft in the country. This is to ensure strict compliance with all relevant regulations governing importation of such aircraft.\n\n\u201cConsequently, NCS, in line with its statutory functions as provided for in Part III Sections 27, 35, 37, 45, 46, 47, 52, 56, 63 & 64; Part XI Sections 144, 145, 155, 160, 161 & 164 and Part XII Sections 167, 168, 169 173 & 174 of the Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA), hereby invites owners of private aircraft in the country to come forward with their relevant importation clearance documents for verification.\u201d\n\nAttah said the documents sought for verification are: aircraft certificate of registration, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s (NCAA) Flight Operations Compliance Certificate, NCAA\u2019s Maintenance Compliance Certificate, NCAA\u2019s Permit for Non-Commercial Flights and Temporary Import Permit (where application).\n\nHe noted that all private jet owners or their representatives are to report to room 305, Tariff and Trade Department, NCS Headquarters, Abuja from Monday, June 7 through Tuesday, July 6, 2021 between 10:00am and 5:00pm daily, with relevant aircraft documents for verification.\n\nWhile clarifying that private jets do not pay Customs duties, Attah said such airplanes are expected to pay the mandatory Comprehensive Imports Supervision Scheme (CISS) charges.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure all charges due to the government are paid. The move is not punitive but to ensure compliance. If deficiencies are found, there will be room for correction.\n\n\u201cWe are aware Nigeria is facing security challenges and there is a downturn in global economy and so any legitimate thing that will boost our revenue is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe need to know who owns what and we want to know how they came in to ensure nothing untoward happened,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the likely sanctions defaulters might face, Attah said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to jump the gun on sanctions. But it depends on the gravity of the offence. We are not in a position to pre-empt anything. We believe private jet owners are highly-placed individuals that will do the right thing. They\u2019ll will do what the law says.\u201d\n\nIn another development, Attah disclosed Customs generated N799,024,705,961 between January 1 and May 30 this year.\n\nThe Customs spokesman described the figure as glaring improvement on N226,110,610,991 generated within the same period in 2020.\n\nHe said the feat was made possible due to strict implementation of all extant rules governing imports, exports and excise in Nigeria, strategic deployment of officers, automation of the processes and regulations, increasing inclination of officers and men to put national interest above selves, robust stakeholders\u2019 sensitisation, increasing level of compliance from stakeholders and improved working relation with National Assembly.\n\nAttah disclosed those who passed the aptitude test of the ongoing recruitment exercise have been invited for physical screening.\n\n\u201cWe are now ensuring we sieve out the issues like health, height and others, and soon, the final list will be out. Then, they\u2019ll come for documentation and later proceed for training,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "One minute silence observed six times at Senate plenary Tuesday\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Emameh Gabriel\n\nThe Senate has expressed concern over the spate of one minute silence usually observed at its plenary as a result of deaths associated with security challenges facing the nation.\n\nThis is just as the upper chamber at Tuesday\u2019s plenary observed one minute silence six times for those who lost their lives through killings and murders in the wake of security issues across the country.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, who made this observation during plenary, however, stressed the need for the National Assembly to increase its legislative interventions towards ensuring adequate security of lives and property in the country.\n\nSpeaking during plenary after the Senate observed one minute silence six times to honour Nigerians who lost their lives to various forms of insecurity in the country, Lawan said: \u201cLet me observe that we have observed about six one-minute silences and most of it was to pray for the repose of the souls of Nigerians who were murdered or killed by criminals.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, emphasised that legislative interventions must be stepped up by the National Assembly to protect Nigerians against the heightening spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to him, it is imperative for the National Assembly to step up legislative interventions to reduce the number of deaths caused by criminal activities.\n\nHe added that such interventions would be backed by collaborative efforts between the legislature, executive and Nigerians to address Nigeria\u2019s security challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is very important that we step up our legislative intervention in ensuring that we protect the lives and properties of Nigerians to reduce the incidence of one-minute silence.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Senate and, indeed, the National Assembly, working together with the executive and getting the support of Nigerians, we can bring the much needed succour to our people and that is why we are here.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

There were also no human and vehicular movements within Abakaliki, the capital city.\n\nAn official of one of the banks at Awka, who sought not to be named, said in an interview with THISDAY that \u201cI am not in the office. The bank will not work for today. Who do you want to go to bank so that these people will come and kill them? I am at home. There is no movement and so who will you attend to?\u201d\n\nHowever, some people who defied the directive and went out in the early hours of yesterday returned home with injuries and their belongings destroyed.\n\nAll the streets were also deserted with heavy presence of security agencies and operatives of Ebubeagu at some designated junctions.\n\nViolence, resulting in sporadic gunshots and destruction of property, were witnessed in some parts of Ebonyi State.\n\nThe sporadic gun duel between the police and the agitators within Ebebe junction in Abakaliki capital city reportedly claimed five lives.\n\nWhile the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Aliyu Garba, confirmed that some of the suspected agitators were arrested, there was no official report on the alleged death of a policeman and four IPOB members.\n\nHowever, a source at the Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, said the police brought in about four corpses to the morgue.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that some of the agitators divided themselves into groups and laid ambush in a forest along Ogbaga Road, where they intercepted anyone who flouted the directive on sit-at-home. They were said to have beaten up the violators and set their belongings ablaze.\n\nAn eyewitness said that many motorcycles were burnt while their riders fled with injuries.\n\nA student of Ebonyi State University also told THISDAY that the sit-at-home order disrupted academic activities.\n\nAnother school proprietor had also notified to parents and guardians earlier that the school would not open today.\n\nEmpty streets, deserted roads, closed shops and business premises characterised the observance of the Biafra Day in Umuahia, the Abia State capital and Aba, the commercial nerve centre of the state.\n\nResidents of the two major Abia cities fully complied with the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe city centre of Umuahia was devoid of its usual bustling commercial activities as people remained in indoors.\n\nCommercial transporters also withdrew their vehicles, while private vehicles deserted the roads.\n\nGovernment institutions were also affected by the sit-at-home directive as schools and government offices did not open.\n\nBanks and other corporate businesses equally shut their gates.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, there was no presence of the police and other security agencies patrolling the streets in Umuahia.\n\nThe separatist agitators also comported themselves peacefully while marking the Biafra Day as there was no street parade, which usually attracted heavy response from security agencies as happened on previous occasions.\n\nKanu had while giving directives on the observance of this year\u2019s Biafra Day strictly warned against any street protest, saying that people should stay indoors and mourn the fallen heroes.\n\nThe order also recorded total compliance in Enugu State.\n\nAs early as 8am yesterday, major markets within the Enugu metropolis, including Abakpa, New Haven, Garki, and Holy Ghost were shut.\n\nMarkets in Nsukka areas were also empty.\n\nMotor parks and other commercial places were equally deserted.\n\nStreets that were usually filled with people were empty even as there were no vehicular movements.\n\nPolice patrol vans were seen around Okpara Avenue, adjacent to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) office, Enugu.\n\nThe Enugu State Police Command had on Sunday, urged the residents of the state to disregard the order, warning that anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions would be dealt with.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists by the Police Public Relations Officer, Enugu State Command, Daniel Ndukwe, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, had enjoined residents of the state to remain law-abiding, vigilant, as they went about their legitimate businesses.\n\nThe order also recorded 100 per cent compliance in Imo State.\n\nPrevious directives to mark the declaration of Biafra did not record the level of compliance observed in the state yesterday.\n\nAnalysts, however, attributed the total compliance this year to the heightened insecurity in the state.\n\nThe murder of a top chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and former political adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Hon. Ahmed Gulak, on Sunday morning had heightened the fears of Imo residents and forced them to stay indoors.\n\nAll the major streets in the state capital and every entry and exit points to and from the state were empty as motorists and travellers avoided passing through the state. The ever-busy Wetheral Road, Douglas Road, Royce Road, Okigwe Road, Orlu Road, Onitsha Road, Port Harcourt Road and Aba Road were all empty.\n\nHowever, security agents were alleged to have used the occasion of sit-at-home order to raid some of the hostels and lodges of students of Imo State University, Owerri (IMSU) to arrest some of them.\n\nA tweet from one of the student leaders had alerted the public to the arrest.\n\nEfforts to speak with the state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, a Superintendent of Police, proved abortive as he did not answer calls placed to his phone.\n\nShedding light on why there was total compliance with the sit-at-home order, spokesman of the pan-Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Hon. Alex Ogbonnia, told THISDAY from his residence in Enugu that every Igbo person felt the sense of injustice against the Igbo in Nigeria and was a willing participant in the sit-at-home protest to register their displeasure.\n\nHe said: \u201cEven the governors of the South-east states know what is happening. It is a simple way of showing that the marginalisation of the Igbo is becoming unbearable. We are hoping the presidency will address some of these concerns. If for instance, an Igbo man is announced as the Inspector General of Police or Chief of Army Staff, the people will jubilate. If there is a consensus to cede the presidency to the South-east in 2023, all these agitations will die naturally. You can\u2019t continue to oppress a people who are very hardworking and contribute so much to the development of the country and expect them to celebrate their subjugation.\u201d\n\nAlso, President of Igbo Youth Movement, Mr. Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, said the refusal of the federal government to discuss with the agitators had strengthened their resolve to press home their demands.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe strange policy to only shoot and destroy the agitators without ever inviting them to present their position has convinced the people of this region that they are in a hostile political jail. The world over and all through history when between 5,000 and 10,000 people agitate about a situation the government of the land invites them to present their grievance. Nigeria is the only country where hundreds of thousands of people have been protesting over a particular situation in the last 21 years and the government continues to refuse to listen to them. Instead, thousands of them have been killed in cold blood.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Eight Abductions That Shook Nigeria",
          "text": "The abduction of Nigerians by armed gunmen has worsened the problem of insecurity in the country. Though, it happens all over Nigeria, the Northern part of country still remains a hotbed of kidnappings by terrorists and bandits.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the victims of these abductions have lost their lives in the process, many regained their freedom through the intervention of the security agents or the payment of ransoms by family members.\n\n\n\nHowever, abduction of schoolchildren is on the rise, and here are eight major cases of kidnapping of pupils and students that have happened in Nigeria;\n\nAbducted Dapchi girls\n\n\n\n276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in Chibok, Borno in April 2014\n\n\n\nOn the night of April 14, 2014, when the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination was ongoing, the deadly Boko Haram terrorists invaded Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School in Chibok town of Borno State and kidnapped 247 girls aged 16 to 18 in their dormitories.\n\n\n\nThe ugly incident was greeted by rage and criticism from local scene and the international community, while some political analysts said it was aimed at bringing down the government of the then President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nThis brought about a movement of #BringBackOurGirls protest in Nigeria spearheaded by a former Education Minister, Oby Ezekwesili. The former first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama supported the movement by tweeting about it.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces in their persistent efforts have rescued close to 100 of them. 57 of them escaped immediately after the attack, as they jumped from the trucks conveying them to the terrorist den. And till date, over 100 of the Chibok girls are still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n110 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Dapchi, Yobe in February 2018\n\n\n\nBoko Haram terrorists carried out their second abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria on February 19, 2018 in the evening at the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State. They carted away 110 girls between the ages of 11 and 19 around 5:30 pm that day.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian government tasked the nation\u2019s security agencies to find the girls. The Nigerian Air Force and Nigeria Army deployed their men to search for them, but all to no avail.\n\n\n\nHowever, the terrorist group released 104 girls in March of that same year after a purported negotiation was reached with the Nigerian government. There were reports that five of them died on the day of the abduction.

          "text": "The abduction of Nigerians by armed gunmen has worsened the problem of insecurity in the country. Though, it happens all over Nigeria, the Northern part of country still remains a hotbed of kidnappings by terrorists and bandits.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the victims of these abductions have lost their lives in the process, many regained their freedom through the intervention of the security agents or the payment of ransoms by family members.\n\n\n\nHowever, abduction of schoolchildren is on the rise, and here are eight major cases of kidnapping of pupils and students that have happened in Nigeria;\n\nAbducted Dapchi girls\n\n\n\n276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in Chibok, Borno in April 2014\n\n\n\nOn the night of April 14, 2014, when the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination was ongoing, the deadly Boko Haram terrorists invaded Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School in Chibok town of Borno State and kidnapped 247 girls aged 16 to 18 in their dormitories.\n\n\n\nThe ugly incident was greeted by rage and criticism from local scene and the international community, while some political analysts said it was aimed at bringing down the government of the then President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nThis brought about a movement of #BringBackOurGirls protest in Nigeria spearheaded by a former Education Minister, Oby Ezekwesili. The former first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama supported the movement by tweeting about it.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces in their persistent efforts have rescued close to 100 of them. 57 of them escaped immediately after the attack, as they jumped from the trucks conveying them to the terrorist den. And till date, over 100 of the Chibok girls are still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n110 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Dapchi, Yobe in February 2018\n\n\n\nBoko Haram terrorists carried out their second abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria on February 19, 2018 in the evening at the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State. They carted away 110 girls between the ages of 11 and 19 around 5:30 pm that day.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian government tasked the nation\u2019s security agencies to find the girls. The Nigerian Air Force and Nigeria Army deployed their men to search for them, but all to no avail.\n\n\n\nHowever, the terrorist group released 104 girls in March of that same year after a purported negotiation was reached with the Nigerian government. There were reports that five of them died on the day of the abduction. One girl, Leah Sharibu was not released by Boko Haram under the claims that she refused to renounce her Christian faith.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 300 schoolboys abducted in Kankara, Katsina in December 2020\n\n\n\nA gang of gunmen suspected to be bandits with links to Boko Haram terrorists attacked the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State to Abduct over 300 boys on December 11, 2020.

          "text": "New information available to SaharaReporters shows how the suspended Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman, lied to her superiors and sabotaged the plan by the Nigerian government to decongest Lagos ports by dredging the Calabar Port.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Usman lied to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and the Senate about the recommendations of a committee she had set up to investigate the dredging project at the Calabar Port.\n\nHadiza Bala Usman\n\nHer lies have cost Nigeria lives, billions of naira and jobs as Nigeria continues to rely on Lagos ports with its attendant congestion and other problems, it was also gathered.\n\nFor instance, widespread congestion at the Lagos ports costs Nigeria $55 million (about N20.8 billion) daily, according to a 2020 report by Dynanmar, a Dutch consultancy firm.\n\nAccording to sources in the industry, Usman consistently lied to Osinbajo, Chairman of the Presidential Task Team on the Apapa gridlock, tasked with the job of decongesting the Lagos ports, that dredging the Calabar Port was not viable.\n\nThe project is under Calabar Channel Management, a joint venture operation between a consortium led by Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited and the Nigerian Ports Authority.\n\nFollowing allegations that money was paid for dredging at Calabar Port with nothing to show for it, Usman set up a committee to investigate three allegations: One, that Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited did not follow due process in carrying out the job; two, that dredging Calabar Ports is not viable and must not be done; and three, that work was not done on the site by the company.\n\nThe report of the committee along with other documents sighted by SaharaReporters indeed prove that work had commenced at Calabar Port and that it was viable, but Usman ignored the report of the committee and insisted that the job must be stopped.\n\nSources privy to the issue said Usman took the position because he wanted the job for her cronies and not a neutral company.\n\nOne of the sources privy to the committee\u2019s report said, \u201cShe (Hadiza Bala-Usman) has been hiding the truth. The job was suspended after President Muhammadu Buhari came in. There were allegations that money was paid and that the job was not done. Then she set up a committee.\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been in charge of how they can reduce traffic in Lagos so he put pressure on her and she said she would set up a committee to make recommendations. She was in London, UK when the report came out but said nobody should sign the report.\n\n\u201cLater, she granted interviews to newspapers, saying the committee indicted the company (Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited), which was totally a lie. Her lies have cost the country so much money because dredging the Calabar Port would have decongested Lagos ports. It would have made more money for the government and created many jobs.\n\n\u201cThe committee members; we said we had to sign it. Later she said we should sign. But when Osinbajo and the Senate asked about it, she said the job should not continue, contrary to what is in the report. She told the Vice President that dredging should not be done because it was not viable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirmed the first (that Niger Global followed due process) and we hired a consultant from Switzerland to find out if work had been done and they showed work had been done. Nigerian Navy also wrote that they provided security for the dredger at the time it was working.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss company is called Coastal And Reclamation Engineering Services, popularly referred to as CARES. This company is being appointed by the NPA to regularly audit the three channel management namely; Lagos Channel Management (LCM), Bonny Channel Management (BCM) and Calabar Channel Management (CCM). Payments of work done can only be made to contractors after CARES audited the job and confirmed that work was done.\n\n\u201cThe company also confirmed that work had started there but she hid the truth and refused to share the content of the report with the Ministry of Transportation. And not dredging the Calabar Port is costing Nigeria a lot in terms of money and jobs for the teeming population.\n\n\u201cUsman mischievously questioned the work of its one hired Auditors (CARES) on Calabar channel management but at the same time accepted and made payments to LCM and BCM on the advice of the same auditor. She wanted to give the job to her cronies and consistently lied to the Vice President, AGF and the Senate.\n\n\u201cNobody except the members knows the content of the committee\u2019s report, not the Vice President or even the Ministry of Transportation or the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. She is interested in taking the job and giving it to her cronies,\u201d another source said.\n\nSaharaReporters sighted the report of the committee set up to review the activities of Calabar Channel Management Limited done in November 2016.\n\nThe committee members are listed as: Prof Idris Abubakar, Executive Director, E&TS; Engr. Peter Obinomen, General Manager, Capital Projects; Engr. A. R. Mohammed, General Manager, PP&D; Engr. A. A. Jatto, General Manager, Engineering Maintenance; A. A. Ningi, General Manager, Audit; Nana Yakubu, Assistant General Manager, Legal; Surveyor O. Omotoso, Assistant General Manager, Hydro; Engr M. U. Isa, Principal Manager, BD&JV.\n\nThe committee\u2019s terms of reference were stated thus: \u201cto carry out a holistic review of the Joint Venture Agreement between the NPA and Niger Global, to examine the request for payments by Niger Global received vide letter ref. T0160/S107/IXA/205 dated 15th August, 2016 from the office of the Minister of Transportation, to examine the operational and administrative effectiveness of CCM, to make appropriate recommendations to management.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations of the committee among others as stated in the document say, \u201cHaving verified volumes dredged, all outstanding payments due to CCML should be effected in line with the provisions of the JV Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat in view of the subsisting presidential approval for the JV, CCML be allowed to continue with its operation but at a reduced scale to be determined by the authority\u2019s need and CCML\u2019s Board Technical and Finance Committees.\n\n\u201cThat henceforth, a multi-disciplinary project management team made of civil engineers, surveyors, hydrographers be appointed with definite responsibility to manage the dredging activities of all the channel management companies (LCM, BCC &CCML).\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter she wrote to the Minister of Justice, Malami, the suspended NPA MD said the contractor connived with the consultant and lied to the NPA that work was done. She also lied to the minister that no key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done.\n\nThe letter dated June 5, 2018 and received by the ministry on June 8, 2018 was signed by I.G. Umar, Assistant General Manager, Board, for NPA Managing Director.\n\nThe letter was titled \u2018Re: Execution Summary of the Entire Argument Surrounding the Calabar Channel Management Contract at the Truth Verifiably Documentary Evidence\u2019.\n\nPart of Usman\u2019s letter to Malami read: \u201cThe committee found amongst others; that the Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer (two key officers) who should be involved in the dredging exercise denied that any dredging activities took place within the period claimed by Niger Global, the ship movement of the dredgers MV Atlantico, MV Hurricane and MV Waterway could not be substantiated by the Calabar port, the pre and post comparison of the depth of the channel with a survey carried out six months before the dredging exercise revealed that the alleged dredging of the areas of the channel was questionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this same consultant is having a valid contact with the NPA and it is the same consultant that is confirming work of both Bonny and Lagos channel managements and the same MD is making payment to these companies on the basis of confirmation of work by the same consultant she\u2019s accusing of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe second big lie she told the minister is that no any key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nBut the report of the committee shows that Port Hydrographer, a key officer of the NPA, was a member of the technical committee and signed under a report which confirmed that work was done.\n\nA letter from the Nigerian Navy dated July 2017 with ref VT: 015/73/200/Vol.IV/70, made available to SaharaReporters also showed the suspended NPA MD was hiding the true state of things.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Managing Director, Calabar Channel Management Company, was titled, \u2018Provision of Security Services to the Dredging Company for Calabar Channel for the period 20 November, 2014 to 15 January, 2015\u2019.\n\nIt says, \u201cThis is to confirm that the Nigerian Navy through NNS VICTORY Calabar provided all the security services to the personnel and equipment of Calabar Channel Management Company for the successful execution of dredging exercise. The operation was hitch-free based on our assessment hence there was no security breach during the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment, nobody including the minister (Amaechi) and the President is aware of the true outcome of that committee report because she refused to let them have a copy of the report and she only keeps telling them and Nigerians that the committee report indicted the contractor.\n\n\u201cShe has granted many interviews in which she told lies about the whole contract. She\u2019s a pathological liar and always knows how to get away with all this. Her arrogance and disregard for working ethics have cost Nigeria a lot and still cost Nigeria hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. She is the reason why Calabar Port has not been dredged and Lagos ports decongested,\u201d added one of the sources.\n\nDocuments by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Channel_Committee Review Signed Copy by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Port Update Post Privatization Monitoring by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nJoint Confirmatory Survey by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

Then she set up a committee.\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been in charge of how they can reduce traffic in Lagos so he put pressure on her and she said she would set up a committee to make recommendations. She was in London, UK when the report came out but said nobody should sign the report.\n\n\u201cLater, she granted interviews to newspapers, saying the committee indicted the company (Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited), which was totally a lie. Her lies have cost the country so much money because dredging the Calabar Port would have decongested Lagos ports. It would have made more money for the government and created many jobs.\n\n\u201cThe committee members; we said we had to sign it. Later she said we should sign. But when Osinbajo and the Senate asked about it, she said the job should not continue, contrary to what is in the report. She told the Vice President that dredging should not be done because it was not viable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirmed the first (that Niger Global followed due process) and we hired a consultant from Switzerland to find out if work had been done and they showed work had been done. Nigerian Navy also wrote that they provided security for the dredger at the time it was working.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss company is called Coastal And Reclamation Engineering Services, popularly referred to as CARES. This company is being appointed by the NPA to regularly audit the three channel management namely; Lagos Channel Management (LCM), Bonny Channel Management (BCM) and Calabar Channel Management (CCM). Payments of work done can only be made to contractors after CARES audited the job and confirmed that work was done.\n\n\u201cThe company also confirmed that work had started there but she hid the truth and refused to share the content of the report with the Ministry of Transportation. And not dredging the Calabar Port is costing Nigeria a lot in terms of money and jobs for the teeming population.\n\n\u201cUsman mischievously questioned the work of its one hired Auditors (CARES) on Calabar channel management but at the same time accepted and made payments to LCM and BCM on the advice of the same auditor. She wanted to give the job to her cronies and consistently lied to the Vice President, AGF and the Senate.\n\n\u201cNobody except the members knows the content of the committee\u2019s report, not the Vice President or even the Ministry of Transportation or the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. She is interested in taking the job and giving it to her cronies,\u201d another source said.\n\nSaharaReporters sighted the report of the committee set up to review the activities of Calabar Channel Management Limited done in November 2016.\n\nThe committee members are listed as: Prof Idris Abubakar, Executive Director, E&TS; Engr. Peter Obinomen, General Manager, Capital Projects; Engr. A. R. Mohammed, General Manager, PP&D; Engr. A. A. Jatto, General Manager, Engineering Maintenance; A. A. Ningi, General Manager, Audit; Nana Yakubu, Assistant General Manager, Legal; Surveyor O. Omotoso, Assistant General Manager, Hydro; Engr M. U. Isa, Principal Manager, BD&JV.\n\nThe committee\u2019s terms of reference were stated thus: \u201cto carry out a holistic review of the Joint Venture Agreement between the NPA and Niger Global, to examine the request for payments by Niger Global received vide letter ref. T0160/S107/IXA/205 dated 15th August, 2016 from the office of the Minister of Transportation, to examine the operational and administrative effectiveness of CCM, to make appropriate recommendations to management.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations of the committee among others as stated in the document say, \u201cHaving verified volumes dredged, all outstanding payments due to CCML should be effected in line with the provisions of the JV Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat in view of the subsisting presidential approval for the JV, CCML be allowed to continue with its operation but at a reduced scale to be determined by the authority\u2019s need and CCML\u2019s Board Technical and Finance Committees.\n\n\u201cThat henceforth, a multi-disciplinary project management team made of civil engineers, surveyors, hydrographers be appointed with definite responsibility to manage the dredging activities of all the channel management companies (LCM, BCC &CCML).\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter she wrote to the Minister of Justice, Malami, the suspended NPA MD said the contractor connived with the consultant and lied to the NPA that work was done. She also lied to the minister that no key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done.\n\nThe letter dated June 5, 2018 and received by the ministry on June 8, 2018 was signed by I.G. Umar, Assistant General Manager, Board, for NPA Managing Director.\n\nThe letter was titled \u2018Re: Execution Summary of the Entire Argument Surrounding the Calabar Channel Management Contract at the Truth Verifiably Documentary Evidence\u2019.\n\nPart of Usman\u2019s letter to Malami read: \u201cThe committee found amongst others; that the Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer (two key officers) who should be involved in the dredging exercise denied that any dredging activities took place within the period claimed by Niger Global, the ship movement of the dredgers MV Atlantico, MV Hurricane and MV Waterway could not be substantiated by the Calabar port, the pre and post comparison of the depth of the channel with a survey carried out six months before the dredging exercise revealed that the alleged dredging of the areas of the channel was questionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this same consultant is having a valid contact with the NPA and it is the same consultant that is confirming work of both Bonny and Lagos channel managements and the same MD is making payment to these companies on the basis of confirmation of work by the same consultant she\u2019s accusing of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe second big lie she told the minister is that no any key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nBut the report of the committee shows that Port Hydrographer, a key officer of the NPA, was a member of the technical committee and signed under a report which confirmed that work was done.\n\nA letter from the Nigerian Navy dated July 2017 with ref VT: 015/73/200/Vol.IV/70, made available to SaharaReporters also showed the suspended NPA MD was hiding the true state of things.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Managing Director, Calabar Channel Management Company, was titled, \u2018Provision of Security Services to the Dredging Company for Calabar Channel for the period 20 November, 2014 to 15 January, 2015\u2019.\n\nIt says, \u201cThis is to confirm that the Nigerian Navy through NNS VICTORY Calabar provided all the security services to the personnel and equipment of Calabar Channel Management Company for the successful execution of dredging exercise. The operation was hitch-free based on our assessment hence there was no security breach during the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment, nobody including the minister (Amaechi) and the President is aware of the true outcome of that committee report because she refused to let them have a copy of the report and she only keeps telling them and Nigerians that the committee report indicted the contractor.\n\n\u201cShe has granted many interviews in which she told lies about the whole contract. She\u2019s a pathological liar and always knows how to get away with all this. Her arrogance and disregard for working ethics have cost Nigeria a lot and still cost Nigeria hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. She is the reason why Calabar Port has not been dredged and Lagos ports decongested,\u201d added one of the sources.\n\nDocuments by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Channel_Committee Review Signed Copy by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Port Update Post Privatization Monitoring by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nJoint Confirmatory Survey by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "text": "The Niger State government says it has arrested some of the bandits who abducted students of the Salihu Tanko Islamiyyan School, Tegina in the Rafi Local Government Area of the state.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how gunmen on Sunday stormed the police station in the town and went round shooting sporadically into the air to scare residents before breaking into the private school where they abducted over 100 children attending Islamic lectures.\n\nThe school, which consists of nursery and primary arms, also hosts Islamiyya students in the evening and at weekends.\n\nTegina is the hometown of the local government chairperson, Isma\u2019il Moddibo. It is in the same local government area with Kagara where bandits earlier this year abducted many students but later released them after negotiation with the state government. See Also Insecurity Bandits Vowed To Kill 156 Kidnapped Islamic Schoolchildren If We Miss Ransom Deadline\u2013 Headmaster\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, deputy governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso said \u201csome of the bandits are in our custody.\u201d\n\nKetso, who didn\u2019t state the number of bandits arrested, also said security agents were already on the trail of the rest of the bandits with a view to rescuing the children.\n\nThe deputy governor, however, ruled out payment of any ransom but assured that the abducted children would be rescued the same way the Kagara Science College boys were rescued.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pay ransom to abductors. We are trying to negotiate to see how we can bring them back safely.\n\n\u201cBut first of all, we are trying to get in touch with the parents of those abducted because some of them came from other states to acquire the Islamic education. The government does not know their parents or where they came from.\n\n\u201cWe are still taking the census of the children to know the exact number that were actually abducted. Nevertheless, the government will do everything possible to ensure their safe rescue,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Sawari Ventures is leading investments in North Africa",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nBefore co-founding Almentor, Ihab Fikry wore three hats. He was a management professor, author of bestsellers on management (mainly in Arabic) and a multinational expatriate at companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil.\n\nThen he decided to quit it all to start sharing his knowledge via different mediums \u2013 television, newspapers, and YouTube.\n\nWhile he was doing this, he saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community until May 2015 when the news of Microsoft acquiring Lynda.com for $1.5 billion caught his attention. He spent the next 12 months learning about video-based learning. He was certain there was a business case for the video content he was putting out on YouTube.\n\nIn June 2016, he partnered with co-founders who worked for Google, Microsoft and other multinationals to start Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa. They started with a seed round of $3.5m.\n\nThe initial plan was to generate $10,000 in sales just to validate the business idea but they ended up making $300,000 in sales that year.\n\nIn 2019, they crossed the $1 million revenue line and raised the next funding round \u2013 Series A. Almentor\u2019s Series A round was led by Sawari ventures.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of Ask an Investor I talk to one of the oldest venture capital firms in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Sawari Ventures.\n\nFikry pointed out that Sawari Ventures helped Almentor in three critical areas: Governance, networking with the ecosystem and technical support.\n\nSawari Ventures helped them put structures that enable the company to last for decades. It also helped with meeting relevant people in the ecosystem and provided good technical support and advice.\n\nI talk to Tamer Azer, a principal at Sawari Ventures; he joined the firm in 2019. One of the first things he pointed out to me early in our initial email exchange was that he had done an Ask an Investor series before. His own version was a free-flowing conversation with people interested in learning about how investors make decisions and the differences between concepts like equity and convertible notes.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Tell me about Sawari Ventures\n\nTamer Azer: Sawari ventures has been around since 2010. It was founded by three partners \u2013 Ahmed El Alfi, Hany Al-Sonbaty and Wael Amin. They\u2019re also the founders of Flat6Labs \u2013 the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator. Sawari Ventures is also a limited partner in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. We invest in companies anywhere from a million to $3 million per ticket and up to $5 million for the life of the company, across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. We\u2019re fairly sector-agnostic. We most definitely look for companies who have a very clear product-market fit and are doing something really innovative and meaningful.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the premise behind the investments you make?\n\nTA: There\u2019s an argument to be made that the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt became a lot more attractive after the Arab Spring when a lot of people found their sense of purpose and sense of independence.\n\nIt\u2019s picking up a lot from there. A lot of people saw it as a way to express themselves in a way to be able to engage on their own terms. There\u2019s an argument that a lot of people make that\u2019s connected somehow. In terms of the investment thesis, we\u2019re definitely sector-agnostic. We look out for companies that really have unique intellectual property. I\u2019m not just talking about documentation. The company has to be doing something really defensible and really unique. It can be doing something that we all know and love, but in a way that nobody else has done. Obviously, teams factor in a huge way. We\u2019re looking for professionally mature people who work with intention, who are coachable, who understand why, what and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\nDA: How do you find these companies or better still how do people get your attention?\n\nTA: I made a decision when I first started working in this industry to respond to absolutely everybody. I respond to anyone who messages me on LinkedIn, anyone who emails me. I try to put myself out there a lot and speak at events and do articles like the one I\u2019m doing with you right now, so that people hear about me and they try to reach out to me. Deal sourcing is always two ways.\n\nSometimes it takes me longer than I\u2019d like to admit, but I do try my best to respond to absolutely everyone.\n\nDA: That\u2019s really generous. If you get more popular you\u2019ll probably need to get an assistant. So does Sawari invest in cohorts?\n\nTA: We\u2019re not an accelerator. These are types of activities that Flat6Labs would organize. For us, we look for companies that are a bit more mature than that.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the relationship between Flat6Labs and Sawari ventures?\n\nTA: The founders of Sawari Ventures and the founders and Flat6labs are the same. When Sawari Ventures raised its North Africa fund, we invested in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. There\u2019s something really important here I need to point out between when a company joins Flat6Labs and when it can join Sawari Ventures. There has to be a bit of a gap, where they go out into the world and raise their middle round.\n\nJust because you get into Flat6Labs does not mean that once you graduate you\u2019re going to get money from Sawari Ventures automatically. We look out for whoever survives, manages to go out into the world, get a seed fund, grow their business even more, and then they can come to Sawari for their Series A round.\n\nDA: What does support from Sawari Ventures look like?\n\nTA: Typically, one of the partners of the firm would sit on the board. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our companies in the beginning to build a strong relationship and to build a strong plan for the business. Moving forward, we work very closely with them to help with business development, growth, as well as fundraising. We work with them to analyze the data that they share with us and help them make data-driven decisions. Obviously, we deploy our entire network to support their growth.\n\nThese are how most VCs support the portfolio companies. We\u2019re also in a position where we have some very strong limited partners who are interested in co-investing. We have a really wide network that allows us to bring a lot of international VCs into the next rounds for the companies. For instance, we brought in Partec to co-invest with us in MoneyFellows.\n\nDA: How does due diligence happen and how long does it take?\n\nTA: Each company will have a different level of preparedness, investment readiness, and every company will have different rounds. A priced round will have a very different timeline than a convertible note round or a safe round. So ultimately, every process is fluid depending on the nature of the round and the co-investors in the round and the lead.\n\nWe will always want to be the lead on any investment that we make and we\u2019re always trying to bring co-investors into the process. We definitely conduct four layers of due diligence. There\u2019s commercial, financial, legal, and tech.\n\nThe rest happen a little later in the process. Initially, there has to be a good solid commercial due diligence, so we can buy into the market, the team, the company, and then we take it forward from there.\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nTA: One that comes to mind is coachability. I\u2019m turned off when I see that a founder or co-founders are not really being responsive to feedback from an investor or a customer. When they have a reputation for being not just defensive, but being uncoachable. That\u2019s a major red flag because when you invest in someone, the relationship is very close for a very long period of time. If you can\u2019t give and take, then it becomes really tricky to nurture this relationship over that period of time. Another thing I really look for as a red flag is co-founder dynamics. Are they both at the pitch? How do they talk during the pitch? How do they answer questions? What does the dynamic and the relationship between them look like? If it looks out of sync, that\u2019s a pretty major red flag.\n\nDA: You said Sawari Ventures typically takes the lead on investments. Why the emphasis on this?\n\nTA: We also co-lead. As regards the times we lead investment rounds, it\u2019s because of the environment. Many companies in this region find investors who can\u2019t and won\u2019t lead, who will tell them, find the lead and we\u2019ll follow. It\u2019s part of a fund ethos that we like to lead our own investments because we really believe in them. Another reason is the market dynamics in the region, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to follow on, but not lead, which ultimately leaves you in a strong position when you are capable and willing.\n\nWe\u2019re a very experienced team. We have very clear intentions about what we like to invest in and why we invest in certain things.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits and M&A?\n\nTA: I think the African market, we\u2019re all suffering from a lack of exits. We all have that problem. Angel investors all over the continent are just dying for an exit because they\u2019ve been investing for years and years. We\u2019re all really dying for exits but exits are really a function of foreign direct investment. It\u2019s a function of mature stock exchanges. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more and more exits from North Africa. We have seen a few and they\u2019re getting bigger, but we still need so many more before more capital comes into North Africa and that capital gets redeployed.\n\nYou know how it works, you have a company and you exit, all of a sudden you\u2019re an angel investor. Then you\u2019re a fund manager or you start another company that people want to invest in quickly because you already have a successful exit. We\u2019re seeing the industry in North Africa mature, and it\u2019s heading more and more towards some of these interesting exits. We\u2019re starting to see bigger rounds. We\u2019re starting to see exits, we\u2019re starting to see mergers in the continent, in North Africa and in Egypt especially because it\u2019s the market that I\u2019m closest to. We are seeing a lot of maturity, a lot of growth. For example, a lot of ex-Uber and ex-Careem staff are starting companies that have been doing fantastically well. As more and more of these things happen, the maturity of the entrepreneurs and investors grows, and exits will come. We just have to keep at it.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup?\n\nTA: VC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime, They have a 10 year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\nJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time, and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\nWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing checks, we have to get the money to be able to write these checks first.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these checks. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\n\nDA: What are some trends you\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\nTA: I think for me, the main trends are the fact that people are starting to solve deep-rooted fundamental problems. They\u2019re starting to solve access to finance. They\u2019re starting to solve financial literacy and financial inclusion. They\u2019re starting to solve healthcare problems. People are actually tackling the big-ticket issues that were previously left to the public sector. We\u2019re seeing the market respond very positively to that.\n\nDA: Any final words?\n\nTA: It\u2019d be interesting to see more engagement from large institutional investors with investing in startups. There\u2019s immense potential and having your local financial institutions support you as a fund manager helps immensely when it comes to getting international development. It\u2019s a team effort, we have to do it together.\n\nI\u2019m encouraging more engagement from African financial institutions, not just banks but hedge funds, insurance companies and pension plans.",

          "title": "For Rising Tide Africa, more African women should build diversified investment portfolios",
          "text": "Rising Tide Africa wants more women to be bolder at investment tables, to dream bigger and ask for more money to do bigger things. As told to me by Co- founder, Yemi Keri and Founding member, Ivana Osagie.\n\nWhen Ivana Osagie first started investing in startups, it was not entirely to make money for herself but out of a shared passion to help small businesses gain ground.\n\nThis meant that her investment efforts were without any knowledge of how things should work. So she did things without a proper framework, like weighing and diversifying her risks as well as evaluating her opportunities.\n\nBefore she could come to terms with this defect, the entrepreneur she invested with had disappeared with her money and she lost everything.\n\nWhile sulking over her loss, she stumbled upon angel investing and realised that it was what she needed to build her portfolio. Angels flock together for a reason,\u201d Osagie tells me on our Google call. \u201cBy investing alongside others, you get to diversify your risks to some extent, bringing certain expertise to the table. When you combine that with the expertise of other people, then you have a fuller picture of a startup.\u201d\n\nToday, Ivana is a founding member of Rising Tide Africa, an investment network that consists of a group of female angel investors harnessing their power, passion and capital to positively impact and actively create a new Africa.\n\nIvana Osagie: Founding member, Rising Tide Africa.\n\nWhat exactly does Rising Tide Africa do?\n\nFunded by private investors only, Rising Tide Africa was founded in 2016 by Co-founders Yemi Keri and Ndidi Nnoli- Edozien as a trans-border women-oriented investment network that engages in educating women to become angel investors. They do this through activities such as mentoring, networking and ultimately, offering opportunities for women to build a diversified portfolio of investments.\n\nRising Tide believes that it will bring about positive change by investing in the continent\u2019s exciting startups and next generation to create a new Africa.\n\nOsagie said that apart from investing money, they are also involved in other routines that aid the growth of the startups in their portfolio.\n\nWith every investing procedure comes other packages that involve mentoring and networking. She is of the opinion that investing isn\u2019t just about capitalism. \u201cWhen entrepreneurs come on board, we find that many times they\u2019re not investment-ready. So we need to work with them to get them investment-ready.\u201d\n\nThis process includes mentoring by industry experts and sharing a network of contacts.\n\nThis network of female investors has a mentoring team that works with founders to build business models, develop business plans and get a proper hold on the businesses. \u201cIt could be about helping them personally, for instance, learning how to communicate, how to stand in front of investors and convince them of the viability of the solution,\u201d she tells me.\n\nMuch talk about women empowerment\n\nAlthough the VC firm invests in female lead and gender diverse teams predominantly, there is a reason for this.\n\nIn the last decade, Africa has seen a massive explosion in the business sector, especially for tech-enabled startups. Early-stage companies and SMEs now exist in an exciting technology economy that is fast sprouting a lot of opportunities for business owners on the continent. But in all of these, there is still a limited opportunity pipeline for women.\n\nWhen it comes to access to finance, amongst other things, reports still prove that women aren\u2019t participating as much.\n\nGlobally, women\u2019s access to finance is disproportionately low. In 2017, according to this report, 65% of women had a financial account compared with 72% of men. Fast forward to 2021, not much has changed. In trying to determine what could still be the reason behind this, according to a World Bank report, the gap between men and women in developing economies remains unchanged since 2011, at 9 percentage points.\n\nOnly 37% of women have a bank account in Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2017, compared with 48% of men with bank accounts.\n\nThe African Development Bank revealed that there is a $42 billion gender gap in access to finance. In Nigeria, for example, an estimated 50% of the population lives in extreme poverty and financial exclusion for women is only 36%. In bridging this gap, more organisations and startups are leaning towards gender balance in their operations.\n\nThat\u2019s not really a pretty sight, is it?\n\nThese reasons and more formed the foundation of Rising Tide Africa.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be able to paint a different landscape. We wanted women to come to the table, to be bolder, to dream bigger dreams, and to ask for more money to do bigger things because we know that women have the capacity to do so. We might just need a bit of support. So that\u2019s why we set about building an angel network that comprises women so that we can open up space for more women,\u201d Ivana says.\n\nShe believes that by giving women agency, \u201cwe\u2019re actually building a bigger and stronger community and ensuring better outcomes for everybody; men, women and children inclusive.\n\nInvestment opportunity pipeline for startups\n\nApart from investing solely in female-led companies, Rising Tide looks out for all kinds of tech-enabled startups. Co-founder Yemi Keri says leveraging technology will keep the startups flexible and scalable as well as give them a sustainable model. \u201cThere are multiple revenue models for startups that leverage technology.\u201d\n\nYemi says Rising Tide always looks forward to exits so as to plug funds into other businesses that come on board. Ultimately, their goal is to create a an avenue for more African women to build diversified investment portfolios.",

          "text": "As CEO of Lori Systems, Uche Ogboi will bear some of the weight of African logistics on her shoulders.\n\nWhen Lori Systems started operations in Kenya in 2016, Uche Ogboi was nearing the end of an eventful eight-year career as an investment banker at Citi.\n\nShe had led the multinational bank\u2019s fund for small businesses and helped deploy billions of dollars for projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.\n\nA year later, Lori would be the star startup at TechCrunch\u2019s first-ever Battlefield Africa competition, winning $25,000. One of the judges at the event was Eghosa Omoigui, the founding partner at EchoVC Partners, a Nigerian venture capital firm. Ogboi had joined EchoVC as an associate principal, closing deals and helping the firm\u2019s portfolio companies figure out operations.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, first met Ogboi in 2017. When they met again in 2019, Ogboi was now principal at EchoVC and led in the VC firm\u2019s investment in Lori\u2019s Series A round.\n\nHer due diligence process impressed Sandler who was looking out for someone to bring structure and help scale the logistics startup\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cShe was so incredibly structured and process-driven,\u201d Sandler says to TechCabal in a joint interview with Ogboi.\n\n\u201cShe understood what we were doing and pushed us in new directions. Lori needed her.\u201d\n\nJoining Lori and multitasking\n\nOgboi joined Lori as Chief Operations Officer (COO) in July 2019, four months before the Series A raise was announced. But in her first few months at Lori, Ogboi had to do more than be COO to immerse herself in the thorny business of logistics in Africa.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t functionally do the role until over a year in. I started by experiencing almost every role in the business because that was needed,\u201d she says.\n\nUche Ogboi. Image credit: Lori Systems.\n\nShe was on the field managing cargo departures and overseeing transportation. For a time, she filled in as the startup\u2019s chief financial officer and general manager for their operations in East and West Africa.\n\n\u201cThat experience has allowed me to work very closely and empathize with every part of the team, as well as with customers and transporters. I have seen the business from all sides.\u201d\n\nThis boots-on-the-ground experience of the business helped her understand logistics pain points. It clarified how technology will ultimately drive solutions that relieve those pains.\n\n\u201cFor our investors and stakeholders, I know and understand what it takes to scale Lori to become a multi-billion-dollar company on the continent.\u201d\n\nDeploying to Nigeria and saving costs\n\nOne of Lori\u2019s goals is to help clients save cost by up to 20%. While they have historically achieved that, Sandler credits Ogboi for some transformations that have happened since 2019.\n\nUntil Ogboi joined, the startup was largely an East African company in two Kenyan cities (Nairobi and Mombasa) and Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Sandler ran the company with Jean-Claude Homawoo, as co-founder and chief product officer.\n\nAs part of her first task, Ogboi scaled Lori\u2019s official expansion to Nigeria in the second half of that year. In doing so, she increased competition in Nigeria\u2019s tech-enabled logistics sector which already included startups like Kobo360 and TradeDepot.\n\nAccording to Sandler, she grew the Nigerian business tenfold within that first year. In 2020, she kept the entire organisation lean when COVID-19 disrupted regular flow at borders, helping the company save 40% of costs and nearly doubling margins.\n\nBy mid-2020, Ogboi\u2019s actions in shaping Lori\u2019s adjustment to the pandemic led Sandler to have deeper thoughts about the startup\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw Uche in action, it became even more clear that as Lori continues to grow, she should be the person at the helm of this organisation,\u201d Sandler says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a quick decision but by December, conversations became more serious, setting a succession plan in motion that would lead to her appointment as CEO, with effect from July 1, 2021.\n\nA rare CEO leading an African first-mover\n\nSandler, a South African, will become Lori\u2019s Executive Chairman while Ogboi takes the wheel as the startup\u2019s visionary.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, will become Executive Chairman\n\nShe hopes to lean into her ten-year \u201ccocktail of experiences\u201d from investment banking through venture capital to drive Lori\u2019s mission of being the platform that makes every node in the logistics value chain efficient, thereby lowering haulage costs in Africa.\n\nSome factors like poor road infrastructure and policy inconsistencies will be out of her control.\n\nAs of 2018, the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index ranked Kenya 68th, Uganda 102nd and Nigeria 110th out of 160 countries.\n\nBut Ogboi\u2019s main anchor for changing the space \u2013 the focus of her leadership at Lori \u2013 will be further exploring the power of digital technology for logistics. At the moment, Lori provides clients with real-time information on goods and trucking assets through web-based apps.\n\nSo what\u2019s next on their technology roadmap: Internet of Things? Augmented Reality for warehousing? Blockchain for trucking?\n\nLogistics-tech companies like Lori may not solve Lagos traffic or build roads in Kampala. But they hope to exert influence through technology.\n\nOgboi does not give specifics. But she says they are working on some things over the next few months that will help them \u201cscale much quicker.\u201d\n\nOn one hand, it should be inevitable that someone as experienced should lead a mission as big. In reality, Ogboi is one of only a handful of female tech CEOs in Africa. She takes a deep breath and acknowledges the sad reality but knows she is in a position to drive more women up the ladder in other tech startups but especially at Lori.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has recovered from 2020\u2019s shock. It is back to its pre-COVID growth rates of 20% month over month. Last November, they received an undisclosed investment and signed a partnership agreement with Imperial Logistics, a global logistics company.\n\nSandler is confident that Ogboi will increase Lori\u2019s partnerships and relationships. Under his leadership, Lori helped move cargo worth billions of dollars; he looks forward to trillions with Ogboi in charge.\n\nNo pressure, huh?\n\nFor the new CEO \u2013 a mother of two daughters \u2013 it has been tradition to wake in the middle of the night to think about Lori. Now she\u2019ll probably sleep even less with the weight of African logistics on her shoulders. I prod and poke for what her first announcement will be. Convivial but coy, she only volunteers a general sign: \u201cwatch this space.\u201d",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Here's a look at how the suspension affected the country's mobile subscriptions. pic.twitter.com/TdPYGSNAgM \u2014 Intelligence by Techpoint (@TechpointIntel) June 1, 2021\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria had 190 million mobile subscribers, but that number hit 192 million in March 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian government banned the sale and registration of new SIM cards and introduced a December 30 deadline for people to link their National Identity Number (NIN) with their SIM cards.\n\nIn retrospect, it is not clear if the government considered the risks of COVID-19, as that move coincided with a sharp increase in positive cases in the following months.\n\nMTN and Airtel\u2019s financial reports for Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 revealed that this policy would also hurt telecom companies. Both companies registered a reduction in subscriber numbers during the period in question.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s data all but confirms these numbers.\n\nIn November 2020, Nigeria had up to 207.9 mobile subscribers, but the country has witnessed a downward spiral since then, leading to the loss of over 15 million subscribers.\n\nCompared to previous years, this could be considered an abysmal showing.\n\nBy comparison, Nigeria gained 15.7 million subscribers between March 2019 and March 2020. From March 2018 to 2019, subscribers grew by a whopping 23 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NCC\u2019s subscriber numbers could perhaps be termed inflated, considering the data doesn\u2019t account for people holding multiple SIMs in different devices.\n\nConsequently, the actual number of mobile subscribers is much lower than what the NCC\u2019s records show. Though the regulator had plans to regularise the data in the past, nothing much came of them until the NIN order.\n\nThe subscriber decline in such a short time continues to raise questions about the size of Nigeria\u2019s addressable Internet market, as most of the lost subscribers are Internet users.\n\nPer the NCC, Nigeria lost 9.2 million Internet subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nWhile the data wars of 2019 and 2020 were particularly thrilling to observe, Nigerian telecom companies were on a losing streak in the three months between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nMTN was the hardest hit, with 3.8 million Internet subscribers lost. For context, MTN lost 4.8 million subscribers in total. This means about 70% of them were Internet subscribers.\n\nHistorically a formidable competitor to MTN in the data market, Airtel lost about 3.5 million Internet users. This is about 67% of the subscribers it lost in total.\n\nGlo fared way better than the first two, losing 1.3 million Internet subscribers, about 68% of the total mobile users it lost.\n\nSIM ban or not, 9mobile has struggled with the loss of its subscribers in recent years. However, it lost the least number of Internet subscribers at a respectable 701k.\n\nHowever, this number gets weird considering that it lost just 132k mobile subscribers. This would mean about 569 9mobile subscribers went offline during this period.\n\nThe loss of Internet subscribers by Nigerian telcos is also telling considering that, due to the pandemic, more people needed to be online to attend to their businesses, jobs, or education, but the SIM ban period might have been a stumbling block.\n\nThankfully, the ban has been lifted even though the NIN registrations continue.",

Continuing the company\u2019s vision would be its co-founder and Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Akindele Phillips.\n\nAkumah reveals that he will be stepping back from actively running Farmcrowdy to focus fully on his other company, Nigerian mobility startup, Plentywaka. Akindele will then be tasked to continue the company\u2019s vision to deepen technology in Nigeria\u2019s agricultural sector.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Onyeka Akumah (CEO), Akindele Phillips (CRO), Temitope Omotolani, Christopher Abiodun, and Ifeanyi Anazodo, Farmcrowdy started with a premise to finance small scale farmers across Nigeria.\n\nSince then, Akumah has led the company through significant milestones which include closing $2.4m in equity investments, raising $20m for its network of over 440k farmers, acquiring Best Foods, and exiting Crowdyvest through an acquisition, a company it piloted in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were initially looking at raising money, but we put a pause on it for now as we made something substantial from the sale of Crowdyvest.\n\nAkumah says the transition will be a gradual one, and he\u2019ll be there to assist the new CEO as needed.\n\nMeet Akindele Phillips\n\nL-R: Onyeka Akumah, Akindele Phillips\n\nPhillips, who takes the reins of one of Nigeria\u2019s most prominent startups, will be drawing from his experience as a risk officer in some of the world\u2019s most reputable companies.\n\nPhillips, who holds a Bsc in Accounting from Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), worked as a Credit Risk Officer at Zenith Bank in 2009.\n\nHe then spent three years, between 2010 and 2013, as a Senior Audit Associate at Big Four consulting firm, KPMG.\n\nBefore founding Farmcrowdy with Akumah, Phillips was already flexing his entrepreneurial muscles as a Strategy Director with logistics company, Philandmove, and Managing Partner of financial consulting firm, Porter\u2019s World Consult.\n\n\u201cMy experience with risk and audit in such reputable companies and even here at Farmcrowdy will definitely be a plus as business, especially one like ours, involves a lot of risk,\u201d Phillips says.\n\nFollowing the company\u2019s evolution over the years, Phillips says his plan is to amplify the work that is already being done at the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does the business look like?\n\nFollowing a conversation with Techpoint Africa in November 2020, Farmcrowdy has fully transitioned from the consumer facing platform (B2C) model it operated with its crowdfunding platform, to a business to business (B2B) and a Business to Government (B2G) model.\n\nRather than crowdsource funding from different individuals and have farmers pay up to 20% to 30% interest rates, Phillips reveals that the company is working with Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) to provide funding for farmers across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe loan interest rates for these institutions are mostly in single digits, and this would give farmers more capital to fully run their businesses,\u201d Phillips explains.\n\nThe company is also working with the Central Bank of Nigeria, and both Akumah and Phillips attest that the banking regulator has been very supportive of its endeavours and has partnered on some projects.\n\nA possible expansion\n\nAkumah reveals that the company has also hired a Country Manager to aid its expansion to East Africa, but it hasn\u2019t revealed the exact country it would be expanding to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also looking to hire a Country Manager in the Caribbeans as that is another region we\u2019re looking at expanding to,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Akumah?\n\nAkumah explains that he will keep focusing on three sectors that he is most passionate about; Agriculture, Transportation, and Real Estate.\n\nAkumah is currently running the Techstars backed Plentywaka and might be looking to spread his entrepreneurial tentacles even further.",

          "text": "Today, June 1, 2021, TalentQL is launching Pipeline by TalentQL, a specialised training programme for software engineers in Africa.\n\nDuring an interview with Techpoint Africa in November 2020, Adewale Yusuf, TalentQL CEO, revealed that Pipeline had been in the works since the company\u2019s inception. He discussed plans to launch the talent pipeline programme for training and upskilling junior developers in the first or second quarter of 2021.\n\nHowever, unlike the previous plan to focus on junior developers, this programme is focused on training and upskilling mid-level software engineers across the continent to senior software engineers.\n\nPipeline is Africa\u2019s first senior engineers\u2019 incubation programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrica suffers a dearth of senior software engineers. According to the IFC-Google report 2020, the continent has nearly 700,000 professional developers, but the ratio of junior developers to senior developers is quite disproportionate.\n\nThis narrative is not new to the African tech ecosystem as Andela \u2014 formerly a talent accelerator, now a talent outsourcing company \u2014 laid off 420 junior developers in 2019. The underlying thread behind this decision was the search for more senior developers to join its ranks.\n\nDuring our chat with Yusuf, he said, \u201cThe demand for senior engineers is at an all-time high. Up to 90% of our clients are seeking senior engineers. [But] most of the senior software engineers didn\u2019t pass our international clients\u2019 tests. So that\u2019s why we have to upskill them. Africa has enough junior engineers but not [enough] seniors.\u201d\n\nHe cites the largely self-taught developers littering the landscape, who \u201cdidn\u2019t train in a more structured environment,\u201d as the reason for this large skill gap. According to him, our education system doesn\u2019t prepare developers for the global stage.\n\nThis idea might not be far from the truth, as the IFC-Google report states that 31% of African developers are self-taught.\n\nAs Yusuf says, while there\u2019s a need to give African talents an opportunity, \u201cyou need more talent in the market to give opportunities.\u201d Hence the launch of this program.\n\nThe programme follows the Lambda School\u2019s model of a pay-later scheme, with participants not required to pay until they\u2019ve found the next opportunity after completing the programme.\n\nLambda\u2019s Income Share Agreements (ISAs) have come under severe scrutiny, with three students recently suing the for-profit company for issues relating to the contract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we do not have the details of TalentQL\u2019s proposed arrangement, Yusuf believes the programme is sustainable, and its team of highly experienced professionals can handle whatever is thrown at it.\n\nPipeline will be entirely remote and will run a peer-to-peer learning format offering one-on-one mentorship provided by top senior software engineers working in some of the biggest tech companies globally, including Twitter, Tesla, GitLab, Amazon, and Google.\n\nThis model is different from the programme\u2019s initial model, which would have had a campus at Ile-Ife, Osun State. It seems plans for this campus have been put on hold for now.\n\nThe intensive six-month programme will not only focus on tech skills but \u201cwill also cover soft skills that are needed to compete in the global market.\u201d\n\nThese skills \u2014 team skills, client/user skills, and sales/interview skills, among others \u2014 are quite important in a software developer\u2019s journey to becoming a senior software engineer.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, \u201cWhat differentiates a mid-level developer from a senior developer is not just the technical skills but exposure to challenging projects, soft skills, and the right mentorship.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IFC\u2019s report, a minimum experience level of six years is required to be labelled a senior software engineer.\n\nYusuf says that TalentQL is accepting only the best intermediate-level engineers, thus closing the gap with a minimum requirement of three years experience.\n\nRegistration begins today, and there is a vetting process to ensure that only qualified candidates get into the programme.",

          "text": "Nigeria can productively engage about 60 percent of its under-utilised pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity and cut importation of pharmaceutical products by at least 25 percent with the adoption of contract manufacturing (outsourcing), industry analysts and stakeholders have said, making a case for growth.\n\nContract manufacturing is one of the strategies emerging market peers have adopted to own a significant share of global pharmaceutical production, by servicing the rising need for outsourcing different aspects of production.\n\nChina, India, Singapore, South Korea and even Malaysia have become an attractive hub for giant pharmaceutical firms looking to have others manage the business of up-scaling their backend for large volumes of production and stay price competitive.\n\nThis played a significant part in placing Asian manufacturers as the second-leading exporter of drugs and medicines in 2019 with 9.5 percent of the global total, despite European countries controlling over 80 percent.\n\nTaking on these roles has given these manufacturers an edge in a highly contested marketplace such that India, for instance, now answers as the largest producer of vaccines in the world.\n\nAnalysts think the contracting manufacturing strategies hold huge growth potential for Nigeria to make a bold statement on the world map, considering the opportunities inherent in collaborations with corporations of repute for quality standards.\n\nAs of 2017, Nigeria\u2019s drug manufacturing industry only catered to a quarter of the local demand, with the remaining three quarters handled by Asian manufacturers\u2019 exports to Nigeria.\n\nThis implies as much as 70 percent of marketed drugs by about 130 pharmaceutical firms were imported.\n\nIt is a growing concern that the Nigerian Representatives of Overseas Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (NIROPHARM) say the country may not be rid of it and shies away from opportunities such as contract manufacturing.\n\nThe group in a position report provided to BusinessDay stated that some of the goals outlined in the Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan to make Nigeria a top hub in West Africa and an ideal supplier of low and medium technology consumer and industrial goods could materialise with the contracting approach in a pharmaceutical market expected to worth $4 billion by 2026, according to McKinsey\u2019s projections.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is that instead of banning the importation, why don\u2019t you allow these local companies that have the capacity to work with the international firms raise their standards, and with that take on the volume that is being imported,\u201d Omongiade Ehighebolo, director, communications, Government Affairs and Global Health \u2013 Africa at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).\n\nDifferent from regular manufacturing companies that are neck-deep in all operations of production, contract manufacturing organisations are based on the client\u2019s specific designs, formulas and specifications.\n\nWhile some clients request for active ingredient manufacturing, for example, others simply want solid dosage produced to their specifications.\n\nSome of the drivers of growth in Nigeria currently include demand for generic compositions to reduce the rising cost of healthcare increased collaborations with pharmaceutical firms overseas, availability of production facilities, and regional trade integration across Africa.\n\nNIROPHARM sees this as a growth area that the government can pursue strongly to position Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector better on the continent.\n\nCountries across Africa are bending towards generic drugs, which have sustained double-digit market share at the expense of over-the-counter and branded products.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have higher capacity utilisation; your cost of manufacturing will drop and make the product. If a Fidson is trying to compete for export of a drug within the AfCFTA to Senegal, the average doctor will still want to buy a GSK product for trust. But if you present a product that is in partnership with GSK, the trust will extend to this product and position Nigeria better,\u201d Ehighebolo said.",

The virus has changed the way we live and interact with one another globally.\n\n\u201cIt is heartwarming today that we continue with our gradual return to our normal lives with the commencement of the second dose coronavirus vaccination. With this, we hope for brighter days ahead as we collectively fight to defeat the virus.\n\n\u201cThe second dose vaccination exercise commences today, June 1, and will last for 40 days, during which period we intend to get the vaccines to our people, including frontline workers who are 18 years and above across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the State.\n\nObaseki said the second dose is a booster dose which will provide full protection against the coronavirus disease, adding: \u201cThe flag off is important to create awareness in the state and boost public confidence in the safety and efficiency of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cI took the first dose. Despite all the fears expressed, nothing happened. I am here today to flag off the second dose vaccination. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t take my second dose today because the time scheduled for me is not due. I will be due for the second dose on the 12th of June. However, some people have earlier dates. That is why the programme is launched today. I will take my second dose on the 12th of June and you will be invited to know the importance of the vaccination.\u201d\n\nNoting that the vaccines will be rolled out in phases, he said: \u201cThe first phase is now being administered to frontline workers, strategic leaders and the elderly; as scheduled for them. The second and third phase will follow and the rest of the eligible population will take turns to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the goal of his administration is to vaccinate about 70 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not been vaccinated, it is important to take the vaccine because by the end of June, it might be almost impossible to travel around the world without a vaccination certificate.\n\n\u201cGovernment alone can\u2019t fix this pandemic. We must all play our part by adhering to COVID 19 protocol to enable us to protect our loved ones, even after taking the second dose of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki seized the opportunity to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for his support and role played in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that different stakeholders, particularly development partners, worked in synergy with the Edo State Government in ridding the state of the virus.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have vaccinated 38,500 people in the first phase of the first dose vaccination exercise. We are expecting that 38,500 people will come forward for their second dose. It is only then that you will have full immunization.\u201d\n\n...",

Fr. Fidelis Arhedo made the call while delivering a keynote address to audience at an event organized by the body in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State, to commemorate the 2021 Child Protection Day.\n\nHe described Child Protection as the safeguarding of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, adding that Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Right of the child provides for the protection of children in and out of schools and places of worship.\n\nThe clergyman also emphasized the need for leaders in the community to be supportive of children and families, just as he asked employers to provide family-friendly work environment.\n\nHe blamed lack of parenting skills, drug and alcohol use, poor parent-child relationship, difficulties in managing anger and stress, personal health issues, including low self-confidence, among others for the prevalence of child abuse in the society.\n\nRev. Fr. Arhedo consequently admonished parents to discipline their children thoughtfully, teach children their rights, invest in kids and implored people to endeavour to report any case of child abuse to relevant agencies for prosecution.\n\nSpeaking on the the theme of the 2021 Child Protection Day, \u201cThe Role of Parents and Caregivers in the Protection of Children, the Coordinator of the Edo State Child Protection Network, Barr. Stella Obehi Ojeme said it was the right of every child to be protected.\n\nHe listed the types of Child Abuse to include Physical, Emotional and Sexual Abuses, asserting that abusing a child constituted the worst thing anybody could do to a child.\n\n\u201d It is the right of children to be protected. When you protect children, you are not doing them a favour. It is the duty of everyone to protect children because we are all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cNot putting a child in school is another form of child abuse. Every child deserve to be well treated. Discrimination against children is yet another form of abuse\u201d, she said.\n\nParticipants at the event were secondary students from the five local government areas of Edo Central Senatorial Districts, parents, teachers, security agents, civil society groups, among others.\n\n...",

          "title": "Asaba Declaration: Crossing the threshold of gullibility and division",
          "text": "By Obunike Nwosu\n\nOn May 11, 2021, Governors of the 17 states of Southern Nigeria met in Asaba, Delta State and resolved to ban the horrendous and anachronistic open grazing of cattle throughout their territory. They also called for the devolution of powers and for national dialogue to reset the country\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIt is a landmark that all Southern Governors could meet and take a uniform stand on national matters and have been supported by their National Assembly members, regardless of political party. The resolution has been widely endorsed in the North as well. Congratulations to all the participants and, in particular, to the Chairman of the Forum, Chief \u2018Rotimi Akeredolu, S. A. N., Governor of Ondo State, who has always demonstrated a rare strength of character.\n\nThe jinx has been broken but the journey to a united front has only begun. Southern leaders must now demonstrate that they are not as selfish, gullible and easily browbeaten as thought.\n\nWithout standing together, Southern Nigeria cannot muster the bargaining power to drag the country out of the path to perdition, in order to develop it (which should be the preferred option) or to secede from it (which may become inevitable) \u2013 despite the excellence of her people in the academia, the professions, public service, science and technology, commerce and industry, literature, music and the rest of the arts as well as sports and everything that makes the society tick, all around the competitive world.\n\nIn that case, the country would continue in crisis and in decline, their citizens will be stuck in the mess, their growth would remain arrested and they would remain second class citizens in the country they contribute the most to build, for whatever it is yet worth. Nigeria\u2019s redemptive potential for the black race would also be totally wasted. Therefore, this breakthrough should never be allowed to fizzle.\n\nBe it known, too, that the unity of Southern Nigeria is dreaded by the conservative Fulani-led Moslem North, who are set in their views about the rest of Nigeria as subordinate and have been in control of state power (directly or indirectly) by divide-and-rule tactics, since independence. In word and in action, they remain committed to the complete conquest and subjugation of Nigerians, begun by Jihad in the 19th Century, which the current leadership \u2013 knowingly or by default \u2013 has been facilitating.\n\nBut a people could be conquered only if they could be kept divided, as Southern Nigeria has perennially been. Thus, they are bound to resist the emergent Southern unity and would deploy blackmail, bullying, baits (including 2023) diplomacy and all sorts of wit to annul it.\n\nAlready, you can see the reprobate, self-righteous, master \u2013 servant, indignation of the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Malam Abubakar Malami, S. A. N., to the resolution \u2013 as if they are more patriotic than the Governors and as if the Governors have no knowledge of the law. Mallam Garba Shehu (a spokesman of the Presidency) went further to deploy a purported memorandum of the Minister of Agriculture, on the reactivation of grazing reserves and routes, to override the resolution of 17 Governors. What an affront and an insult!\n\nIt does not matter to them that the 17 Governors represent the half of Nigeria\u2019s population as well as the territory from which the revenue for running the country is derived. The deluge of blood and tears, flowing in the land, purportedly, for the sake of cows, does not move them. For all they care, you may die or relocate provided the primitive practice of nomadic herding is sustained, as Femi Adesina, another spokesman of the Presidency was once sent to advocate! It could mean that the herdsmen (who do not own the cows) are armed and sent on a mission and that the cows are baits.\n\nCuriously, the Secret Service and the Armed Forces and the Police, who are swift in smoking out EndSARS benefactors, IPOB and ESN members and camps and in extra-judicially torturing and killing suspects, have been incapable of locating the cells of the marauding herdsmen, bandits and kidnappers, not to talk of arresting and dislodging them from occupied communities and forests for restoration to the owners. As long as the President condones the atrocities \u2013 expressly or by body language \u2013 the Armed Forces and the Police will never move against them, regardless of platitudes. The Nigerian Armed Forces and the Police have more been slaves of the Head of State than defenders of the people, from inception.\n\nWhen the Federal Government has failed to act but, rather, is bent on seizing land (that is highly limited) in Southern Nigeria for Fulani settlements, for the sake of the same herdsmen, through the obnoxious Water Resources Bill, Rural Grazing Areas (RUGA) Grazing Reserves and Routes as well as the Nigerian Livestock Transformation Plan, e. t. c (while sidelining the clean solution of ranching in the North) who would not understand that a game is going on? What option did the Governors have under their limited powers than the Asaba Resolution? Or, should they simply watch their territory overrun?\n\nSince there cannot be a national Armed Forces and Police, Secret Service, Judiciary, Legislature and Civil Service (other than ones servile to the Head of State and his people) only the Aburi Accord of 1967 (or a confederation) can truly stabilize Nigeria. Under the Aburi Accord, for example, almost everything \u2013 from Resource Control to Agriculture, Education, Highways, Power generation and the Armed Forces and the Police \u2013 would be regionalized. Are Hisbah, Amotekun, Ebube Agu and Eastern Security Network (ESN) not pointing to the inevitability of the Aburi Accord?\n\nNigeria is a natural federate country. As a federation of regions in the 1960s, it was doing so well, socio-economically, that it was acclaimed as the future leader of the black race \u2013 until derailed by the greed of domination. Next, a confederation (Aburi Accord) was agreed in 1967 but was repudiated before implementation, which precipitated the Civil War of 1967 \u2013 1970, followed by other deviant behaviors and the obnoxious, predatory, Constitution of 1999 largely responsible for the current mess. The Governors are only affirming the call of the rest of Nigeria for true federalism and devolution of powers.\n\nBe it known that unless this Constitution and the supremacy mindset can be dispensed with and the Aburi Accord (or, at least, the structure for the socio-economic performance of the First Republic) is restored \u2013 so that everybody can breathe, can be weighed on the same scale and can substantially self-actualize \u2013 Nigeria is bound to suffocate to death, despite all the sentiment to the contrary. Instead of artificially sticking together and die, let us naturally move apart and prosper, as Ojukwu advocated at Aburi.\n\nOtherwise, an Oduduwa or a Biafran nation had better fill Nigeria\u2019s destiny in the world. Imagine that Biafra had survived. It would have become an industrial cum military complex comparable to Israel, South Korea, Turkey, India and China. All that Oduduwa or Biafra needs to do is to take money and rascality away from political office and enforce drastic laws against graft and nepotism \u2013 given that Africans, in general and Nigerians, in particular, have been incorrigible in the abuse of public office, whereas they serve their clubs, professional bodies and communities honorably, without pay. The remainder of Nigeria would be the better for Oduduwa or Biafra, given that prosperity is infectious \u2013 as was evident before the political crisis of the First Republic. The current system is unsustainable, by whatever means.\n\nObunike Nwosu wrote for Lekki, Lagos",

          "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said that the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria failed to address some critical national questions confronting the country, hence the resolve by the legislature to amend it.\n\nThe speaker also said that the constitution was not only the foundation of its existence but it\u2019s supposed to set the terms of the nationhood and define the manner that reflects her common truths and highest aspirations, noting that \u201cOur constitution falls short of this standard.\u201d\n\nHe said the reason for that was \u201cbecause the 1999 Constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise that we entered into two decades ago in order to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and that we returned to democratic government.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement from the speaker\u2019s office, Gbajabiamila spoke in Lagos while declaring open the public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution, saying the National Assembly could only achieve the task after getting the inputs and support of the citizens.\n\nParticipants at the 2-day public hearing included the deputy governor of Lagos State, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, who represented Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu; members of the House of Representatives Special Committee on the Review of the Constitution; members of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ); Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC); representatives of political parties, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), youth organisations and market women.\n\nThe speaker said though the current exercise is not the first of its kind, it might be the most important one in the nation\u2019s recent history as the decisions to be made would have far-reaching consequences for the future of Nigeria.\n\nIn response to the doubts expressed in some quarters about the exercise, the Speaker noted that there was no perfect constitution anywhere in the world, but that it was imperative for Nigeria to have a near-perfect constitution to enable the country to confront and resolve many of its political, economic and socio-cultural challenges.\n\nThe Speaker, therefore, urged Nigerians to participate fully in the ongoing process so that their inputs would be captured for the country to have a new direction, adding that they could not afford to miss the opportunity of addressing their challenges and sustaining their future at this critical moment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe assured Nigerians of the sincerity of purpose of the 9th National Assembly to deliver a reviewed constitution that everyone would be proud of.\n\nThe Speaker stated, \u201cThe foundational constitution of the United States of America deemed people of colour to be \u2018less than\u2019 and denied women the right to vote. It did not include any limits on the President\u2019s term of office and allowed for citizens to be denied the right to vote for failure to pay the \u2018poll tax\u2019. Twenty-seven reviews and amendments, over one hundred years cured these and other defects.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the task before us now is to use this process of review and amendment to devise for ourselves a constitution that resolves the issues of identity and political structure, of human rights and the administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else, that have fractured our nation and hindered our progress and prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur job is to produce a constitution that turns the page on our past, yet heeds its many painful lessons. It is not an easy task, but it is a necessary and urgent one.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cWe will not be able to deliver on this historic assignment if we restrict ourselves to tinkering around the edges of the constitution or by imposing upon ourselves artificial redlines that restrict honest conversation.\n\n\u201cAll of us in the House of Representatives will work conscientiously and in good faith so that it may be said of us in this process that we made an audacious attempt at creating for our nation a constitution that recognises our diversity and draws strength from it, and addresses once and for all, the fault lines that distract from nation-building.\n\n\u201cIt is all too clear that many of our citizens have come to expect too little of our politics and government. We are suffering from the tyranny of low expectations and the cynicism that causes us to believe that the political process cannot produce anything worthy or worthwhile.\n\n\u201cI understand the causes of this cynicism, but I refuse to share in it. I still believe that politics and government in Nigeria can be a force for good and that by our common endeavour we can achieve the vision of a just, peaceful, and prosperous society.\n\n\u201cHowever, beyond these Public Hearings, you still have an opportunity to make submissions that will be considered and that will help this process achieve the best outcomes. Please, by all means, participate. Let your voice be heard, and let your vision also inform the direction of this process.\n\n\u201cI urge all who have come to participate here today to do so with decorum and respect for one another. Let our deliberations be well-intentioned, well informed and reflect our patriotism. In this way, we will have a most productive engagement over the next two days.\u201d\n\nIn his goodwill message, Governor Sanwo-Olu through his deputy, Hamzat, said the need for a special status for Lagos State in the constitution could not be overemphasised.\n\nThe governor said being the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria, whatever affects the State has the capacity to affect the entire country, hence the need for a special status.\n\nHe also urged members of the National Assembly to prioritise fiscal federalism, local government autonomy, in addition to state police in the ongoing review process.",

She, however, ruled out plans to pay ransom to the criminals.\n\n\u201cGovernment is on the pursuit of the bandits and efforts are being put in place to identify them.\n\n\u201cThe number of the kidnapped school children is not fully ascertained, however, efforts by security agencies to secure their release has been intensified.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pay ransom to abductors.

Bauchi state recommend that appropriate legal frameworks be put in place to allay the fears of likely abuse of the state police by state governors.\n\n\u201cIn order to address this unjust and unfair treatment, we as a state and a people, know, we have the respect and sympathy for corporate Nigerians, Katagum state should be created out of Bauchi, and additional LGs should also, be created so that we can be at par with other states that are having more LGs than us,\u201d Yayale noted.\n\nThe elder statesman also agitated for constitutional role for traditional rulers saying, \u201cas custodians of our culture and traditions, they have not been recognized by the 1999 constitution.\u201d\n\nHe said that traditional rulers have been involved in the maintenance of law and order in their respective domains adding that \u201ctraditional rulers have the capacity to help the government in her quest to foster development because when colonial masters came, they used them to rule indirectly,\u201d decrying that the traditional institution has been left to suffer redundancy despite their strategic role in their respective domains.\n\nChairman, House of Representatives committee on review of the Constitution, Bauchi zone, Aminu Sulaiman in his earlier remarks noted said areas that needs attention in the review of the 1999 constitution includes, defence and security, land use act, unity of Nigeria, devolution of power, derivation and revenue sharing, state police, local governments autonomy, role of traditional rulers among others.\n\nHe commended the support of Governor Bala Mohammed to the committee which he said will go a long way in ensuring success of the assignment.\n\nThe speaker, Bauchi State House of Assembly\n\ncommends the national assembly for taking the bull by the horns to alter the constitution.\n\nHe noted that people are aware that the constitution needs to be altered, assuring that houses of assembly members across the country will give them all the needed support.\n\nStates and Local Governments agitated for are, Katagum from old Bauchi, Savanah from old Borno State, Bura LG from old Ningi in Bauchi State, Fune LG from old Jajere and a new Jajere local government in Yobe State.\n\nMembers of the Committee are Dr Aminu Suleiman representing Fagge constituency, Kano, who is the Chairman, Auwal Jatau Mohammed from Bauchi, Afe Oberuakpefe from Delta, Olatunbosun Olajide Boladele from Oyo and Bio Omar Mohammed from Kwara State.",

          "text": "PHILIP CLEMENT, ABUJA\n\nThe minister for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, says the federal government is looking beyond budgetary allocations to finance critical infrastructure development in the country.\n\nMrs Ahmed who also doubles as Vice-Chair of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP) said this at the recently held webinar on financing public-private partnership (PPP) to boost infrastructure delivery in Nigeria.\n\nShe stated that according to the Nigerian Integrated Infrastructure Masterplan (NIIMP) and Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP:2017-2020), Nigeria would require the sum of $3 trillion over the next 30 years to bridge the yawning gap.\n\nA review of the federal budgets over the past few years as well as the amount allocated for capital expenditure in each of these years clearly shows that the government\u2019s resources are insufficient for bridging the infrastructure gap in the country.\n\nOne such viable option, according to her, is the adoption of PPP arrangements that could enable Nigeria to access significant resources from both local and international investors for investment in Infrastructure.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding this, we have not been able to fully unlock the potentially huge benefits afforded by PPPs, due to the absence of a comprehensive PPP framework setting out institutional responsibilities, which would provide investors with the necessary comfort to commit capital towards infrastructure development,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPlease recall that the federal government took the significant a step towards addressing this through a policy pronouncement in the form of circular number SGF .50/S.37/II/749) dated 14th September 2020.\n\nThe circular provides the much-needed clarity on federal government institutional roles for PPP arrangements.\n\nThe circular stated that the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the federal government agency tasked with implementing the government\u2019s privatisation programme, as the secretariat to the NCP, shall be responsible for the concession of public enterprises and infrastructure already listed in the first and second schedules of the Public Enterprises Act.\n\nThe circular equally stipulates that the BPE shall act on behalf of the federal government as the counterparty on all infrastructure projects being developed on a PPP basis while the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) continues to act as the regulatory agency for PPP transactions with powers to inspect, supervise and monitor the projects and processes to ensure compliance with relevant laws, policies and regulations.\n\nAccording to Mrs Ahmed, it is expected that the new policy direction would remove all forms of ambiguity or concerns, and therefore stimulate investors interests in the country\u2019s infrastructure market.\n\n\u201cAs you may be aware, some other initiatives are being taken by government in the PPPs space such as the ongoing review of the guidelines on viability gap funding, and management of contingent liability that has both reached advanced stages.\n\nIn addition, from the 2021/2022 budget cycle, all infrastructure projects must be screened for PPP suitability and compliance with National Integrated Infrastructure Master plan by the Federal Ministry of Finance Budget and National Planning and BPE before inclusion in the national budget and subsequent procurement.",

          "text": "By Taiwo Okanlawon\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has approved the recruitment of 500 health workers to fill the gap in the health sector across the state.\n\nAccording to the governor, the challenge of under-staffing in the public health sector in the state is something the administration has been trying to address, noting that ongoing intervention to build at least one well-equipped Primary Health Care Centre in each of the 351 Wards of the state is on course.\n\nMakinde in a statement by his press secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, stated these in Saki, during a Town Hall meeting in commemoration of the second anniversary of the government, held at the Saki Parapo Town Hall, Saki.\n\nThe statement added that the governor equally flagged off the reconstruction of the 45.3 kilometre Saki-Ogbooro-Igboho Road, stating that his administration\u2019s commitment to building roads that target the economy of Oyo State has led to the massive ongoing infrastructure projects in the state.\n\nThe road project, which according to the governor, is expected to be completed in 18 months, was awarded to Messrs China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) at the cost of N8.7 billion under the Alternative Project Funding Approach.\n\nWhile speaking at the Town Hall meeting, which was attended by traditional rulers, artisanal groups, politicians, youths, people living with disabilities and students from Saki and neighbouring towns in Oke Ogun, Governor Makinde said his administration has listened to the yearnings of the people and would continue to address them accordingly.\n\nResponding to the views expressed by representatives of communities and groups, Makinde reassured the physically-challenged that he would continue to hold their interest dearly.\n\nHe said: \u201cSome of the things you requested for, I have started with those who are physically-challenged. I said I will appoint some of you as Supervisory Councillors in the interim administration at the local level and in what we plan to do too, your position is guaranteed.\n\n\u201cWhat you just need to do is not to allow anyone choose for you but choose them yourselves and that request too is granted.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on the issue of shortage of workers in the health sector, particularly the Saki Specialist Hospital, Governor Makinde said his government would address the problem once and for all.\n\n\u201cI heard what they said about Saki Specialist Hospital. It is a problem we are trying to solve throughout Oyo State. As big as this State is, we only have one hundred and thirty-six (136) doctors. In Primary Health Care Center, we have only seventeen (17) Doctors.\n\n\u201cLast week, I already signed that they should recruit 500 health workers. So, when the recruitment is done, it will reach Saki and its environs. on Thursday, we will commission the road coming from Moniya to Iseyin. I have called the person in charge of NYSC and was told that they have about 48 medical personnel and about 38 Doctors. I have told them not to post them to anywhere, and that we would post them to our various hospitals.\n\n\u201cSo, please, just be patient a little bit with us.

So, we will do the rest. We are fixing them one after the other.\n\n\u201cWhen I entered Saki today, I could not see dust cover the places and houses where it used to, because roads have been fixed. The contractor has assured us that he will complete the road in six weeks; but with the request the Kabiyesi made, which is extending the road by another 1.2km, we will also grant it.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Dr. Wasiu Olatubosun said the Town Hall meeting was held to gauge the feelings of Oyo State residents on the performance of the administration and see what other areas it would need to address.\n\nThe event was aired live on three radio stations, with opportunities to call into the Town Hall meeting by listeners at home.",

It is supposed to set the terms of our nationhood and define who we are in a manner that reflects both our common truths and highest aspirations.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur constitution falls short of this standard because the 1999 Constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise that we entered into two decades ago in other to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and that we returned to democratic government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was always the intention that we will one day as one people and one nation, return to amend this document so that it gives voice to the yearnings of the Nigerian people and sets out in clear details how we intend to achieve the shared ambitions of our nationhood. Providence has cast upon the 9th National Assembly the responsibility to write such a constitution for the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThough he acknowledged that amending the constitution will be difficult, the Speaker stated that it is a work that must be completed in order to improve Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, the task before us now is to use this process of review and amendment to devise for ourselves a constitution that resolves the issues of identity and political structure, of human rights and the administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else, that have fractured our nation and hindered our progress and prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur job is to produce a constitution that turns the page on our past, yet heeds its many painful lessons. It is not an easy task, but it is a necessary and urgent one.\n\nGbajabiamila added that a constitution review will offer the opportunity to \u201crestructure our government to make it more effective\u201d and will \u201cput an end to the debilitating conflicts that even now continue to tear our nation apart\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will do what is necessary to achieve these outcomes because all of us in the House of Representatives recognize that this moment in our history is fraught with promise and peril, and the future of our country lies in our hands,\u201d he said while calling on participants at the public hearing to make meaningful contributions.",

Paschal Oluchukwu, expressed disappointment that \u201cdespite earlier signs and premeditations including an alleged audio voice note widely circulated on the Social media which alerted on the plan to launch a fresh offensive on our defenseless citizens, the Ebonyi state government took no action to protect and defend the victims of this recent onslaught.\n\n\u201cWe are greatly pained that helpless and hapless women, children and youths were cut in their prime in a dastard carnage that spanned for some hours while their victims were deep in their sleep.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, medical and health-care workers in various parts of the State are offering treatments to scores of victims who sustained varying degrees of injuries during the attack. They have also been calls for ebullient citizens to provide clothing and other essential materials to the victims many of who are stranded in the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, AE-FUTHA, Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cOur anxiety over this sadly depressing attacks is made worse by the fact that the State\u2019s Chief Security Officer, Engr. David Umahi on whose shoulders hugely lie the constitutional burden of protection of lives and properties of our beloved citizens has largely down-played all sensible and reasonable warnings about the activities of killer herdsmen.\n\nWhile condemning the massacre in Ebonyi communities, the group decried and questioned the conducts and activities of the men operating under the EbubeAgu Security network, saying \u201cthe outfit has remained what we had feared- a deliberate, willful and willing tool in the hands of the state government to hunt down, hound and maim members of the opposition- PDP and other voices.\n\n\u201cRather than seek practical and viable solutions that can quell the growing unrests and attacks on our people, AESID wishes to reiterate that Umahi is so deeply stuck in his 2023 politics that he is rather empowering and emboldening the \u2018bad guys\u2019 to attack and kill those he considers his opponents.\n\n\u201cThis group consequently condemn the claim that the attack took place in Benue State and the attempt by the State government to further downplay or trivialize not only the latest attack on Izhi communities but the entire security affairs in our dear State. The silence of the Speaker and political class in Izhi land, nay Ebonyi State and their inability to condemn these attack including the desperation of Umahi and his cahoots in security circles to always exonerate the provocative Fulani herdsmen from blames where and whenever they occur in Ebonyi demands thorough probe by International security bodies.\u201d\n\nAESID however, called on the state government to change tactics in addressing insecurity in Ebonyi state.\n\n\u201cUnless perhaps he changes style and strategy on his current grandstanding and unbridled politicization of the security of lives and property of our people, AESID will continue to dump the blames of the killings of our people by marauding herders on the doorsteps of the Governor just as he continues to pay more attention and interest to his shadow-chasing 2023 political projections and campaigns!\u201d",

All the people who want power, whoever they are, you wonder what they really want. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time.\u201d\n\nWhile recalling that hat he visited all the 36 states of the country before the 2019 general elections, Buhari said: \u201cMajority of the people believed me, and the election proved it.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: No Third Term Agenda, Elections Will Hold \u2013 Buhari\n\nHe promised to continue leading the country in accordance with constitutional provisions, adding that those misbehaving in certain parts of the country were obviously too young to know the travails and loss of lives that attended the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nHe added, \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand. We are going to be very hard sooner than later.\u201d\n\nThe President said the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police have been changed, \u201cand we will demand security from them.\u201d\n\nOn the dangers posed to future elections by the burning of INEC facilities, President Buhari said he would give the electoral commission all it needed to operate, \u201cso that no one would say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We\u2019ll meet all INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the INEC Chairman said that so far, there have been 42 cases of attacks on INEC offices nationwide, since the last General Election.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe 42 incidents so far occurred in 14 states of the Federation for a variety of reasons\u2026.Most of the attacks happened in the last seven months, and they are unrelated to protest against previous elections.\n\n\u201cFrom the pattern and frequency of the most recent attacks, they appear to be targeted at future elections.

It did not include any limits on the President\u2019s term of office and allowed for citizens to be denied the right to vote for failure to pay the \u2018poll tax\u2019. Twenty-seven reviews and amendments, over one hundred years cured these and other defects.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the task before us now is to use this process of review and amendment to devise for ourselves a constitution that resolves the issues of identity and political structure, of human rights and the administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else, that have fractured our nation and hindered our progress and prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur job is to produce a constitution that turns the page on our past, yet heeds its many painful lessons. It is not an easy task, but it is a necessary and urgent one.\u201d",

No fewer than 42 persons were reported killed in separate attacks in two local councils of Benue State in May 28.\n\nThe attacks took place in Katsina-Ala and Gwer West local councils of the state, leaving residents of the communities in despair and some others seeking refuge at IDP camps.\n\n\ufeff\n\nResidents in the affected communities of Shikaan, Mbagena, and Kpav said the attackers suspected to be Fulani herdsmen invaded their communities in the early hours of Thursday and started killing people.\n\nThe deputy governor said Nigeria\u2019s security situation has gotten worse and he needs to address the country, rather than issue press statements through media aides.\n\n\u201cGarba Shehu is not the President of the country, he is only an appointee.

There must be zero tolerance for all those bent on destroying our country by promoting crime and insurrection!\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker have all been included in Gareth Southgate\u2019s 26-man England squad for the upcoming European Championships.\n\nMason Greenwood, Ben Godfrey, Jesse Lingard, Aaron Ramsdale, James Ward-Prowse, Ollie Watkins, Ben White have all missed out on the final list having originally made the 33-man provisional squad named by Southgate last week.\n\nAn underlying problem saw Greenwood ruled out of the Euros earlier on Tuesday, while despite injury concerns for Jordan Henderson, Harry Maguire and Kalvin Phillips, the trio have all made the final squad.\n\n\u201cThe most complex part this time has been those injuries, whether we should take the chance on people,\u201d Southgate said after the announcement.\n\n\u201cIn Jordan Henderson and Harry Maguire we\u2019ve got a couple of players who are not where they\u2019d be ideally in terms of their physical preparation, but we think the experience they have and the fact we think we can get them to a point where they can have an involvement in the tournament, it\u2019s worth taking them. Especially as we\u2019ve got an extended squad of 26.\u201d\n\nThe inclusion of four right-backs in the provisional 33-man squad last week had led to seven days of speculation regarding which player or players might miss out.\n\nSouthgate had highlighted the quartet\u2019s versatility last week when stating \u201cI see good footballers\u201d, suggesting Alexander-Arnold could play in midfield, with James, Trippier and Walker capable of playing in various defensive roles.\n\nAs a result, all four players have made the final list which features 10 defenders and just five midfielders, including 17-year-old Jude Bellingham.\n\nBukayo Saka and Jack Grealish are among the eight forwards in the squad, with the latter set to wear the No.7 shirt at the tournament.\n\nEngland play Austria in a warm-up fixture on Wednesday at the Riverside, and then host Romania at Middlesbrough\u2019s stadium on Sunday \u2013 a week before their Euros campaign begins against Croatia at Wembley on June 13.\n\nScotland will be England\u2019s second Group D opponents on June 18, followed by Czech Republic on June 22. The winner of the group will face the runners-up from Group F, which features France, Germany, Hungary and Portugal.\n\nSouthgate added: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking any tourists here. We\u2019ve got a squad, all of whom are ready to play and contribute. That\u2019s really important because over the next nine matches we hope to be involved in, we\u2019re going to need everybody.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult thing is that when we get to the first game we can only pick a squad of 23 on matchday, it\u2019s hard enough to pick 11. Potentially we could be disappointing people on those matchdays, although we might not have everybody available.\n\n\u201cThe pros are that we\u2019ve been able to take a chance on players that we may have had to rule out. We have been able to cover ourselves in different positions, different tactical formations. [With] the professionalism of the group and the respect the group have for each other, I don\u2019t think the 26 is as big an issue as it might have been.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s 26-man squad for Euro 2020:\n\nGoalkeepers: Dean Henderson (Manchester United), Sam Johnstone (West Brom), Jordan Pickford (Everton).\n\nDefenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Ben Chilwell (Chelsea), Conor Coady (Wolves), Reece James (Chelsea), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa), Luke Shaw (Manchester United), John Stones (Manchester City), Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid), Kyle Walker (Manchester City).\n\nMidfielders: Jude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Mason Mount (Chelsea), Kalvin Phillips (Leeds), Declan Rice (West Ham).\n\nForwards: Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton), Phil Foden (Man City), Jack Grealish (Aston Villa), Harry Kane (Tottenham), Marcus Rashford (Manchester United), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund), Raheem Sterling (Man City).",
