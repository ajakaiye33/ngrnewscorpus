          "title": "ENERGY CRISIS: NLNG, NGA, others lament oil theft, as price of LPG rises further",
          "text": "By Udeme Akpan\n\nTHE Managing Director/CEO, Nigeria LNG Limited, Dr. Philip Mshelbila has cautioned against pipeline vandalism, oil theft, illegal refining and illegal bunkering as the energy crisis worsens in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nSpeaking as a panelist at the just-concluded Nigeria Oil and Gas, NOG, Local Content Conference 2022, in Abuja, Mshelbila, said: \u201cWe have people who are participating in this activity, masquerading as though this is a community problem, and pretending to be immature modular refineries. That is not the case, this is criminality, outright criminality, and it needs to be dealt with as such.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe NLNG boss, who described these vices as major challenges facing the oil and gas industry, said: \u201cThis problem is gradually strangling our industry, and if we don\u2019t fix it, it is the parasite that is going to kill its host.\u201d\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Managing Director, Shell Nigeria Gas and President, Nigerian Gas Association, Mr. E.D. Ubong, stressed that although the country has made progress, it is currently experiencing gas scarcity, leading to the high cost of the product.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cEvery sector you look at, export is the same story, that is the reality of where we are today. There is not enough gas for cooking, so the cooking gas price has gone up; there is not enough gas to fire the plants, so there is virtually no electricity. We are used to fuel scarcity, but we are also facing gas scarcity, and we all need to come together. There is a focused thing to do in the decade of gas, looking at how we are going to unlock it for the domestic market and for export.\n\nWe need to manufacture those cylinders; we need gas moving in the line of local demand and unlink it to export so that people can afford it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe session was targeted at identifying the challenges of effectively implementing gas policies, the strategies that must be in place to ensure the effective implementation of these gas policies, how the Nigerian energy industry can open opportunities with floating LNG in the face of growing global demand.\n\nOther members of the panel session, which was moderated by Olu Verheijen, Managing Director, Latimer Energy, included Ademola Adeyemi-Bero, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, First E&P; Abdulkabir M. Ahmed, Group Executive Director, Gas and Power, NNPC; Julius Rone, Group Managing Director, UTM Offshore, and Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the prices of petroleum products, especially diesel and cooking gas continue to rise, due to many factors, especially lack of domestic refining, massive importation and smuggling to other West African nations.\n\n\n\nIn Nigeria, hydrocarbon is currently extracted from 323 developed fields located in both onshore and offshore terrains. These fields, which either contain crude oil, condensates or natural gas reservoirs, are connected to 265 production processing stations, after which the stabilised oil and gas are exported via 31 export terminals.\n\n\n\nThe onshore processing infrastructure is linked to eight (8) crude oil/condensates and NGLs export terminals through pipelines that span 5,284 km. Some of these delivery pipelines connected to the five onshore export terminals are utilised by both the asset operators and third-party oil producers, for transportation, storage and lifting of crude oil blends through export or delivery to domestic refineries.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor and Sanni Onogu\n\nSenator Kashim Shettima is a former Governor of Borno State and a close associate of All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nHe has been a staunch supporter and campaigner for the choice of Tinubu as the next President of Nigeria.\n\nHe toured many states with Tinubu in December 2021 where he addressed party delegates and mobilised support for the former Governor of Lagos State.\n\nAs governor of Borno State between 2011 and 2019, the 56-year-old Kashim Ibrahim Shettima ran his government on the similar template used by Bola Tinubu in Lagos.\n\nDespite the Boko Haram insurgency, he was able to build world-class schools and housing and he also tapped on human resources outside his state.\n\nAmong his closest aides were an Igbo Christian from Anambra State in the Southeast, an Urhobo Christian from Delta State in the South-South, a Christian from Edo State in the Southsouth, a Yoruba Christian from the Southwest, a Fulani man from Gombe in the Northeast and a Hausa man from Zamfara State in the Northwest.\n\nHe was born on September 2, 1966 to the family of Sir Kashim Ibrahim. He is married to Nana Shettima, and they have three children: two females and a male.\n\nFrom a Wikipedia biography, Sen. Kashim attended Lamisula Primary School in Maiduguri from 1972 to 1978; Government Community Secondary School, Biu in southern part of Borno State from 1978 to 1980 and transferred to Government Science Secondary School, Potiskum (now in neighbouring Yobe State) where he completed his secondary education in 1983.\n\nHe studied at the University of Maiduguri and earned a Degree (BSc) in Agricultural Economics in 1989. He had his one-year compulsory membership of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC), at the defunct Nigerian Agricultural Cooperative Bank, Calabar, capital of Cross River State in South-South, Nigeria, from 1989 to 1990.\n\nHe obtained a master\u2019s degree (MSc) in Agricultural Economics in 1991 at the University of Ibadan in Southwest, Nigeria. Shettima joined the University of Maiduguri as a Lecturer with the Department of Agricultural Economics and was in the academia from 1991 to 1993.\n\nEarly career\n\nIn 1993, he moved into the banking sector and was employed by (now defunct) Commercial Bank of Africa Limited as head of accounts unit at the bank\u2019s office in Ikeja, Lagos State, Southwest, Nigeria.\n\nShettima was there from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 he crossed over to the African International Bank Limited as a Deputy Manager and rose to become a Manager in 2001. In 2001, he moved to the Zenith Bank as head of its main branch in Maiduguri.\n\nAt the Zenith Bank he rose to Senior Manager/Branch Head; Assistant General Manager (AGM)/Zonal Head (North-East), Deputy General Manager/Zonal Head (North-East) before he stepped out of the Zenith Bank as a General Manager in 2007 following his appointment as Commissioner for Finance in Borno State.\n\nShettima worked with the Commercial Bank of Africa as an Agricultural Economist at its Ikeja Office, Lagos State (1993-1997).\n\nHe then became a deputy manager, later manager, at the African International Bank Limited, Kaduna Branch (1997\u20132001), and was appointed Deputy Manager/Branch Head of the Zenith Bank\u2019s Maiduguri Office in 2001, becoming General Manager five years later.\n\nIn mid-2007, Shettima was appointed Commissioner of the Borno State Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. Later he became Commissioner in the Ministries of Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs, Education, Agriculture and later Health under his predecessor as Borno Governor Ali Modu Sheriff.\n\nPolitical career\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, he served as Commissioner in five Ministries. In the January 2011 ANPP primaries, Engineer Modu Fannami Gubio was selected as the candidate for the governorship. However, Gubio was later shot dead by gunmen, and Shettima was selected in a second primary in February 2011.\n\nIn the 26 April 2011 elections, Shettima won with 531,147 votes while the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Muhammed Goni, gained 450,140 votes. He won reelection in 2015 under the All Progressives Congress, APC and was unambiguously chosen as Chairman of the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum, an umbrella body of Governors in the 19 States located in northern Nigeria.\n\nHe has so far been driving key changes in the affairs of the forum with focus on promoting northern unity and reviving ailing industries belonging to northern states. As Governor of Borno State, he efficiently managed challenges arising from the Boko Haram insurgency which he inherited in 2011. With the approval of the National Security Adviser and the Nigerian Army in 2013, his government formalised establishment of youth volunteers called the Civilian JTF.\n\nSenator Kashim Shettima\u2019s leadership credentials have attracted positive recognition within and outside Nigeria. Governor Shettima emerged the 2014 Governor of the Year (Leadership Newspapers), Governor of the Year, 2015, (Nigeria Union of Journalists, national body); Governor of the Year, 2015 (NewsWatchTimes Newspapers); Governor of the Year, 2015 (Vanguard Newspapers); Governor of the Year, 2016 (Tell Magazine); 2017 Zik Prize for Leadership; Kaduna NUJ Award for courage and exceptional leadership (2017), FCT NUJ Merit Award for exceptional Leadership, 2017.\n\nIn February 2019 he became the winner of the Borno Central Senatorial District election, thereby replacing Senator Babakaka Bashir.",

          "text": "Mouthpiece of Northern Nigeria, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to brace up against security challenges.\n\nIt lamented Nigeria has come under the siege of bandits and terrorists with the current administration ineffective against insecurity.\n\nThe ACF led by the immediate past Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbe, said Nigerians will justifiably conclude that the Buhari led government is ineffective and needs to do more if they will ever be able to quell the crises.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Murtala Aliyu, ACF said though it counts itself among Buhari\u2019s ardent supporters and have always wished him well, Nigeria\u2019s rapid descent into strife, violence and lawlessness is getting to a point at which it can no longer afford to tell him only that which he wants to hear but what he needs to hear.\n\nThe ACF said: \u201cOver the past few months, the security crises we face in Nigeria has been deepening and there is a dangerous escalation of violence and bloodshed. Criminal gangs, heavily armed bandits, armed robbers, secessionist insurgents along with those that call themselves soldiers of so-called Caliphate, have laid siege to Nigeria. More so in the Northern states.\n\n\u201cThe highly coordinated attack on the Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital, Abuja, on the 5th of July, 2022, and the mass escape of hardened criminals many of whom are Boko Haram terrorists, have triggered an unprecedented wave of apprehension and panic among the long-suffering people, particularly of the North.\n\n\u201cComing around the time the advance convoy of Mr. President heading to Daura and long after the deadly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train on the 28th of March, 2022, in which many people were killed and a lot more kidnapped, the question on the lips of the public, is how and where will these crises, which are unprecedented in severity, leave us?\n\n\u201cWe noted that the response of President Muhammadu Buhari to the Kuje Prison tragedy in particular was to offer the familiar cocktail of platitudes, of sermons, condemnations and yet more sermons. As usual, the president asked the security services to \u2018investigate\u2019 the outbreak and find out what led to it. Presumably, in the view of the President, that was all that he was expected or required to do in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cAlthough we count ourselves amongst his ardent supporters and have always wished him well, Nigeria\u2019s rapid descent into strife, violence and lawlessness is getting to a point at which we can no longer afford to tell him only that which he wants to hear. We do need tell the president what he also needs to hear.\n\n\u201cWe simply are unable to find any courteous or less painful words to describe the feeling of utter frustration among the broad masses of Nigeria, especially in the North, arising from the ineffectual management of the security crises by the President.\n\n\u201cThe President in his Sallah message promised to deal with the situation before the end of his tenure. However, as long as the crises remains unabating, Nigerians will justifiably conclude that the government is ineffective and needs to do more if they will ever be able to quell the crises.\n\n\u201cProbably because President Buhari is unable or unwilling to hold his appointees responsible for any deterioration of the security situation and some other socioeconomic sectors under their watch, the vast amount of money and other resources being pumped into the security agencies have largely been ineffective.\n\n\u201cThe required boost in manpower and equipment, long recognized as the missing link in the current campaign, have remained largely unimplemented to the required level needed to secure the nation.\n\n\u201cIn other countries, the Kuje jail attack and similar ones that have happened in parts of Nigeria would have led to massive reshuffle, resignations and possibly prosecutions of officials that are negligent, incompetent or plainly untrustworthy.\n\n\u201cNo person other than the President has both the mandate and responsibility to ensure that the government of Nigeria maintains peace, security, order and good governance. We demand that President Buhari braces up without further delay and rise to today\u2019s occasion. The regime needs to reprioritize its programs and free more resources needed to end the pervasive insecurity that is bringing the country to its knees.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to tell the president what he needs to hear, which is that the patience of Nigerians is not limitless.\u201d",

          "text": "The Presidency has described certain impressions in a section of the media that Nigeria has fared worse under President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s watch as misleading, detailing key achievements of the administration in various sectors.\n\nA national daily, in its recent editorial, depicted the Buhari administration as having mismanaged the affairs of the country, leading it further deeper into failure and crises.\n\nHowever, in a rebuttal, by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, on Monday, the Presidency described any insinuation the administration had made the situation worse than it met it as pure fantasy, stating that the country now fares better than it was in 2015.\n\nAccording to the statement, in the three key pillars of focus for the administration, being, security, economy and the anti-corruption crusade, the Buhari administration has recorded recognisable footprints, the global crises that have marked the time lines in the last seven years notwithstanding.\n\nStarting with the efforts to better the security situation in the country, it noted that unlike in 2015, when it inherited a bizarre situation, where terrorists reportedly held territories in a part of the country, the administration has the turned the story around.\n\n\u201cThe authors are correct that Nigeria, like every other country in the world, is undergoing a period of hardship. But all and any suggestion that the Buhari administration is not leaving Nigeria in a better place than we found it \u2013 especially on the key pillars of the economy, security and corruption \u2013 is pure fantasy.\n\n\u201cThe facts speak for themselves. On security, as recently as 2015, Boko Haram held territory the size of Belgium in Nigeria. Today they hold no Nigerian territory to speak of. In March our military eliminated the leader of ISWAP in an airstrike using U.S. jets and British intelligence \u2013 testament to the newfound trust our allies hold in our administration, not enjoyed by previous administrations.\n\n\u201cMoreover, our administration is the only in Nigeria\u2019s history to implement a solution to the herder-farmer conflicts through our landmark National Livestock Transformation Plan. Already, where ranches have been established under that initiative, we are seeing a sharp reduction in disputes.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore incorrect to say nothing has changed, not to talk of getting worse.\n\nEven around the Daily Trust, things have improved. Seven years is a long time and their new managers may be unaware that in 2015, The Daily Trust needed barriers around their premises and heavy security- as did many other sensitive institutions- to be safe from terrorists. Now, they have all that removed, a clear indication that the threats, as they existed at that time, have abated,\u201d it argued.\n\nOn anti-corruption crusade, it noted: \u201cthis administration has seen hundreds of millions in stolen funds returned from abroad and used as social and welfare funds distributed directly to the poorest during the Covid-19 pandemic and the provision of long-delayed infrastructure-roads, bridges, rail, and power. This is a direct result of Buhari administration\u2019s initiatives such as our whistleblowing policy which empowers and emboldens Nigerians to report corruption without fear.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it again demonstrates the newfound trust our international partners have in Nigeria, thanks to the efforts of our administration. Those same partners refused to return stolen monies to previous administrations for decades, knowing it would simply be stolen again.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, what the Buhari administration has done is to place mechanisms to stop corruption from happening that include the strengthening of the office of the Auditor-General, enhancing the capabilities of the anti-corruption agencies by signing into law several legislations and Executive Orders; the implementation of the Treasury Single Account, TSA, whistleblower; the implementation of public expenditure management and forensic accounting management systems and several others.\u201d\n\nOn economy, it said: \u201cthe unprecedented and vast infrastructure development, driven by our administration, has set the country on course for sustainable \u2013 and crucially, equitable economic growth \u2013 while our policies for boosting domestic production of food and energy will be key to us navigating the global cost of living crisis.\n\n\u201cWith global supply chains disrupted by the Covid-19 lockdown and the Russia Ukraine war, skyrocketing freight rates and extreme weather events causing inflation to surge all over the world, leaders are getting the beating and we expect that ours will not also be spared.\n\n\u201cBut fairness demands that we should give credit to whom it is due. President Buhari put in place a food policy, to grow what we eat and eat what we grow, that has averted the growing food security threat that is pushing nations into a conundrum.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s program has given the nation the confidence to ban rice imports, saving a daily amount USD 5 million in Forex. We have seen rice Pyramids in many states, including Kebbi, FCT, Niger, Gombe and amazingly, Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cThe country has witnessed the setting up of 54 integrated rice mills, 1,000 small scale rice mills, and 57 fertilizer plants revived or built anew in a boost to production. Nasarawa State is today competing with Niger in sugar production and Kaduna State is about to commission a steel mill. Only a performing economy can give these.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest mistakes that opponents of President Buhari make, is to believe in their own preconceived perceptions and propaganda about the brand of politics they believe in.\n\n\u201cFor this President, one of the greatest investments a meaningful government can do is to better the lives of those at the lowest rung of the social ladder. This administration has more than 20 million persons benefiting from conditional cash transfers, school feeding and other social investment, SIP programs.\n\n\u201cIn a time of global hardship, we are faced with enough challenges without inventing them where there are none. Moreover, pretending that achievements do not exist where they do helps no one. Rather, let us focus on what we have achieved so that we may build further upon those achievements to tackle the new challenges that continue to arise.\n\n\u201cFinally, it needs to be said that in periods like this, when elections are within view, harsh and unfair criticisms are expected, especially against a leader like President Buhari with an image that is significant, in which the All Progressives Congress, APC invests heavily.\u201d",

Governor Shettima, in the history of Borno, is the only Governor that has sponsored the highest number of Christian Pilgrims every year since 2011.\n\n\u201cI am speaking boldly without fear or favour because as CAN Chairman I do not receive salary or kobo from the Government or any institution, but the facts need to be told. This governor has shown compassion to the Christian Community.\u201d\n\nAlso rejecting the Muslim/Muslim ticket, PDP presidential candidate Alhaji Atiku Abubakar said it is\u201ddivisive and exclusionist politics.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo, while our opponents might think that there is an easy road to victory in divisive politics, we must get the message across to them that Nigeria has seen the worst shade of exclusionist politics and the road ahead is the path of inclusive and unifying politics. That is what we stand for.\u201d\n\nHowever, a cleric, Rev. Father Oluoma, said: \u201cCrying over APC\u2019s candidates in the midst of other candidates questions our readiness to change the status quo or our capacity to make and accept informed decisions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one major reason behind the Muslim-muslim ticket by APC; electoral victory. Without a Muslim VP, the APC will lose significant votes from the North and probably lose the entire presidency. This is the fear and the reason for a Muslim VP. Don\u2019t let anyone beguile you to make it a religious problem, if you do, you will keep losing the big picture.\n\nI\u2019ll never reduce this issue to religious problem, it\u2019s more of political dexterity. APC chose electoral votes over religious sentiments. Of course APC knows a number of christians will be offended, but they still went ahead probably knowing that the mathematics of more votes favor them in this issue more than feelings.\u201d",

          "text": "From Desmond Mgboh, Kano Noah Ebije, Kaduna, Godwin Tsa, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe decision of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to adopt same religion ticket has continued to receive widespread knocks and commendation.\n\nTinubu, on Sunday in Daura, Katsina State, announced Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno and senator representing Borno Central Senatorial District as his running mate. While the APC presidential candidate is a Muslim from the South West, Shettima is a Muslim from the North East.\n\nTinubu said he decided to pick Shettima because he possessed one of the best credentials for the election.\n\n\u201cShettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all important electoral victory, but, also, step into the shoes of the Vice-President.\n\n\u201cAs a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character, and patriotism, he has my implicit confidence and faith.\u201d\n\nShettima\u2019s choice has been generating row in the nation\u2019s political discourse. A few hours after, two frontline members resigned from the party and Tinubu\u2019s campaign organisation in protest. However, while the Muslim-Muslim ticket has pitched a section of the Christian community against one another, it has also received commendation from governors, senate leadership among others.\n\nSenator Abbo, Bwala resign\n\nAnnouncing his resignation from Tinubu support group, Senator Ishaku Abbo, said it was irresponsible of former Lagos governor to take his political survival over the stability and peace of Nigeria.\n\nHe accused Tinubu of refusing to take a cue from the opposition against his vice-presidential ambition and how President Muhammadu Buhari opted for a Christian running mate in 2015 instead of the Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cBuhari fought a civil war and understands the consequences of a divided nation. When Tinubu wanted to be VP in 2015, Buhari said no because he understood the importance of unity,\u201d explained Mr Abbo.\n\nThe lawmaker explained how he met with a support group in Abuja in search of a running mate for Mr Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe sat down in Abuja and strategised, and we concluded that he should not take a Muslim as running mate. He (Tinubu) threw away the report. My conscience will not allow me to campaign for Tinubu. I am a member of CAN; I cannot deny CAN. I remain in APC. But I will take the survival of my country first over political considerations,\u201d he Abbo.\n\n\u201cWe cannot work for such a man. I will oppose (a) Christian-Christian ticket because I am invested in the stability of this country. A Christian-Christian ticket will be insensitive to Muslims of this country. The country is evenly divided among Muslims and Christians. So any government that is Muslim-Muslim will be illegitimate and will never gain the respect of Christians,\u201d Abbo said.\n\nAlso, Daniel Bwala, special adviser to the deputy senate president on legal matters, resigned his membership of the APC.\n\nHe said his decision is based on \u201cprinciples and conviction\u201d, adding that his resignation is effective Sunday, July 10.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cTonight I officially resigned my membership of @OfficialAPCNg on principles and conviction that I hold so dear. At this time of our national existence, our efforts and energy should gravitate towards uniting our people.\u201d\n\nBwala described the Muslim-Muslim ticket as an \u201cinteresting\u201d development in the now-deleted tweet.\n\nCAN, Arewa Christian group clash\n\nThe Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria described the Muslim-Muslim ticket as a monster against peace and unity of Nigeria. It also said same faith ticket breaches the Nigerian Federal character constitutional principle.\n\nIn a statement by the state chairman, Rev. Joseph Hayab, CAN alleged that the ruling party is bias in government and against some specific tribes in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe implication of such a decision is that such a candidate has no respect for the unity, peace and progress of Nigeria. It also suggests that the candidate is just a candidate that prioritises selfishness, greed and personal unhealthy interest over the good of the nation.\n\nBut the Northern Progressive Christian Alliance (NPCA), an interdenominational Christian forum known for promoting peaceful coexistence and religious tolerance with members across the 19 northern states, threw its weight behind the choice of Senator Shettima on ground of competence, performance and love for Christians during his days as Borno governor.\n\n\u201cIt is high time Nigerians rose above ethnic or religious sentiments in the consideration of choice of leaders at all level of governance\u201d.\n\nChristian group, which disclosed this in a statement jointly signed by the Chairman and Secretary; Reverend Moses Bwala Bitrus and Pastor Nicolas Abimaje and made available to journalists in Kaduna said the election of a president and his running mate as well as other political positions should not be measured on the basis of tribe, religious and regional interests, but on who can work and tackle the plethora of problems facing Nigeria.\n\nIt dismissed allegation that Senator Shettima created and has been sponsoring Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWe challenge those behind the allegations to provide evidence with an assurance that our group will mobilise Nigerians to reject him outrightly and if none, they should stop the campaign of calumny.\n\n\u201cWe know all the efforts he has done to rescue the Chibok girls and end Boko Haram insurgency at the risk of his life.\u201d\n\nMost formidable team \u2013 APC govs\n\nAPC Governors\u2019 Forum hailed the Tinubu-Shettima ticket as a formidable team.\n\nThe governors, who rose from a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in his Daura, Katsina State, country home, yesterday, said the ticket would ensure victory for the party in the 2023 presidential polls.\n\n\u201cWe are quite pleased that this formidable team of Tinubu and Shettima will usher in a new Nigeria in 2023,\u201d the forum\u2019s chairman and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, said.\n\nHe told reporters that \u201cKashim Shettima is one of Nigeria\u2019s finest who will bring his wealth of experience to bear in the governance of the nation. Nigerians should be convinced that, this is about the best team from the party for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cWe are proud and congratulated the President over the development especially with the manner the primaries held in the most transparent way leading to the emergence of Tinubu as the APC presidential flag bearer.\n\n\u201cThis team will no doubt complement the achievements and track records by Buhari in the past seven years especially with the different policies put in place to bring back the country from the effects of COVID-19 and that of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved to work hard for the victory of the APC in both the weekend Osun state governorship election and the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nSome of the other governors who attended the meeting included Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State, Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano, Hope Uzodimma of Imo, Ahmed El-Rufai of Kaduna, and Simon Lanlong of Plateau State.\n\nLawan, APC N/East caucus, Gbajabiamila hail\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan and North East caucus of the APC also hailed Shettima.\n\nLawan in a statement on behalf of the caucus in Abuja said Tinubu and the APC made an excellent choice in Shettima.\n\nLawan said Shettima\u2019s background in academics and the private sector prepared him for the achievements that he recorded as governor and in the senate.\n\nHe said the APC presidential running mate was a loyal and committed member of the party, adding that he possed what it took to be the vice president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nSimilarly, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, described it as a wise decision and a good combination that would lead to success at the polls for the APC.\n\nAccording to him, Shettima has over the years proved his mettle as a shrewd and progressive politician whose eight years as governor of Borno State was a defining moment for the state.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju is widely known as the biggest talent hunter in the country who has over the years assembled an army of performers in governance irrespective of their ethnicity or religious leaning. This unique feature also can be found in Sen. Shettima following his track record of excellence in both the private and public sectors,\u201d the speaker stated.\n\nMajor plus, says Omo-Agege\n\nSenator Ovie Omo-Agege, in a congratulatory message personally signed, Senator Omo-Agege described the APC Vice Presidential candidate as detribalised and visionary, and a major plus for the APC Presidential ticket.\n\nHe recalled how the lawmaker representing Borno Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, played a key role in his own emergence as Deputy Senate President in 2019.\n\n\u201cHe was and continues to be a major player, not only in the National Assembly but in our nation at large. He is a large hearted and forward looking leader, inclusive in perspective and shorn of all bigotry. Our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, couldn\u2019t have made a better choice.\n\nHe\u2019s competent \u2013 Ganduje\n\nKano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, in a statement by the commissioner for information, Muhammad Garba, described Shetima as quick-witted and prepared for the office of the vice president.\n\nThe governor commended Tinubu for making a choice in Shetima, and described the combination as an assurance for the success of the party at the polls.\n\nGanduje called on Nigerians and particularly members of the APC to rally round its presidential candidate and his running mate to ensure its success.\n\nWhy Tinubu is correct -SAN\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Oba Maduabuchi, SAN, has explained that Tinubu was compelled by the existing political circumstances of the country in picking a fellow Muslim as his running mate.\n\nHe said politics and political successes in an election are controlled by votes and not religious sentiments.\n\n\u201cThis is because, in political decisions, it is the interest that reigns supreme. What is your interest? What is your objective and not what your religion or sentiments are.\n\n\u201cEverything a candidate in an election is seeking are votes. If he comes to your church or mosque, he is coming there to campaign for votes.\n\n\u201cSo, if Tinubu, being a southern Muslim, decides to pick a Christian from the North as his running mate, he may lose the election because the north is predominantly Muslim.\n\n\u201cIf you exclude the northern Muslims in the electoral equation, how many votes do you think he will get from the north?\n\n\u201cSo, it is the circumstances of Nigerian polity that made it compelling that he must pick a northern Muslim as running mate,\u201d he said.\n\nMaduabuchi said that people who are criticising Tinubu for picking a fellow Muslim as his running mate are indirectly campaigning for him because of what is called sympathy of numbers.\n\n\u201cOnce you begin to criticise Tinubu that he is running a Muslim-Muslim ticket, you are making the Muslims in the north to bond together and it will now become like a war between the Christians and Muslims.\n\n\u201cAnd if 60 per cent of the Muslims in the North vote for Tinubu, he has won the election,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nArewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s inability to curtail rising cases of kidnapping, killing and terrorists\u2019 attacks have exposed his ineffective leadership.\n\nThe group in a statement, yesterday, by its Secretary General, Murtala Aliyu, expressed regret over the level of insecurity, particularly in the Northern region, saying supporters of President Buhari must tell him the truth about ugly happenstance in the country, and not only what sweetens his ears.\n\n\u201cOver the past few months, the security crises we face in Nigeria has been deepening and there is a dangerous escalation of violence and bloodshed. Criminal gangs, heavily armed bandits, armed robbers, secessionist insurgents along with those that call themselves soldiers of so-called Caliphate, have laid siege to Nigeria. More so in the Northern states.\n\n\u201cThe highly coordinated attack on the Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital, Abuja, on the 5th of July, 2022, and the mass escape of hardened criminals many of whom are Boko Haram terrorists, have triggered an unprecedented wave of apprehension and panic among the long-suffering people, particularly of the North. Coming around the time the advance convoy of Mr. President heading to Daura and long after the deadly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train on the 28th of March, 2022, in which many people were killed and a lot more kidnapped, the question on the lips of the public, is how and where will these crises, which are unprecedented in severity, leave us?\u2026\n\n\u201cAlthough we count ourselves amongst his ardent supporters and have always wished him well, Nigeria\u2019s rapid descent into strife, violence and lawlessness is getting to a point at which we can no longer afford to tell him only that which he wants to hear. We do need tell the president what he also needs to hear. We simply are unable to find any courteous or less painful words to describe the feeling of utter frustration among the broad masses of Nigeria, especially in the North, arising from the ineffectual management of the security crises by the President.\n\n\u201cThe President in his Sallah message promised to deal with the situation before the end of his tenure. However, as long as the crises remains unabating, Nigerians will justifiably conclude that the government is ineffective and needs to do more if they will ever be able to quell\n\nthe crises.\n\n\u201cProbably because President Buhari is unable or unwilling to hold his appointees responsible for any deterioration of the security situation and some other socioeconomic sectors under their watch, the vast amount of money and other resources being pumped into the security agencies have largely been ineffective. The required boost in manpower and equipment, long recognized as the missing link in the current campaign, have remained largely unimplemented to the required level needed to secure the nation.\n\n\u201cIn other countries, the Kuje jail attack and similar ones that have happened in parts of Nigeria would have led to massive reshuffle, resignations and possibly prosecutions of officials that are negligent, incompetent or plainly untrustworthy.\n\n\u201cNo person other than the president has both the mandate and responsibility to ensure that the government of Nigeria maintains peace, security, order and good governance. We demand that President Buhari braces up without further delay and rise to today\u2019s occasion. The regime needs to reprioritize its programmes and free more resources needed to end the pervasive insecurity that is bringing the country to its knees.\u201d",

We have congratulated Mr. President that under his leadership, one of the most transparent primaries took place which saw the emergence of asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as our presidential flagbearer.\n\n\u201cGovernors are very very pleased.

          "text": "Edwin Clark, an Ijaw national leader and convener of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), has criticised Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), over his choice of a running mate.\n\nTinubu had, on Sunday, announced Kashim Shettima, former Borno governor, as his running mate for the 2023 general election.\n\nThe APC presidential candidate had said his decision was \u201cin the spirit of 1993\u201d when Nigerians \u201cembraced Chief MKO Abiola and a fellow Muslim running mate\u201d, but the recent development has elicited mixed reactions.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, Clark made a reference to the comments by Tinubu in Ogun state, wherein the latter had said he lost the vice-presidential slot in 2015 because the APC didn\u2019t want to run with a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ijaw leader said the decision by Tinubu doesn\u2019t reflect the secular state of the country, adding that a Muslim-Muslim ticket will promote division.\n\n\u201cI feel threatened for our beloved country because of the way things are going. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, with Christianity and Islam as the major religions, even though Nigeria is a secular state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn compliance with Constitutional provisions of inclusiveness, the number one and number two positions in the country, viz, President and Vice President, have always been occupied by practitioners of the two major religions, to ensure balancing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives\u2019 Congress (APC), Alhaji Ahmed Bola Tinubu, could not be chosen in 2015 as Vice President to Muhammadu Buhari, because he is a Muslim and Muhammadu Buhari is a Muslim. Alhaji Ahmed Bola Tinubu, in his own words, confirmed this in his statement in Abeokuta, Ogun State. What has changed? One quality of a good leader is consistency. A good leader must act in the same way at all times, to all people. He must not display double standard.\n\n\u201cToday, what has the Presidential candidate of the APC, Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu, done? He has picked a person of his religion, a Muslim, as his running-mate. Such choice is not inclusive, it is not good for a secular state like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is presently a sharp division in the country, even on religious lines, and all patriots are seeking ways to salvage the situation. Therefore, Alhaji Tinubu\u2019s decision to take a fellow Muslim as his running-mate, will further worsen the situation in the country. He should know that patriotism is a quality of a good leader.\n\n\u201cOn the reasons adduced by Alhaji Tinubu on why he chose Kashim Shettima as running mate, is the APC presidential flag bearer telling Nigerians that there are no Christians in the APC from the north who are \u2018competent, capable and reliable?'\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClark also said the decision of the APC to field people from same religion as presidential and vice-presidential candidates shows that a certain section of the country has been excluded, adding that it is wrong to assume that the south has no significant role on winning the presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is illusion to think that except one is from the north, you may not win election. So, the idea that unless you come from the north or you are a Muslim, or a Muslim supports you if you are not a Muslim, you cannot win an election, should immediately be jettisoned by proponents of such an idea. The north needs the south to be in power, same way the south needs the north to be in power. No part can do it alone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAbout 46% or more of Nigerians are Christians. Yet a group of persons want to sideline and exclude them from the affairs of the country. This is not possible.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu under pressure from these his core supporters and backers, to pick a Muslim as his running-mate, and did he cave in to the pressure because \u201cit is his turn to be President of Nigeria\u201d, despite complaints and protestations?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe PDP is the cause of these things because of its refusal to zone its presidency to the south.\n\n\u201cThese are dangerous signals. Alhaji Ahmed Tinubu cannot compare 2022/2023 with 1993. In 1993, majority of Nigerians, on their own volition, supported the Muslim/Muslim ticket of M.K.O. Abiola and Babagana Kingibe of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), as President and Vice President, 29 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was not shoved on them; it was not forced on them. Also, during that period, Nigeria was not so divided on ethnic and religious divides. If people are complaining, a good leader should listen. Unfortunately, we have leaders who not only ignore the concerns of the people with impunity, but also make crass statements.\u201d",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What to look for in a startup lawyer",
          "text": "Startups often relegate non-technology roles to the background in a bid to ship products quickly. However, these roles are often as important in the overall success of the company as the technical roles, and one such important role is that of the startup lawyer.\n\nAt the beginning of the technology boom in Africa, the standard practice was for startups to outsource their legal processes to law firms. With the increase in funding in Africa, more startups have become aware of the importance of having an in-house lawyer focused specifically on their legal needs.\n\nBeing a relatively new development, it is not far-fetched to assume that startups might not know what to look for in a startup lawyer. To identify the unique qualities a startup lawyer should have, I asked 4 lawyers what qualities startups should look for in an in-house counsel.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi is a lawyer with experience working in-house for a fintech startup and providing legal advisory for early-stage startups.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi: I think startups need to begin their questions with, \u201cDo we need an in-house lawyer or a lawyer I can reach out to when needed?\u201d I say this because, while you always need a lawyer, a couple of factors determine if you need one employed with you or if you need one on a retainer. These factors include how regulated your sector of operation is. The regulations guiding fintech and food ordering companies are very different from one another. The size and stage of your startup\u2019s growth matter as well. A startup at the ideation stage has different needs from a startup that has begun operations.\n\nYou also need to be conscious and properly assess your options when engaging a lawyer due to the nature of the role. A proper assessment cannot be understated. Like with every other kind of service, there is the tendency to have a \u201cvalue mismatch\u201d if you do not engage on the terms that fit your needs.\n\nThe first thing to look out for in a lawyer is honesty, and it is the single most important feature, to me. The reason is that a lawyer holds the life of your startup in his hands. You need a lawyer that informs you of the whole reality every time a situation comes up. Brilliance is overrated; it\u2019s the law, and there will always be a solution. You want a lawyer that can tell you, \u201cI am not sure what the position of the law on this is, allow me to run some checks.\u201d Your lawyer should be comfortable enough to tell you, \u201cThis is outside my speciality, we need to bring this person in to handle this particular part of the issue.\u201d If you find a lawyer that can be this honest with you, you are in good hands, regardless of how convoluted the legal situation might be.\n\nEmmanuel Ido is an associate at Olajide Oyewole LLP (DLA Piper Africa).\n\nEmmanuel Ido: Almost every startup is unique, from its product to its people. The role of a startup lawyer is essential to support the startup from a legal perspective such that it can function at optimum capacity. Whether the startup is pre-seed, bootstrapped or VC-funded, a good startup lawyer is crucial for its day-to-day running. Aside from the practical skills, there are a few things to look out for when hiring a lawyer for your startup.\n\nFirst, the lawyer\u2019s sector knowledge is important. When hiring a lawyer for your startup, one should consider the level of sector knowledge. This will be handy when drafting and negotiating contracts, advising the startup, and general day-to-day operations. A good startup lawyer should be well-grounded in data protection, intellectual property management, labour and employment law, corporate governance, public policy, dispute resolution, etc.\n\nAnother thing to look out for is the lawyer\u2019s sector experience. A startup lawyer must have relevant experience within the tech sector. The experience will come from doing the work. For instance, a corporate and finance lawyer who has practical experience will be suited to advising a fintech company. A quick review of their deal sheet will give you an idea of the type of lawyer they are and how suitable they will be for your startup.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s regulatory interface is also very important because it\u2019s almost impossible to operate a startup without constant regulatory interface. To this end, your lawyer should be someone with sufficient knowledge of the regulators and the relevant contacts.\n\nThe 3 categories above roughly summarise what is needed in a startup lawyer. Of course, they must have the right soft skills and are good at working in a team in a dynamic environment, as most startups are.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan is a partner at Springwoods LP.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan: The first thing that I think a startup should look for in a lawyer is transaction experience and compliance experience. This is not to say that a lawyer with experience in other fields should not be considered. However, that lawyer should be adaptable enough to learn.\n\nA startup lawyer should also be able to work in a startup environment, which is not as rigid as a law firm. The lawyer should ideally be someone that can think on their feet and be able to prioritise. It is not all conflicts that require a court sitting; some legal matters require collaboration. The lawyer should have a multi-faceted approach to legal matters.\n\nThe lawyer should also be able to maintain and build relationships with regulators and your competitors. This is very relevant. A startup lawyer should be aware of regulatory developments ahead of the public to navigate these developments smoothly. Unlike law firms, a startup can\u2019t afford a lawyer that doesn\u2019t have attention to detail.\n\nLastly, as the startup evolves so too should its legal needs evolve. An early-stage startup requires basic things like incorporation and a founder\u2019s contract. However, as you scale, the legal demands greatly increase. At this stage, the startup should liaise with its lawyer to understand the next steps to take to meet these demands.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye is a lawyer at Banwo & Ighodalo, and a writer.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye: The first thing to look out for is technical expertise. Knowledge of the law is the whole basis of a lawyer in a startup. As such, the first and most important thing is for the in-house counsel to be highly technical in the knowledge and application of law to issues arising out of your business. Also, a necessary plus is more industry-streamlined knowledge and awareness of current market solutions that are needed for that startup.\n\nPerhaps more useful for the startup than the lawyer\u2019s technical expertise is the lawyer\u2019s creativity, business savvy, and solutions-oriented outlook. The lawyer mustn\u2019t be restricted to the legal side of the startup only, as this may negatively impact some of the creative solutions that the product and engineering team may want to bring on board. It is therefore important for the founders to look out for the creative flair in the lawyer candidates they are speaking to.\n\nLastly, cultural fit is very important. While lawyers are inclined to be more regimented in their approach, working in a startup will require the flexibility of whatever candidate you are looking to scoop up into your team.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "How I Work: Henry Oji, Lead Photographer at Big H Studios",
          "text": "From photographing top celebrities to global leaders, Henry Oji\u2019s rich portfolio and years of experience has made him one of Nigeria\u2019s renowned photographers. On this edition of How I Work, talks about his journey into the world of photography as well as the tools and systems he employs to consistently create quality work.\n\nCurrent role: Lead Photographer at Big H Studios and Mentor\n\nLocation: Abuja, Nigeria\n\nCurrent computer: iMac\n\nCurrent mobile device: iPhone X\n\nDescribe how you work in one sentence: Building relationships\n\nTell us briefly how you started out and how you got where you are today\n\nI started photography in 2012. After my wedding, I traveled with my wife for my honeymoon and on our way back, I got my first DSLR camera. I always wanted to be that guy who would attend friends\u2019 weddings with a proper camera; not necessarily professional, but I was never a fan of using iPads and all that stuff. Somehow, I think what was an interest became a strong interest, and then from a strong interest, it became a passion.\n\nThe journey hasn\u2019t particularly been easy, but I like to say that God has been very faithful. In the last 10 years, there have been times when it\u2019s been exciting, hard, and excruciatingly difficult. But in all, it has been a good journey because both the exciting parts and the difficult parts have led to forming the person that I am today. And I wouldn\u2019t wish to have it any better than I\u2019ve had it.\n\nWhat does your work entail? Walk us through a typical workday\n\nI\u2019m the lead photographer at Big H Studios. There are other photographers: associate photographers and intern photographers. My role is to coordinate the work across board and to ensure that we deliver the service that people are paying for. So if someone comes into the studio or has been booked for a photo shoot, we want to ensure that the experience is pleasant from the beginning to the end.\n\nFrom when they either make a call or send an email, there\u2019s somebody who books the clients and then we have consultations to acquaint ourselves with the client and also share creative ideas for the shoot. After that, on the day of the shoot, we have assistants who help with the shoot. Once the shoot is done, we send the images to the editing team, but before that, I would handle what many people call color grade or the color work. And after that is done, I would send the pictures to the editing team to finish the skin work. When that is done, the images are sent back to me for final proofing. So it\u2019s just to ensure quality control and that all the images meet the required standard.\n\nSo a typical day for me at work is really just coordinating and ensuring that everybody who has a unique or specific role is carrying out that role to the best of their ability.\n\nBeyond that, there is also the mentorship aspect. We have an academy called the Follow The Light class and when we have classes, there\u2019s also a change in role where I become not just a convener of the class, but also a facilitator and I teach in this class.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you do without?\n\nI think that as a photographer, you can\u2019t do without your eyes. And by eyes, I\u2019m not necessarily referring to your ability to see with your two eyeballs because I also know that there are a few people who are blind and are also photographers. By eyes, I am referring to your ability to see in your mind. That\u2019s the first thing that we use to be able to conceive these images.\n\nThen we move to the actual tools that I work with, which are my camera, my lights, Capture One, Photoshop, and my iMac. That\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite shortcut or hack for getting things done?\n\nI think the only shortcut is to just do the work, to be honest. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve been able to devise a particular hack. If at all there is a shortcut, I would say, do the work and delegate where you can so that you don\u2019t overburden yourself with a lot of work.\n\nWhat task(s) do you dislike but still do?\n\nFrom the process of having to conceive the idea, meet with the client, shoot the client, and edit the pictures, my least favorite task would be selecting images, especially wedding images. For an average wedding, you\u2019re looking at over 2,000 pictures. So you have to profile 2,000 images and in some cases, out of 2,000 images, you\u2019re only going to have to select 200 or 300.\n\nThat process can be tedious because you have to make sure that the ones that you\u2019ve selected are the absolute best.\n\nIt\u2019s not something that I can\u2019t do but it\u2019s just not as exciting as all the other tasks that we do.\n\nHow do you keep track of what you have to do?\n\nI have a team that I work with. We have a studio manager who handles the activities of the studio: payment of bills, purchase of equipment, and all the other stuff. We have an admin that is almost like HR and handles the day to day activities and the people in the studio. And we have a creative director who deals with creative mood boards, planning and execution of shoots, and personnel management.\n\nEverybody has their unique role and I think when everybody is functioning optimally, everything goes smoothly. So I just depend on my team and if my team is working, then everything is working.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nI\u2019m still trying to find that, sadly. I\u2019m not the best person at taking a break. But generally speaking, if I want to take a break, I would travel or do something that is not directly related to photography.\n\nIt\u2019s not something that I do all the time. I have traveled before; I had a creative block in 2018 and I traveled to a very far place for a conference and came back very refreshed and ready to go.\n\nIf you are in a system that is causing burn out or contributing to stress levels, then my advice would be to take a few steps away from the system and do things that are not necessarily related to the system.\n\nOf late, we\u2019ve been working from home, so I\u2019ve also started to prioritize rest. Once upon a time, I used to work very late, sometimes into the next day, sometimes I slept in the studio, but I realized that no matter how hard you work, there\u2019s always going to be more work. So you have to be very intentional about creating time for rest.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to, watching or reading?\n\nI\u2019m not big on watching movies or series. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make me more mature than anybody, it\u2019s just that sometimes I look at things from the perspective of time, and for the kind of work that we do, you can\u2019t give two hours to watch a movie if you\u2019re owing clients pictures. You won\u2019t be able to watch it with peace of mind because you\u2019ve not been able to deliver.\n\nBut when I do watch, I like to watch martial arts and comedy movies. I like to watch comedy a lot because laughing is very important in any type of work. So even now, I watch a lot of Instagram skits \u2013 the funny ones. I\u2019m also a fan of Marvel, the Avengers and all that stuff.\n\nFor music, I\u2019m always listening to instrumentals. It helps me to calm down because sometimes, there\u2019s a tendency to want to be on the edge with the work. I used to listen to Maverick city but I haven\u2019t paid attention to any of the new songs. My go-to person right now is some guy on YouTube called DappyTKeys. Other than that, random Christian music and sometimes, maybe when I\u2019m working out and need something upbeat, then I could listen to some Afrobeat Nigerian songs.\n\nAre you reading anything right now or are there things you\u2019d recommend?\n\nI want to read my Bible a lot more. I\u2019ve been slacking on that. I used to read a lot, I have a library but to be very honest in the last four years, I haven\u2019t really gotten back to it. I think I just need to be able to discipline myself to make time and read.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nMy late brother once said to me, \u201cnever share your opinion of other people with other people, because you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d\n\nOne of my favorite pieces of advice from my late father was when it comes to money and friends, he said, \u201cdo not give a friend money that you cannot forgo because at a point you will have to choose between the money and your friend.\u201d\n\nFor any photographer or creative listening, my advice would be to just keep shooting, keep practicing, keep getting better, and that success isn\u2019t a destination but a journey.\n\nThe last advice would be that every blessing that God gives us is people centered. So it is not for you alone to say, \u201coh, I have been blessed, let me enjoy the fruits of my labor.\u201d Every time God deposits something, whether it\u2019s a gift, finances, whatever it is, it is because he wants you to be a channel to bless other people.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem you are still trying to solve?\n\nI\u2019ve always said I want to create a podcast, and I actually gave this year as a target, but I am very far from achieving that. I started this year with a lot of enthusiasm, spoke to somebody about it, got the equipment that I needed, and got the space ready, but we\u2019re already approaching the end of July and nothing reasonable has come out of that.\n\nI really want to have a podcast channel so that I can just share life experiences and also invite people who can also share their own personal experiences.\n\nWho would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nBeyonce, because of her work ethic. I\u2019m not a big fan of her music per se or every other thing that she represents, but there was something that she said once that stuck with me. When she was preparing for a show and wanted something done, the organizers and the people who were helping her with the performance said \u201cBeyonce, this is absolutely impossible, nobody has ever done this before, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d And then she said, that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re going to do it.\n\nThat has really just stuck with me because success isn\u2019t cheap, you have to put in the work and you have to somehow be crazy. I feel like, if she answers these questions, there are a couple of things that she would touch that would inspire so many people, myself included.\n\nAlso, Barack Obama. I just really like him a lot and how he presents himself, how he speaks and some of the things that he does. Though, I\u2019m not a big fan of some other things about him.\n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) as a leader. I know many people don\u2019t like him but it\u2019ll be interesting to hear his views.\n\nAnd then in the photography world, I would say TY Bello and Kelechi Amadi. It would be good to get to know who they are, what makes them tick, what makes them humble even after they\u2019ve achieved so much.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Russia and Ukraine standoff, vis a vis boycott of Russian gas has triggered significant disruptions and created a huge shortage in global gas supply chain.\n\nAvailable data indicate that Russia is the world\u2019s largest natural gas exporter; exporting 238 billion cubic meters in 2020 and accounting for about 45 per cent the EU\u2019s imports in 2021.\n\nIt implies that any dislodgement in Russia\u2019s gas supply would leave a deep crater which must be exploited by Nigeria, with natural gas reserve of 209.5 trillion cubic feet.\n\nPerceptive stakeholders hold that the economic trump card of sanctions on Russia for Nigeria, as a ranking gas producing and exporting nation, is immense.\n\nExpectedly, Nigeria is savouring the prospects of being a buffer and cashing in on the void.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, while on a state visit to Portugal recently, indicated that Nigeria is ready to fill the natural gas gaps in Europe predicated by the current Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nBuhari said with over 200 million mainly young people, Nigeria was ready to be the hub of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA).\n\nThe president urged Portugal to consider Nigeria as a valued and trusted partner in Africa.\n\nHe identified key areas of cooperation and collaboration capable of moving both countries forward as oil and gas, tourism and hospitality industry, air travel, security and joint commission.\n\n\u201cAt a time the world is going through turbulent times, we feel that a strong friendship and partnership between Nigeria and Portugal can act as a force for good.\n\n\u201cWith the current Russian-Ukraine war, increased cooperation in oil and gas between the two countries has become vital to avoid crisis in the demand and supply chain, even as Nigeria is already a major supplier of gas to Portugal,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president added that Nigeria and Portugal could cooperate closely on a range of agricultural and renewable energy projects.\n\nTo add some verve to Nigeria\u2019s drive to reap from gap in the global gas supply chain, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) recently presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo approved for the NNPC to enter into agreement with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who made the disclosure, said that the project was still at the point of the front end engineering design, after which the cost would be determined.\n\nThe pipeline would traverse 15 West African countries to Morocco and Spain.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Petroleum Resources presented three memos to Council.\n\n\u201cThe first memo, council approved for the NNPC Ltd to execute MoU with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline.\n\n\u201cThis gas pipeline is to take gas to 15 West African countries and to Morocco and through Morocco to Spain and Europe.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe minister said that the council also approved the construction of a switch gear room and installation of power distribution cables and equipment for the Nigeria Oil and Gas Park in Ogbia, Bayelsa. The cost of the project was put at N3.8billion.\n\nHe said that the park was to support local manufacturing of components for the oil and gas industry.\n\nNigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline was proposed in a December 2016 agreement between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Moroccan Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (National Board of Hydrocarbons and Mines) (ONHYM).\n\nThe pipeline would connect Nigerian gas to every coastal country in West Africa (Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Senegal and Mauritania), ending at Tangiers, Morocco, and C\u00e1diz, Spain.\n\nSylva also elucidated on Nigeria\u2019s readiness to offer its services as an alternative gas supplier to Europe when he received a delegation, led by Samuela Isopi, EU\u2019s Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS.\n\nHe urged EU to increase investments in gas and hydrocarbons in Nigeria to be able to meet the bloc\u2019s energy needs.\n\nThe minister implored the EU to encourage its oil and gas companies such as Shell, Eni, and Total Energies to scale up investments in the Nigerian gas sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we warned against earlier was the speed with which the EU was taking away investments in fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe warned that the speed was faster than they were developing renewable energy; you can see now that what we were warning against is what is happening now.\u201d\n\nHe told the delegation that what stunted growth in the development of gas in Nigeria was fresh investments, and called for a change of attitude on the part of the EU, if its requests to increase supplies to Europe would be realised.\n\nThe minister said that one of the biggest challenges the sector faces was lack of investments.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, over 70 billion dollars worth of investments came to Africa, but sadly less than four billion dollars came to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, we are the biggest in Africa; if we cannot attract investments to Nigeria, you know where we are heading.\n\n\u201cYou have been our long time friend; as at today, our gas reserve is one of the biggest in the world; we have a proven gas reserve of 206 tcf and if we really focus on gas exploitation we can get up to 600 tcf.\n\n\u201cWe are already building gas infrastructure such as the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipeline project, expected to take gas to Algeria, and the West Africa Gas Pipeline project designed to take gas to Morroco.\u201d\n\nThe minister said that due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the EU must have a buffer or an alternative source of gas.\n\n\u201cWe would like to be reliable partners to solve the energy problem in Europe and we can only achieve this by working together.\n\n\u201cIt is only when investment in these areas is increased that Nigeria can meet that obligation,\u201d he said.\n\nSharing similar sentiments, Sarah Anyanwu, Professor of Development, Department of Economics, University of Abuja, said it was ample opportunity for Nigeria to increase production.\n\nAnyanwu said that Nigeria had surplus gas and called on the concerned authorities to up the ante.\n\n\u201cWe have been talking on the issues of diversifying the economy; so, these are the areas apart from oil that government should cease the opportunity and key into.\n\n\u201cWe have areas to explore and make more foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cNot only Nigeria, OPEC countries should step up; that\u2019s an opportunity for us to make more money from gas; it lies in increasing production.\n\n\u201cThe glut globally is for our good. Nigeria should cease the opportunity; increase production and breakthrough from this mono-cultural economy,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nExperts are of the submission that the diversification mantra has reverberated for many years; hence the urgent need for pragmatic steps.\n\nThey say that the interregnum in global gas supply presents a gaping opportunity for Nigeria to ramp up gas export and reap bountifully from a ready market.\n\n_____________________\n\nChijioke Okoronkwo, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n(NANFeatures)\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nA living room is a place in a home that is supposed to be for family time, bonding and watching television, but men\u2019s obsession for football lately is making the living room become a war zone between couples.\n\nWith their husbands\u2019 eyes and souls glued to the television screen displaying a football match, would wives agree to share the attention of their men with football?\n\nHow do wives cope with husbands who are football fanatics? When a match is lost, how do wives cope with its effect on their husbands?\n\nFootball is a game which engages every soul interested in it, with its suspense, disappointments, shock, failure, success and at last, victory. Do wives accept to bear this cross?\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday spoke with some women in Lagos metropolis to get their feelings about this.\n\nMrs Theresa Adelusi, an agricultural engineer, and mother of four, said her husband loves football after God.\n\n\u201cIf you want to serve food to my husband when he is watching football, he will say no. He gives total attention to that football that he is watching. He doesn\u2019t give attention to anyone.\n\nAdelusi said that the mood of the house depends on her husband\u2019s favorite club.\n\n\u201cIf Chelsea loses a match, the whole house will feel the impact. But if they win, ask for anything and he will give you.\n\n\u201cSometimes I wonder how rich he would be if he got paid for his dedication, and\n\nmy question, why should a happy moment in my household be determined by the result of a football team?\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Catherine Bamgbose, CEO, Tulips Beauty Glow and mother of one, said her husband gives much attention to football and hates being disturbed when watching football.\n\n\u201cIf you disturb my husband when watching a match, he doesn\u2019t mind, he switches his phone on and watches it online.\n\n\u201cThat is the only time I get to serve him any food of my choice and he doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to complain.\n\n\u201cHe loves football to the extent that he won\u2019t eat for hours if his favorite club, Barcelona, loses,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Mrs Gloria Ndubuisi, a lawyer and a mother of four, her husband watches football with so much passion as if his life depends on it.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of our marriage, it caused lots of problems. Sometimes, when there\u2019s power outage, he would fuel the generator with a part of the children\u2019s school fees to watch a match and I will be bitter.\n\n\u201cThere was even a time he slapped our eldest daughter for changing the channel to Zee world. It was a horrible experience,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Lynda Essien, a business woman and a mother of one, said her husband hates it when someone changes the channel while he\u2019s watching a football match.\n\n\u201cMy husband becomes moody when his favourite club, Manchester United, loses a match. But he comes around after some time,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Mrs Martha Orakwe, a teacher and a mother of six, her husband\u2019s weakest point is football.\n\n\u201cMy husband\u2019s Achilles heel is football. He is very collected and gentle but when it comes to football, I don\u2019t recognise him and get his attention anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nOrakwe said that her husband not only watches a football match on television but also listens to the commentaries on radio,even while driving.\n\n\u201cI remember a time my husband\u2019s favourite club Chelsea lost a match. He heard this from the commentary on radio and we almost had an accident that day,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Funmi Adekunle, a businesswoman and mother of two, said that she had no choice but love football because of her husband\u2019s obsession for the game and to avoid conflict in her home.\n\n\u201cMy husband is more than a football lover. I decided to join him and be a football fan than to be fighting with him over the television remote,\u201d she said.\n\nAdekunle advised wives to give up the fight over the remote or channels and join their husbands to watch and love the game.\n\n\u201cFootball is a game that binds people together. It brings together different nations, tribes, colour, races, and even religion. This is the same game that will bring your family together.\u201d she advised.\n\nHowever, some men, in their reactions told NAN that watching football helped them ease their stress and temporarily makes them forget their daily challenges.\n\nMr Sola Adeleke, a civil servant, told NAN that most men watch football for excitement.\n\n\u201cAs a man, there are lots of challenges we face daily, but the thought of watching your club play brings excitement; I don\u2019t think men do this thing to spite their wives.\n\n\u201cA match either at home or at bar with a chill drink relaxes the body, I stopped following a particular club because of several failures from them, so these days I just enjoy quality football and rest,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ikenna Ofem, told NAN that the battle for television remote when he is watching his favourite club play, made him buy a dual view decoder.\n\n\u201cWith this, I can be in my room to watch my favourite sport channels without disturbance, while the rest of the family watch their favourite channels in the living room.\n\n\u201cIt was expensive getting another TV and running the whole package but it was worth it, it was almost becoming a tug of war in my household,\u201d he said.

However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism.

On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

          "text": "Nigerian women have lamented their husbands\u2019 obsession with football.\n\nAccording to some of the women who spoke on the development on Monday, the situation had turned their living rooms to war zones.\n\nAn agricultural engineer, Mrs Theresa Adelusi, said her husband loves football after God.\n\n\u201cIf you want to serve food to my husband when he is watching football, he will say no. He gives total attention to that football that he is watching. He doesn\u2019t give attention to anyone\u201d, said the mother of four.\n\nShe also added that the mood of the house depends on her husband\u2019s favorite club.\n\n\u201cIf Chelsea loses a match, the whole house will feel the impact. But if they win, ask for anything and he will give you.\n\n\u201cSometimes I wonder how rich he would be if he got paid for his dedication, and my question, why should a happy moment in my household be determined by the result of a football team?\u201d she said.\n\nAnother respondent, Mrs Catherine Bamgbose, CEO, Tulips Beauty Glow, said her husband gives much attention to football and hates being disturbed when watching football.\n\n\u201cIf you disturb my husband when watching a match, he doesn\u2019t mind, he switches his phone on and watches it online.\n\n\u201cThat is the only time I get to serve him any food of my choice and he doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to complain.\n\n\u201cHe loves football to the extent that he won\u2019t eat for hours if his favorite club, Barcelona, loses,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to a lawyer and a mother of four, Mrs Gloria Ndubuisi, her husband watches football with so much passion as if his life depends on it.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of our marriage, it caused lots of problems. Sometimes, when there\u2019s power outage, he would fuel the generator with a part of the children\u2019s school fees to watch a match and I will be bitter.\n\n\u201cThere was even a time he slapped our eldest daughter for changing the channel to Zee world. It was a horrible experience,\u201d she said.\n\nA business woman, Mrs Lynda Essien, said her husband hates it when someone changes the channel while he\u2019s watching a football match.\n\n\u201cMy husband becomes moody when his favourite club, Manchester United, loses a match. But he comes around after some time,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Mrs Martha Orakwe, a teacher and a mother of six, her husband\u2019s weakest point is football.\n\n\u201cMy husband\u2019s Achilles heel is football. He is very collected and gentle but when it comes to football, I don\u2019t recognise him and get his attention anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nOrakwe said that her husband not only watches a football match on television but also listens to the commentaries on radio,even while driving.\n\n\u201cI remember a time my husband\u2019s favourite club Chelsea lost a match. He heard this from the commentary on radio and we almost had an accident that day,\u201d she said.\n\nA businesswoman, Mrs Funmi Adekunle, said that she had no choice but love football because of her husband\u2019s obsession for the game and to avoid conflict in her home.\n\n\u201cMy husband is more than a football lover. I decided to join him and be a football fan than to be fighting with him over the television remote,\u201d she said.\n\nAdekunle advised wives to give up the fight over the remote or channels and join their husbands to watch and love the game.\n\n\u201cFootball is a game that binds people together. It brings together different nations, tribes, colour, races, and even religion. This is the same game that will bring your family together.\u201d she advised.\n\nHowever, some men, in their reactions said that watching football helped them ease their stress and temporarily makes them forget their daily challenges.\n\nA civil servant, Mr Sola Adeleke, said that most men watch football for excitement.\n\n\u201cAs a man, there are lots of challenges we face daily, but the thought of watching your club play brings excitement; I don\u2019t think men do this thing to spite their wives.\n\n\u201cA match either at home or at bar with a chill drink relaxes the body, I stopped following a particular club because of several failures from them, so these days I just enjoy quality football and rest,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ikenna Ofem said that the battle for television remote when he is watching his favourite club play, made him buy a dual view decoder.\n\n\u201cWith this, I can be in my room to watch my favourite sport channels without disturbance, while the rest of the family watch their favourite channels in the living room.\n\n\u201cIt was expensive getting another TV and running the whole package but it was worth it, it was almost becoming a tug of war in my household,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Elder statesman and convener of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Chief Edwin Clark, has lashed out against the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, over his choice of a running mate.\n\nTinubu had on Sunday, announced the former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, as his running mate for the 2023 general election.\n\nThe APC presidential candidate had said his decision was \u201cin the spirit of 1993\u201d when Nigerians \u201cembraced Chief MKO Abiola and a fellow Muslim running mate\u201d, but the recent development has elicited mixed reactions.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, Clark made a reference to the comments by Tinubu in Ogun State, wherein the latter had said he lost the vice-presidential slot in 2015 because the APC didn\u2019t want to run with a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe Ijaw leader said the decision by Tinubu doesn\u2019t reflect the secular state of the country, adding that a Muslim-Muslim ticket will promote division.\n\n\u201cI feel threatened for our beloved country because of the way things are going. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, with Christianity and Islam as the major religions, even though Nigeria is a secular state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn compliance with Constitutional provisions of inclusiveness, the number one and number two positions in the country, viz, President and Vice President, have always been occupied by practitioners of the two major religions, to ensure balancing.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives\u2019 Congress (APC), Alhaji Ahmed Bola Tinubu, could not be chosen in 2015 as Vice President to Muhammadu Buhari, because he is a Muslim and Muhammadu Buhari is a Muslim. Alhaji Ahmed Bola Tinubu, in his own words, confirmed this in his statement in Abeokuta, Ogun State. What has changed? One quality of a good leader is consistency. A good leader must act in the same way at all times, to all people. He must not display double standard.\n\n\u201cToday, what has the Presidential candidate of the APC, Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu, done? He has picked a person of his religion, a Muslim, as his running-mate. Such choice is not inclusive, it is not good for a secular state like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is presently a sharp division in the country, even on religious lines, and all patriots are seeking ways to salvage the situation. Therefore, Alhaji Tinubu\u2019s decision to take a fellow Muslim as his running-mate, will further worsen the situation in the country. He should know that patriotism is a quality of a good leader.\n\n\u201cOn the reasons adduced by Alhaji Tinubu on why he chose Kashim Shettima as running mate, is the APC presidential flag bearer telling Nigerians that there are no Christians in the APC from the north who are \u2018competent, capable and reliable?\u2019\u201d\n\nClark also said the decision of the APC to field people from same religion as presidential and vice-presidential candidates shows that a certain section of the country has been excluded, adding that it is wrong to assume that the south has no significant role on winning the presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is illusion to think that except one is from the north, you may not win election. So, the idea that unless you come from the north or you are a Muslim, or a Muslim supports you if you are not a Muslim, you cannot win an election, should immediately be jettisoned by proponents of such an idea. The north needs the south to be in power, same way the south needs the north to be in power. No part can do it alone.\n\n\u201cAbout 46% or more of Nigerians are Christians. Yet a group of persons want to sideline and exclude them from the affairs of the country. This is not possible.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu under pressure from these his core supporters and backers, to pick a Muslim as his running-mate, and did he cave in to the pressure because \u201cit is his turn to be President of Nigeria\u201d, despite complaints and protestations?\n\n\u201cThe PDP is the cause of these things because of its refusal to zone its presidency to the south.\n\n\u201cThese are dangerous signals. Alhaji Ahmed Tinubu cannot compare 2022/2023 with 1993. In 1993, majority of Nigerians, on their own volition, supported the Muslim/Muslim ticket of M.K.O. Abiola and Babagana Kingibe of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), as President and Vice President, 29 years ago.\n\n\u201cIt was not shoved on them; it was not forced on them. Also, during that period, Nigeria was not so divided on ethnic and religious divides. If people are complaining, a good leader should listen.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have leaders who not only ignore the concerns of the people with impunity, but also make crass statements,\u201d the former federal commissioner said.",

Truly, enough is enough for keeping students at home. Don\u2019t hurt the next generation for goodness sake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President called on all well-meaning Nigerians, particularly those close to the leaders and members of the association, to intervene in persuading the lecturers to reconsider their position, and the ripple effect on an entire generation and the nation.\n\nBuhari said students from Nigerian universities will be faced with the challenge of competing with others in a highly connected and technology-driven work space, and keeping them at home only deprives them of time, skill and opportunities to be relevant on the global stage.\n\n\u201cColonial type education was geared towards producing workers in government. Those jobs are no longer there. Our young people should get education to prepare them for self-employment. Now education is for the sake of education.\n\n\u201cThrough technology we are much more efficient. We should encourage our children to get education, not only to look for government jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nBuhari said resources should be channeled more into building infrastructure and operations of the health and educational sector, not to expand the bureaucracy to create job opportunities.\n\n\u201cBy this time next year, I would have made the most out of the two terms, and the remaining months I will do my best,\u201d the President noted.\n\nBuhari urged those in political positions and places of privilege to be mindful in helping the many Nigerians that were looking for opportunities.\n\n\u201cIf you are greedy, you won\u2019t look around to see what is happening with those who are less endowed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told the governors and political leaders that he had not been to his house in Daura for close to a year due to the demands of office.\n\nPresident Buhari said he would retire to Daura, not Kaduna, where he had a better house.\n\nThe President said relative to the resources available, and compared to the last administration, the government had done well in many areas, particularly in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI wish the person who is coming after me the very best,\u201d he said.\n\nOn security, the President said the North West had posed more challenges, and some success had been recorded in other regions, North East and South South.\n\nBuhari advised some indigenes in the South South to stop hurting national assets, which also affect their livelihood.\n\n\u201cI am eager to go. I can tell you it has been tough. I am grateful to God that people appreciate the personal sacrifices we have been making,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, the Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, thanked the President for his leadership roles in improving the economy of the nation and the many successes recorded at the APC, which include two conventions to produce the party leadership and the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nBagudu, who is the Governor of Kebbi State, said the favorable seasons supported the vision of ensuring food production and making agriculture a priority, with clear results in rice pyramids in various states.",

Kanu, the Bishop of Methodist Church, Diocese of Isuikwuato, has commended Dr. Alex Otti, governorship candidate of Labour Party in Abia State for remaining consistent in his quest for good governance in the state.\n\nKanu spoke at the induction and award ceremony organised by the Young Men\u2019s Fellowship of the Methodist Church Nigeria, Diocese of Isuikwuato, on Sunday.\n\nThe clergy who could not hide his excitement at the presence of the Labour Party standard bearer, affirmed that Otti had shown the character of a true statesman through his courage and consistency in demanding and fighting for good governance in Abia state.\n\nHe noted that unlike some politicians who would only show up during election period, Otti is a formidable voice of opposition in Abia politics and has remained visible and outspoken.\n\nThe Methodist Bishop also thanked the former bank chief for his numerous philanthropic gestures to the citizens of Abia State, through his Alex Otti Foundation.\n\nHe further commended Otti for using his goodwill to facilitate the construction of the strategic Umuasua Road in Isuikwuato community, saying such was a pointer to what the ex-banker would do when given the opportunity to serve the people of Abia.\n\nAccording to a statement issued Monday by Otti\u2019s special adviser on media, Ferdinand Ekeoma, Bishop Kanu emphatically declared that he and his entire household had since become \u201cObidient\u201d and encouraged Abians and Nigerians on the need to become Obidient for the good of the nation and the citizens.\n\nOtti, who was a special guest of honour at the occasion, while speaking, described Methodist Church as one of the largest Churches in Nigeria, and praised the church for its efforts in winning souls for Christ.\n\nHe challenged the leadership of the church to double its effort so as to consolidate the place of the Church in Christendom.\n\nThe gubernatorial hopeful enjoined members of the congregation on the need to get actively involved in politics, insisting that since politics is about leadership, it would be suicidal to leave it in the hands of dishonourable persons, insisting that doing the same thing same old way and expecting a different result, would amount to an exercise in futility.\n\nHe told the gathering that the prelude to having good roads, electricity, functional healthcare system, payment of salaries and pensions, was to get their PVC, and be ready to take back their state and country at the appropriate time.\n\nHe charged the inductees to continue to drive a vision that would impact the society positively.\n\nThe Bishop and other clergymen offered special prayer for Otti and his wife.",

Truly, enough is enough for keeping students at home. Don\u2019t hurt the next generation for goodness sake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President called on all well meaning Nigerians, particularly those close to the leaders and members of the association, to intervene in persuading the lecturers to reconsider their position, and the ripple effect on an entire generation and the nation.\n\nPresident Buhari said students from Nigerian universities will be faced with the challenge of competing with others in a highly connected and technology-driven work space, and keeping them at home only deprives them of time, skill and opportunities to be relevant on the global stage.\n\n\u201cColonial type education was geared towards producing workers in government. Those jobs are no longer there. Our young people should get education to prepare them for self-employment. Now education is for the sake of education.\n\n\u201cThrough technology we are much more efficient. We should encourage our children to get education, not only to look for government jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said resources should be channeled more into building infrastructure and operations of the health and educational sector, not to expand the bureaucracy to create job opportunities.\n\n\u201cBy this time next year, I would have made the most out of the two terms, and the remaining months I will do my best,\u201d the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari urged those in political positions and places of privilege to be mindful in helping the many Nigerians that were looking for opportunities.\n\n\u201cIf you are greedy, you won\u2019t look around to see what is happening with those who are less endowed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told the governors and political leaders that he had not been to his house in Daura for close to a year due to the demands of office.\n\n\u201cThe observation that I abandoned my base was made by the Emir of Daura, Dr Faruk Umar Faruk, at the eid prayer ground. He held the microphone and told everyone that the last time I was in Daura was during the Eid-el-Kabir of 2021,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said he would retire to Daura, not Kaduna, where he had a better house.\n\n\u201cIn ten to eleven months time, I will come here. I have a better house in Kaduna, but it is too close to Abuja,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President explained that the schedule of work was much, saying he recently had to sympathise with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, who had to be away most of the time from his family.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the APC stalwarts to keep working for the good of the people and the country, noting that \u201c We are a lucky people, and we need to reflect more on where we are coming from.\u201d\n\nThe President said relative to the resources available, and compared to the last administration, the government had done well in many areas, particularly in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI wish the person who is coming after me the very best,\u201d he said.\n\nOn security, the President said the North West had posed more challenges, and some success had been recorded in other regions, North East and South South.\n\nPresident Buhari advised some indigenes in the South South to stop hurting national assets, which also affect their livelihood.\n\n\u201cI am eager to go. I can tell you it has been tough. I am grateful to God that people appreciate the personal sacrifices we have been making,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, the chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, thanked the President for his leadership roles in improving the economy of the nation and the many successes recorded at the APC, which include two conventions to produce the party leadership and the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe will work hard to ensure the success of our party. We have reasons to work very hard,\u201d he added.\n\nBagudu, who is the Governor of Kebbi State, said the favorable seasons supported the vision of ensuring food production and making agriculture a priority, with clear results in rice pyramids in various states.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the attacks by the renegades, our country remains self-sufficient in food production. We have seen investments that were not there before you came into power.\n\n\u201cNot less than 20 states now have agriculture process zones. We have rice pyramid in Ekiti, Gombe and Niger, while maize pyramids were revived in Katsina and Kano states,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said more than 54 rice meals were commissioned in various states, and 57 fertiliser plants were revived, or built afresh.\n\n\u201cAll these were achieved because of your commitment and patriotism,\u201d the governor told the President.\n\nBagudu also appreciated the President for providing ease of access to governors and political leaders, noting that the opening of the National Economic Council for more fluid exchange of ideas greatly helped in improving the economy.\n\nAPC Governors at the lunch with the President; Katsina State, Rt Hon.

I have a better house in Kaduna, but it is too close to Abuja,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President explained that the schedule of work was much, saying he recently had to sympathise with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, who had to be away most of the time from his family.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the APC stalwarts to keep working for the good of the people and the country, noting that \u201c We are a lucky people, and we need to reflect more on where we are coming from.\u201d\n\nThe President said relative to the resources available, and compared to the last administration, the government had done well in many areas, particularly in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI wish the person who is coming after me the very best,\u201d he said.\n\nOn security, the President said the North West had posed more challenges, and some success had been recorded in other regions, North East and South South.\n\nPresident Buhari advised some indigenes in the South South to stop hurting national assets, which also affect their livelihood.\n\n\u201cI am eager to go. I can tell you it has been tough. I am grateful to God that people appreciate the personal sacrifices we have been making,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, the chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, thanked the President for his leadership roles in improving the economy of the nation and the many successes recorded at the APC, which include two conventions to produce the party leadership and the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe will work hard to ensure the success of our party. We have reasons to work very hard,\u201d he added.\n\nBagudu, who is the Governor of Kebbi State, said the favorable seasons supported the vision of ensuring food production and making agriculture a priority, with clear results in rice pyramids in various states.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the attacks by the renegades, our country remains self-sufficient in food production. We have seen investments that were not there before you came into power.\n\n\u201cNot less than 20 states now have agriculture process zones. We have rice pyramid in Ekiti, Gombe and Niger, while maize pyramids were revived in Katsina and Kano states,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said more than 54 rice meals were commissioned in various states, and 57 fertiliser plants were revived, or built afresh.\n\n\u201cAll these were achieved because of your commitment and patriotism,\u201d the governor told the President.\n\nBagudu also appreciated the President for providing ease of access to governors and political leaders, noting that the opening of the National Economic Council for more fluid exchange of ideas greatly helped in improving the economy.\n\nAPC Governors at the lunch with the President; Katsina State, Rt Hon.

          "text": "By Jethro Ibileke\n\nAkin Agbaje, a former commissioner for energy in Edo under Governor Godwin Obaseki has returned to the All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nAgbaje was received by former national chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole, on Sunday at his home in Igarra, Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of Edo State on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Oshiomhole warned political leaders against what he described as institutionalisation of poverty among the citizens.\n\nHe noted that it is very dangerous for a man to be the only one who can feed in his community, and that it is more dangerous for a country where only few look unto tomorrow with hope.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have gotten to a point that all Nigerian leaders that are in politics and in business must recognise that we must build and rebuild a country worthy for all.\n\n\u201cWe are not relying on what statisticians tell us. If they say our economy is growing at 20 percent per week, we must ask the question, is the pieces of meat on our table increasing by 20 percent every month? If it is not, something is wrong.\n\n\u201cAt this age, I have a duty to my country to identify others to rebuild the ladder which made it possible for me as the son of a farmer in a village that was not on the map to go to school without fees and grow to become the governor of this state.\u201d\n\nThe former Edo state governor alleged that the government of Governor Godwin Obaseki had received N16 billion from the federal government as a refund for the federal roads that his (Oshiomhole\u2019s) administration constructed, adding that such money ought to be used to construct more roads for the people.\n\nThis is even as he cautioned that constituency projects appropriation should be for the benefit of the entire community and not for a few.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cParliament is not about buying two motorbikes called constituency projects given to two youths out of about 4000 youths. It isn\u2019t about buying small 20 grinding machines to give to about 20,000 women.\n\n\u201cI warned against what I called celebration and institutionalisation of poverty.\n\n\u201cIn the Senate, we must ensure that in making appropriation, we do it for the benefits of the people.\n\n\u201cIf we make that road that crosses Akoko-Edo that I built when I was a governor and many other too, which of course I am aware that the federal government has refunded the money to my successor worth about N16 billion, such can be further used to making more roads for our people. We must rebuild that road which was destroyed because of the failure of federal government roads.\n\n\u201cThat will not be a favour but pending duty. That is why your senator should sit on the floor of the senate and insist that the agenda of the Edo North cannot be down-played.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remark, Agbaje who was the then Director of Obaseki Campaign Organisation during the 2020 governorship election, described his return to the APC with hundreds of his supporters as coming back home to roost.\n\nHe vowed to join hands with other leaders of the party to comb Akoko Edo for victory in next year\u2019s general election.",

          "text": "NEWS DIRECT has learned that terrorists are requesting a N100m ransom for each of the 43 passengers from the Kaduna train who have been kidnapped and are currently in their custody.\n\nThe request was made known to the hostage-families taker\u2019s last week.\n\nThis is just five days after numerous armed men on Tuesday rescued the suspected abduction planners from the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Center in Abuja.\n\nA 24-hour period after the incident, the Islamic State West Africa Province released a viral video to take responsibility for it.\n\nDuring the attack, the terrorists overpowered the security guards monitoring the facility and released approximately 300 Boko Haram fighters, convicted criminals, and other prisoners.\n\nThe Federal Government on Thursday uploaded to the Interpol database the data of 64 Boko Haram commanders who escaped from custody during the attack.\n\nNEWS DIRECT had reported that the terrorists attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train on March 28, killing eight and kidnapping no fewer than 61 passengers.\n\nAs part of their demands, they requested the release of 15 terrorist commanders, their children detained by the military and an undisclosed amount of cash.\n\nOn June 12, the terrorists released 11 hostages after 75 days in captivity, while another seven regained their freedom on Saturday.\n\nThe victims were reportedly released through the assistance of the Publisher of Kaduna-based Desert Herald newspaper, Mallam Tukur Mamu, who has been negotiating with the militants.\n\nGiving an update on the situation on Sunday, a family member of the abducted victims, who didn\u2019t want his name in print, told one of our correspondents that the terrorists were asking each family to cough up N100m ransom for the release of their loved ones.\n\nThe source said the seven victims that were released on Saturday paid an undisclosed amount.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is money that is still delaying the release of the others. The terrorists are demanding ransom now. We heard the last set paid money. They (terrorists) have reached out to us as regards the payment of ransom.\n\n\u201cThe situation now is that if you have your money, your loved ones would be freed. They have pegged the ransom at N100m. It is just unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAnother family member said they were told that the terrorists were no longer interested in negotiating with the Federal Government, saying that N100m was required to free those in captivity.\n\nHe said they were still pleading with the terrorists to reduce the ransom as some of them could not afford the huge amount.\n\nHe noted, \u201cMy loved one has not been released, those that were released paid N100m. I don\u2019t have that kind of money. The kidnappers got in touch with us. They said they were no longer negotiating with the Federal Government. Getting N100m is the dilemma many of us don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the seven persons released by the terrorists have reunited with their families on Saturday evening.\n\nThey include Bosede Olurotimi, Abubakar Zubairu, Alhassan Sule, Sadiq Abdullahi, Muhammad Paki, Aliyu Usman as well as a Pakistani, Dr. Muhammad Afzal.\n\nA victim, Sadique, who is the son of former Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University, Prof. Ango Abdullahi, broke down in tears while thanking God for regaining his freedom.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers were considerate enough to hand us over to Tukur Mamu, the lead negotiator after we insisted that we will not go with them. The most difficult job has been done by him. Alhamdulillah(Praise be to God).\n\n\u201cWe were all taken to his office and even before then, he has contacted all our family members to come and pick us up. I can confirm to you that this man did this thing alone because even our family members were taken by surprise. They least expected the rescue soon, more so, that today (Saturday) is Sallah day,\u201d Sadiq added.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to hasten efforts to ensure that the remaining 43 passengers were released as soon as possible \u201cbecause of their deteriorating health condition.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the terrorists were demanding N100m, the negotiator, Manu, told The PUNCH that the government was in a better position to answer that(question) as all the terrorists wanted as their demands had to be forwarded to the government.\n\nMamu said, \u201cI sent the list to the government but honestly, there was nothing that was done. It was as a result of that that they (terrorists) threatened this attack (on Kuje prison) and eventually they succeeded in rescuing dozens of them(terrorists) instead of only 10.\n\n\u201cI think the government should explain that because it has been communicated to the government.\u201d\n\nMamu commended the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni over what he described as his \u201cbehind the scene role\u201d in the release of the seven hostages.\n\nHe said, \u201cSincerely, I have so much respect for Governor Buni. From the information I have, there is no single Yobe citizen left in that forest but that governor demonstrated an uncommon concern on this issue.\n\n\u201cHe has been in touch with me throughout, monitoring development and even reaching out to those concerned whenever there is a need to do so.\n\n\u201cHe gave lots of support. This is a governor from the North-East far from the North-West where we have this crisis. He told me not to publicise his efforts but I had to.\u201d\n\nThe Spokesman, Department of State Service, Dr Peter Afunanya, declined comment on the terrorists\u2019 demand when contacted on the phone.\n\nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, simply said he was not aware of the negotiations with the kidnappers.\n\nThe leader of the victims\u2019 families, Dr Abdulfatai Jimoh, told one of our correspondents that after the release of the seven hostages on Saturday, 43 more hostages were still in the terrorists\u2019 den.\n\nBut a security consultant, Mr Chidi Omeje, said the nation is in a messy situation, noting that the ransom would further empower the terrorists to further their criminal enterprise.\n\nAnother analyst, Jackson Ojo queried what he described as the government\u2019s lackadaisical attitude to security issues, wondering why the security agencies cannot track down the hoodlums who are in constant communication with Mamu.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that we are in a country where miscreants called terrorists to dictate to our government.

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations.

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Monday in Daura, Katsina State revisited the issue of the prolonged strike which has left students at home for months, telling leaders of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) that enough is enough.\n\nThe president called on ASUU to reconsider their position on the continued strike, expressing worry that the hiatus will have generational consequences on families, the educational system and future development of the country.\n\nThe President, who stated this when he received some governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC), legislators and political leaders at his residence, said the strike had already taken a toll on the psychology of parents, students and other stakeholders, throwing up many moral issues that already beg for\n\nattention.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that the future of the country rests on the quality of educational institutions and education, while assuring that the government understands their position, and negotiations should continue, with students in lecture halls.\n\n\u201cWe hope that ASUU will sympathise with the people on the prolonged strike. Truly, enough is enough for keeping students at home. Don\u2019t hurt the next generation for goodness sake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president called on all well meaning Nigerians, particularly those close to the leaders and members of the association, to intervene in persuading the lecturers to reconsider their position, and the ripple effect on an entire generation and the nation.\n\nPresident Buhari said students from Nigerian universities will be faced with the challenge of competing with others in a highly connected and technology-driven work space, and keeping them at home only deprives them of time, skill and opportunities to be relevant on the global stage.\n\n\u201cColonial type education was geared towards producing workers in government. Those jobs are no longer there. Our young people should get education to prepare them for self-employment. Now education is for the sake of education.\n\n\u201cThrough technology we are much more efficient. We should encourage our children to get education, not only to look for government jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said resources should be channeled more into building infrastructure and operations of the health and educational sector, not to expand the bureaucracy to create job opportunities.\n\n\u201cBy this time next year, I would have made the most out of the two terms, and the remaining months I will do my best,\u201d the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari urged those in political positions and places of privilege to be mindful in helping the many Nigerians that were looking for opportunities.\n\n\u201cIf you are greedy, you won\u2019t look around to see what is happening with those who are less endowed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told the governors and political leaders that he had not been to his house in Daura for close to a year due to the demands of office.\n\n\u201cThe observation that I abandoned my base was made by the Emir of Daura, Dr Faruk Umar Faruk, at the eid prayer ground. He held the microphone and told everyone that the last time I was in Daura was during the Eid-el-Kabir of 2021,\u201d he added.\n\nBuhari said he would retire to Daura, not Kaduna, where he had a better house.\n\n\u201cIn ten to eleven months time, I will come here. I have a better house in Kaduna, but it is too close to Abuja,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president explained that the schedule of work was much, saying he recently had to sympathise with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, who had to be away most of the time from his family.\n\nBuhari urged the APC stalwarts to keep working for the good of the people and the country, noting that \u201c We are a lucky people, and we need to reflect more on where we are coming from.\u201d\n\nHe said relative to the resources available, and compared to the last administration, the government had done well in many areas, particularly in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI wish the person who is coming after me the very best,\u201d he said.\n\nOn security, the President said the North West had posed more challenges, and some success had been recorded in other regions, North East and South South.\n\nThe president advised some indigenes in the South South to stop hurting national assets, which also affect their livelihood.\n\n\u201cI am eager to go. I can tell you it has been tough. I am grateful to God that people appreciate the personal sacrifices we have been making,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, the Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, thanked the President for his leadership roles in improving the economy of the nation and the many successes recorded at the APC, which include two conventions to produce the party leadership and the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe will work hard to ensure the success of our party. We have reasons to work very hard,\u201d he added.\n\nBagudu, who is the Governor of Kebbi State, said the favorable seasons supported the vision of ensuring food production and making agriculture a priority, with clear results in rice pyramids in various states.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the attacks by the renegades, our country remains self-sufficient in food production. We have seen investments that were not there before you came into power.\n\n\u201cNot less than 20 states now have agriculture process zones. We have rice pyramid in Ekiti, Gombe and Niger, while maize pyramids were revived in Katsina and Kano states,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said more than 54 rice meals were commissioned in various states, and 57 fertiliser plants were revived, or built afresh.\n\n\u201cAll these were achieved because of your commitment and patriotism,\u201d the governor told the President.\n\nBagudu also appreciated the President for providing ease of access to governors and political leaders, noting that the opening of the National Economic Council for more fluid exchange of ideas greatly helped in improving the economy.",

The airport previously was the site of the UK\u2019s hottest day so far this year on 17 June when it was 32.7C.\n\nThe Met Office\u2019s extreme heat warning has only been issued twice before.\n\nLevel three heat-health alerts, which are separate to the amber alert, are in place across the south, the Midlands and eastern parts of England.\n\nBBC weather presenter Chris Fawkes earlier said that Monday had a \u201cdecent shout at being the hottest day of the year so far\u201d, as he predicted highs of 34C in eastern parts of England, including Cambridgeshire.\n\nTemperatures are set to remain high overnight going into Tuesday, making it an uncomfortable night for many.\n\nThe Met Office is advising people to stay indoors where possible and to drink plenty of fluid to cope with the heat.\n\nParents are also being encouraged to limit their children\u2019s exposure to the sun.\n\nThe heat-health alerts, issued jointly by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the Met Office, are expected to stay in place until next weekend.\n\nHeatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of climate change.\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland had their hottest days of the year so far on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, Aboyne in the Highlands hit highs of 27.5C, while Armagh reached 24.2C.\n\nSweltering temperatures are also affecting the north of England, with Manchester set to reach a high of 28C.\n\nA heatwave is sweeping across Europe, with a plume of hot air coming up from Africa and northwards through Spain.\n\nTemperatures are expected to hit 38C in Madrid and 47C in Seville on Monday.\n\nFrance, Germany and Italy could see the heat exceed 40C over the coming weekend.\n\nDr Agostinho Sousa from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has urged people to stay hydrated and try to find shade when the rays are strongest in the afternoon.\n\nThe agency said the elderly, people with underlying health conditions and those who live alone are particularly at risk.\n\nIt suggests people shade or cover windows exposed to direct sunlight, check fans and fridges are working properly, and that medicines are correctly stored.\n\nThe Met Office declares a heatwave when it records at least three days in a row with maximum temperatures exceeding a set temperature \u2013 which varies in different areas of the country.\n\nThe UK\u2019s four-level heat-health system highlights the potential health impacts of high temperatures.\n\nThe level three currently in place requires health and social care workers to pay particular attention to high-risk groups of people such as the elderly and vulnerable.\n\nTrain services were suspended between Victoria and Brixton in south London earlier when a fire broke out on tracks at Battersea Bridge.\n\nNetwork Rail believes the fire was caused by a stray spark touching the bridge\u2019s timbers.\n\nPassengers in the West Midlands are also facing disruption to some services, with an operator blaming hot tracks.\n\nHigh track temperatures meant fewer trains could run because of a speed restriction, West Midlands Railway said.\n\nHampshire County Council is preparing to deploy gritters to deal with road surfaces being melted by the sun.\n\nThe machines are normally used to tackle snow but will instead be spreading light dustings of sand to help drivers.\n\nDog owners are being advised to avoid over-exercising their pets in hot weather.\n\nBattersea Dogs and Cats Home said taking your pet for walks in the early morning or early evening when temperatures have cooled can prevent heatstroke.\n\nIt also added that dogs should never be left in parked cars when temperatures go above 21C \u2013 in a locked car this can jump to 40C.\n\nSome weather models are predicting extreme heat for the UK next weekend.\n\nBBC weather presenter Chris Fawkes said temperatures could rise to the high 30s due to hot weather across Spain and Portugal being drawn to the UK \u2013 boosting temperatures through the week and into next weekend.\n\nWeather forecasting models suggest it is possible \u2013 though not likely \u2013 temperatures in the UK on the weekend could reach 40C (104F).\n\nBut a Met Office spokeswoman said it did not believe the warmest weather would reach 40C \u2013 UK temperatures have never reached that point.\n\nBBC Weather presenter Simon King said this was a low possibility \u2013 though not impossible \u2013 and an indicator of a changing climate.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, climate scientist Ella Gilbert said heatwaves and hot spells are increasing in frequency, intensity and duration because of climate change.\n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began in the latter half of the 18th century, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n\nIn England, there were 2,500 excess deaths in the summer of 2020 as a result of hot weather, while heat-related deaths in the UK could treble in 30 years, the British Red Cross predicts.\n\nBBC",

          "title": "Ukraine War: Germany Fears Russia Gas Cut May Become Permanent",
          "text": "Russian natural gas supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 have been halted for 10 days for annual maintenance work.\n\nBut German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that EU countries had to be prepared in case gas shipments did not resume.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nHe has accused the Kremlin of using gas \u201cas a weapon\u201d in response to EU sanctions over the war in Ukraine.\n\nMr Habeck admitted Germany had become too dependent on Russian gas.\n\nHe described that as \u201ca grave political mistake as we can see today, which we are trying to remedy as quickly as we possibly can\u201d.\n\nHe said two floating terminals for deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be ready by the end of the year.\n\nIn mid-June Russia\u2019s state gas firm Gazprom cut gas flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 40% of the pipeline\u2019s capacity. It blamed a delay in the return of equipment being serviced by Germany\u2019s Siemens Energy.\n\nThe Canadian government says it will now return a repaired Siemens turbine to Germany for the pipeline. That move angered the Ukrainian government, which accused Canada of adjusting the sanctions imposed on Moscow \u201cto the whims of Russia\u201d.\n\nCanada says it is granting Siemens Canada a \u201ctime-limited and revocable permit\u201d to send repaired turbines back to Germany, despite the sanctions.\n\nGermany\u2019s government is worried that gas supplies could be reduced or cut permanently.\n\nPipeline maintenance is normal every summer, when gas demand is lower than in winter, but the worry is that Russia may not turn the taps back on.\n\nThe pipeline shutdown is also affecting Italy, where energy group Eni said it would receive about a third less gas from Russia\u2019s Gazprom on Monday compared with average volumes supplied over the past few days.\n\nThe head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has warned that Russia may cut off gas supplies to Europe entirely and that Europe needs to prepare now.\n\nRussia has already cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland over their refusal to comply with a new payment scheme.\n\nAustria and the Czech Republic get some gas from Nord Stream 1, but Russian gas also flows to them via a Ukraine pipeline.\n\nVisiting Prague, Mr Habeck signed an agreement with the Czech Republic pledging mutual help in the event of a sharp drop in Russian gas supplies.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February, Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian gas from 55% to 35% and wants to stop using gas from Russia altogether.\n\nLast year the other main suppliers of natural gas to Germany were Norway (31%) and the Netherlands (13%). Germany is now getting more gas from them, since reducing imports from Russia.\n\nThe government has also given the go-ahead for Germany\u2019s first LNG terminal to be built, at Wilhelmshaven.\n\nAnother undersea Baltic pipeline from Russia, Nord Stream 2, has been built, but plans to pump gas through it are now on hold because of the war.\n\nIf Russian supplies were suddenly cut overnight, this could tip Germany into a major recession, because entire industries rely on gas and most German homes use it for heating.\n\nA leading energy market analyst, Henning Gloystein of Eurasia Group, warned that \u201cif Nord Stream 1 doesn\u2019t come back on at all, let\u2019s say by early August, we think that the German government will have to raise its gas alert level to the third level, which is the maximum level\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat would be suspending the wholesale gas market and the government and regulator stepping in as the distributor of natural gas. So that will effectively mean rationing next winter. What happens in Germany, sadly, will spread over to the rest of Europe if it gets bad, because of the geographical location in the middle of the EU,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nGermany\u2019s gas storage facilities are currently about 64% full, German broadcaster ZDF reports.\n\nIndustry experts quoted by German media say the chemicals sector would be hardest hit by a gas shortage. It accounts for 15% of Germany\u2019s gas consumption, and disruption could lead to shortages of goods such as fertiliser, pharmaceuticals, detergent and cosmetics.\n\nGerman households and key services such as hospitals will be prioritised for gas supplies under a government emergency plan.\n\nBBC",

          "title": "Sri Lanka: First Fuel in Days Trickles Through to Residents",
          "text": "Limited fuel and gas supplies have resumed in parts of Sri Lanka after a weekend of tumultuous anti-government protests over the economic crisis.\n\nLong queues formed at filling stations and community centres across the capital, Colombo, on Monday, thronged by thousands of weary residents.\n\nFresh supplies came as a relief for a city on edge after months of shortages of fuel, food and other basics.\n\nThe financial crisis is the worst the country has seen since independence.\n\nRampant inflation has made prices soar and the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves have all but run out, leaving it struggling to import food, fuel and medicine.\n\nAnger and frustration boiled over at the weekend. Tens of thousands of protesters stormed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s official residence in Colombo on Saturday, after months of protests over his handling of the economy.\n\nCrowds also burned down the private residence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Neither man was in the buildings when they were stormed.\n\nn the Slave Island district of Colombo on Monday, hundreds of people waited for tokens they could redeem for cooking gas after a shipment of liquid petroleum gas arrived in the country on Sunday.\n\nAn endless line of empty blue gas cylinders wrapped around several tree-lined blocks of apartments. Those at the start of the queue had been waiting for hours.\n\nPerched on her gas cylinder, P Selvi Kalachelvi fished out a plastic bag of rotis or flour pancakes from her handbag. It was the only thing she was eating that day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone six months without cooking gas now. I once waited for four days for kerosene and I still didn\u2019t get anything,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\n\u201cEveryone is suffering, what can we do?\u201d\n\nCooking gas has been scarce for months, while many petrol stations had halted sales to ordinary people two weeks ago to conserve fuel for essential vehicles, bringing much of the country to a standstill.\n\nMany of those waiting in line were women, desperate to get kerosene to cook their families\u2019 meals after months of relying on chopped wood to light their fires, which they found expensive and impractical.\n\nCoupled with the soaring prices of food \u2013 some residents said the cost of chicken and beef had quadrupled since the start of the crisis \u2013 it\u2019s led most people to cut back on meals, eating only twice a day and cooking flour and vegetable dishes. Meat and fish have not been on the menu for months.\n\nThere was a stir in the crowd when police officers arrived and announced they only had enough tokens for about 1,000 families. Dozens of anxious residents trailed a policeman as he made his way down the row of cylinders, counting them one by one.\n\nHe reached the end of the line \u2013 there were enough tokens for everyone. Relief flashed across the faces of the crowd.\n\nAcross town at a Lanka IOC petrol station, soldiers and police officers directed traffic and monitored the crowds.\n\nQuarrels occasionally broke out as drivers jostled and waited in a slow-moving queue. Petrol station attendants filled their tanks while clutching thick wads of cash, as drivers forked out large sums for the fuel.\n\nOne tuk-tuk driver told the BBC he had started queueing three days ago, taking turns with his family members to keep watch over their vehicle.\n\nGayan Kalanda said he had to pay 2,500 Sri Lankan rupees ($6.90; \u00a35.80) \u2013 nearly half a day\u2019s earnings \u2013 just for five litres of petrol. It was the seventh time he\u2019d had to wait for days for petrol and he was exhausted.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t feel secure in this country. We\u2019re hungry too\u2026 we just don\u2019t have a proper life in Sri Lanka,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther back in the queue was Kanishka De Silva, a banker who had taken time off work to get fuel. On his car\u2019s dashboard was a slip of paper he had left overnight, with his phone number written on it along with the plea: \u201cPlease call if petrol comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been getting worse and worse,\u201d he said, pointing at the queue. \u201cHere we have doctors, bankers, but also tuk-tuk drivers. It\u2019s been a common battle, that\u2019s why the protests have been so strong.\n\n\u201cI work nearby, so it\u2019s fine. But lots of people live on the outskirts and it\u2019s been hard to come to work. People have been cycling or walking for hours to come in.\n\n\u201cAnd those whose livelihoods depend on having petrol, they are the ones suffering.\u201d\n\nIn late June, the authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel at state-run filling stations for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve the country\u2019s dwindling fuel stocks.\n\nThe government has been trying to secure fuel on credit from countries including Russia.\n\nIt has requested emergency financial help, blaming the Covid-19 pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka\u2019s tourist trade \u2013 one of its biggest foreign currency earners \u2013 for the crisis.\n\nHow war heroes became villains\n\nBut many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame.\n\nThe deepening economic crisis saw the president\u2019s older brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, forced to resign as prime minister in May.\n\nBoth President Rajapaksa and PM Wickremesinghe have indicated they are ready to resign, but the timetable for this to happen remains unclear. Talks are taking place between leaders of political parties aimed at resolving the crisis.\n\nThe protesters say they won\u2019t leave the presidential palace until Mr Rajapaksa resigns. His whereabouts remain unclear.\n\nBBC",
