          "text": "\u2022 Buni\u2019s panel not recognised by law, activities will be illegal \u2013 Ekiti group\n\n\u2022 We informed national secretariat about our congress, says Lagos4Lagos\n\n\u2022 Keyamo\u2019s group heads for Appeal Court against Omo-Agege\u2019s faction\n\nCrises caused by parallel state congresses of the All Progressives Congress may stall the party\u2019s national convention scheduled for December, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nAggrieved APC members in Delta, Osun, Akwa Ibom and Ekiti states, in separate interviews with The PUNCH, faulted a plan by the party\u2019s national interim committee to recognise executive councils endorsed by incumbent governors or highest political office holders in non-APC states.\n\nThey, therefore, vowed to continue with suits filed against the national interim committees as well as the ward and local government congresses.\n\nSome of the aggrieved members, particularly Ekiti State stakeholders, specifically referred to the Supreme Court judgment on the Ondo State governorship election, which they said declared the Mala Buni-led committee illegal.\n\nThe crises in the party worsened on Saturday when opposing groups organised parallel congresses in Ogun, Osun, Kwara, Lagos, Kano, and Akwa Ibom states.\n\nIn Ekiti and Delta states, APC chieftains boycotted congresses supervised by the teams sent by the national interim committee.\n\nThe PUNCH had on Monday reported that the interim committee planned to recognise congresses attended by incumbent governors in APC states and highest political office holders in non-APC states.\n\nCommenting on the development, aggrieved APC members in Ekiti State said that the legal action that they instituted against conduct of the July 31 ward congresses was suffice for the local government and state congresses as something could not stand on nothing.\n\nThe aggrieved members, under the aegis of Ekiti APC Stakeholders Forum had in August, in a suit number FHC/AD/CS/21/2021 filed at the Federal High Court, Ekiti State Division, dragged the state APC to court, calling for outright annulment of the ward congresses, which they, among others, said did not hold and a declaration that the ward congresses were \u201cunconstitutional, illegal, null and void\u201d.\n\nThe Secretary to the forum, Femi Adeleye, in an interview with one of our correspondents, said the national caretaker committee was not recognised by law.\n\nBuni\u2019s committee not recognised by law, its activities will be declared illegal \u2013 Ekiti group\n\nHe, therefore, expressed hope that the court would declare all its activities including ward, local government and state congresses illegal.\n\nAsked whether the stakeholders would go to court to stop the party\u2019s national convention, Adeleye said the suit already filed by the group against the national interim committee was all-encompassing.\n\nHe stated, \u201cYou cannot build something on nothing. What would bring about state congress would be from ward congress to local government congress and then state congress, nothing was done in the ward, nothing was done in the local, so where did they derive the state?\n\n\u201cThat is why we are in court, we went to court to say no ward congress was held. We don\u2019t need to go to court again over the exercise, which was a waste of time, we are already in court and the court is all-encompassing.\n\n\u201cEven the national caretaker is not recognised by law. When the court decides, all they have done will become a nullity.\n\n\u201cThe aggrieved party members had already gone to court on the ward congress issue and joined Mai Buni alongside. The people that went to court are those that obtained forms and wanted to contest from their various wards but were not allowed to contest.\n\n\u201cAmong others, they are in court that the national caretaker committee based on the Supreme Court pronouncement regarding Ondo State governorship election. They are in court to say that the national caretaker committee being there is illegal since it is not in the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cThey are saying that the APC constitution is very clear that you cannot be in executive position and hold party position. As governor of Yobe State, the court says that he cannot be in the party executive. One must go for the other,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough there was no parallel congress in the state, Paul Omotoso emerged the chairman at the congress attended by the state Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, but boycotted by party chieftains including a presidential aide, Babafemi Ojudu and Senator Adedayo Adeyeye.\n\nKeyamo-led group heads for appeal court\n\nIn Delta State, a group in the APC led by the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, SAN, who is also the chairman of the party\u2019s leaders\u2019 council, said it would proceed to the Court of Appeal to challenge the judgment a Federal High Court, Asaba.\n\nThe APC Secretary Delta North, Mr Victor Sorokwu, in an interview with The PUNCH, said, \u201cWe are planning to appeal the case as the court declared on Thursday last week that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter, adding that the case was an internal affairs of the party.\u201d\n\nThe group had taken the Mala Buni-led caretaker committee to the Federal High Court over the conduct of the party\u2019s congresses in the state.\n\nIt said it was not part of what it called the kangaroo congresses organised by a group loyal the Deputy President of the Senate Senator Omo-Agege, on Saturday.\n\nSorokwu warned the national interim committee against reconginising the congress organized by the Omo-Agege group.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor us in Delta, the issues surrounding the congresses in Delta are still as they were unaddressed.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, leaders of the party have agreed on consenus executive councils from ward to the state levels.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe would not recognise any other executives other than the consensus executives put together by the leaders and stakeholders. We have already in court against Buni -led caretaker committee after series of petitions.\u201d\n\nAsked if his group would approach court to seek nullification of the Osun state APC congress, Kolapo Alimi, the Legal Adviser of The Osun Progressives, a faction within Osun APC enjoying the backing of Interior Minister, Rauf Aregbesola, explained that the only case instituted by the group was against the ward congress.\n\nHe said the faction had challenged the ward congress in a suit FHC/Os/cs/38/21 pending before an Osogbo Federal High Court, expressing confidence that, if the group secured victory in the matter, its local and state congress would stand.\n\nAlimi said, \u201cWe are already in court in respect of our Ward congress. We are not challenging anything relating to the national convention. If we win that case, technically, our local government and state congress will stand.\u201d\n\nNational body should expect death of APC in Akwa Ibom, if it decision is not the best\u2014- Ewang\n\nOn his part, an APC chieftain in Akwa Ibom State and former military administrator of Ogun and Rivers states, Capt Sam Ewang (retd.), warned that the party would die in the state if best decisions were not taken.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThey are many ways of doing things and whatever the national body chooses to do should be the best and if not the best, they should expect the death of the party in the state. What I am trying to do is for the party to win elections in the state.\n\n\u201cAs the APC Elders\u2019 Forum chairman in the state, I said from the beginning that whatever decision we take should come from the elders forum at every level. If it is at the ward, the ward elders should produce the results.\n\n\u201cHowever, if this is at variance with what the national body said, the party should take responsibility. But I believe that the party will not make that mistake. They should listen to elders of the party in the state. They must listen to elders of the party in Akwa Ibom State. I am the chairman of the Elders Forum and what the elders have said is what I am standing for.\u201d\n\nStakeholders will decide our next line of action \u2013 Kwara APC faction\n\nThe Kwara State faction of the APC loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said it would submit the list of its officers to the party headquarters on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nThe Vice Chairman of the faction, Chief Sunday Oyebiyi told The PUNCH correspondent that \u201cthe report of our congress will be submitted to the national secretariat of the party tomorrow. I don\u2019t think the party will reject the report of the 22 or 23 states where parallel congress was held.\n\nAsked on the next line of action that the faction would take should if its list of executive is rejected, Oyebiyi said, \u201cIf such happens, the stakeholders would meet and decide the next line of action. \u201c\n\nWe carried nationalsecretariat along in our congress \u2013 Lagos4Lagos\n\nA group within the Lagos chapter of the APC Congress, theLagos4Lagos said it carried the national secretariat of the party along and it was aware of its recently concluded state congress.\n\nThe spokesman for the group, Mr Seun Soyinka, said this on Monday, in a chat with one of our correspondents on the phone.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn fact, everybody is aware of it. Anybody that is saying there was no parallel congress in Lagos State is just deceiving himself. Parallel congresses were held everywhere and everybody knows. I am sure the national body will settle what is going on.\u201d\n\nSoyinka added that the Lagos4Lagos congress reflected the wishes of the people as opposed to imposition of leaders.\n\nAlso the faction chairman of the APC in the state, Sunday Ajayi, who spoke with one of our correspondents, also said the national headquarters would not allow the group to leave the party.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), on Monday, in Abuja, commended the European Union for its support in the fight against human trafficking.\n\nThe Director General of the agency, Mrs Fatimah Waziri-Azi, gave the commendation at an award and speech making day organised by the International Ibero-American Foundation for Administration and Public Policies (FIIAPP).\n\nFIIAPP is a Spanish public agency implementing a project in Nigeria tagged \u201cAction Against Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants (A-TIPSOM)\u201d, aimed at eliminating human trafficking and smuggling of migrants.\n\nWaziri-Azi said that the support NAPTIP had received from the EU over the years had assisted the agency to achieve significant milestones in the fight against human trafficking.\n\nShe said that NAPTIP would forever remain grateful to FIIAPP over the A-TIPSOM project, adding that collaboration like this was a reminder that partnerships can make a difference.\n\n\u201cHuman trafficking is not only a problem, it is a crises. Empirical evidence shows that it has become the third largest criminal enterprise globally and second amongst transnational organised crime.\n\n\u201cIt is a crime in which the potential victims and allies are completely ignorant about the dangers that await them over their choices. It is portrayed by the traffickers as the best choice to end the circle of poverty in a family.\n\n\u201cIt is for these reasons that the Federal Government of Nigeria ratified all the conventions on human trafficking including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its two related protocols in 2000.\n\n\u201cIt also ratified the enactment of the trafficking in persons prohibition enforcement and administration Act 2003, as amended in 2015. The Act established NAPTIP as the specialised anti-trafficking agency with prosecutorial powers,\u201d she said.\n\nWaziri-Azi stated that NAPTIP was stepping up its efforts by applying 24 hours all hands-on-deck approach to all cases of trafficking in persons, as well as prioritising the prosecution of high profile traffickers, and enhancing the prevention of trafficking, through sustained awareness creation.\n\nShe said that the agency was in the final stages of developing the National Action Plan on Human Trafficking in Nigeria 2022-2025 with Switzerland and technical support from the United Nations Office on Drug and Crimes (UNODC) that would strengthen training of officers.\n\nShe, therefore, solicited the continued support of all stakeholders, saying that everybody had a role to play and that NAPTIP would continue to scale-up access to justice for people.\n\nOn his part, the A-TIPSOM team leader in Nigeria, Mr Rafael-Rios Molina, said that his foundation would continue supporting the federal government in the fight against human trafficking through A-TIPSOM, announcing that its official partnership with the government had been extended for additional one year.\n\nAccording to him, A-TIPSOM began in 2018, through an agreement between the EU and the Government of Nigeria, to address trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants.\n\nHe said that FIIAPP would continue to support the fight against human trafficking in Nigeria. through the support of EU.\n\nOn the award for speech making and essay competition, on trafficking, a total of 300 entries were received by FIIAPP, while award was given to three finalists from Reginal Pacis College, Abuja.\n\nThe awardees were Chidinma Nwosu, Anayo Rosemary and Ikpeme Christabel, who emerged first, second and third respectively, while others from Government Secondary School, Wuse and Tudun Wada also received awards.",

He remains a dynamic and upright personality who, despite his monumental achievements in both private and public endeavours, has remained humble to a fault.\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, mere words are ineffable to rhapsodise the depth of his being. It is safer to admit that no amount of rhetorics can convey the personality of a man who is a father, spiritual leader and mentor to me. I am so glad our paths crossed in life. It has been a relationship I will forever live to cherish. Baba is is an encourager, intercessor and God\u2019s advocate on earth.

          "title": "It\u2019s mixed fortunes over rising crude price",
          "text": "Rising oil price improves the prospects of Nigeria\u2019s budget implementation but it may also stoke inflation and increased hardship on the average Nigerian, in a delicate balancing for a country whose major export is crude oil and import is refined petroleum products.\n\nOil prices spiralled to three-year high above $85 per barrel at the weekend, driven by supply deficit forecasts and expected increase in demand over the next few months.\n\nThe economy is heavily dependent on the oil sector, which accounts for over 95 per cent of export earnings and about 40 per cent of government revenues. Recent data showed that the Nigeria\u2019s oil sector contributed about nine per cent to the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe International Energy Agency has said energy crunch is expected to boost oil demand by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), which could result in a supply gap of around 700,000 bpd through the end of this year, until the Organisation (OPEC) of the Petroleum Countries and allies, together called OPEC+, add more supply, as planned in January 2022.\n\nExperts agreed at the weekend that the global oil situation presents a mixed-fortune for Nigeria with the expected gains in higher expert earnings counterbalance by downside risks to the domestic economy, which also depends heavily on petroleum importation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) stated that Nigeria spends almost 40 per cent of its foreign exchange (forex) earnings on importation of petroleum products and petrochemicals.\n\nFinance and economic analysts at the weekend pointed out the subtle threat of imported inflation due to weak currency and rising consumer prices, despite the continuing decline in inflation rate. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) at the weekend released its September 2021 Consumer Price Index (CPI) showing that headline inflation rate moderated for the sixth consecutive month to 16.6 per cent last month as against 17.01 per cent in August, this year.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe decline in the headline inflation rate was meanwhile driven by 74 basis points decline in food inflation rate to 19.6 per cent. A month-on-month breakdown however showed that headline inflation rate inched up by 13 basis points from 1.02 per cent in August to 1.15 per cent last month.\n\nThe positive global outlook for crude oil reinforces Nigeria\u2019s medium term expenditure and economic development plan. Nigeria\u2019s 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP), which provide the framework for yearly budgets, pegged daily crude oil production at 1.88mbpd; 2.23mbpd and 2.22mbpd for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively. The benchmark crude oil price for national planning is set conservatively at around at $57 per barrel, providing headroom for excess crude accounts.\n\nSenior Research Analyst, FXTM, Mr. Lukman Otunuga, said the explosive appreciation in oil is double-edged as bad news for energy consumers and a welcome development for energy-producing countries. But in the case of Nigeria, it comes with a complication as government fixes the price of gasoline for consumers below the international prices and uses its own funds to pay for the difference.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cOne thing to keep in mind is that Nigeria exports crude by imports all by-products of the resource, including the most premium motor spirit. With Africa\u2019s largest economy consuming more than its refineries can produce, it depends heavily on importation for its energy needs which has recently jumped to over 70 million litres per day.\n\n\u201cIronically, rising international oil prices will put more pressure on the country\u2019s foreign exchange while the revenues from oil sales may be drained by the fuel subsidies. According to data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the cost of petrol subsidies may hit N1 trillion by December if oil prices continue to rally. This will impact the government\u2019s ability to fulfil its financial obligations and may even impact the recently approved 2022 budget,\u201d Otunuga said.\n\nAccording to him, higher petrol prices have fueled fears over rising inflation which could hit disposable income and impact economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe horrible combination of rising inflation and slowing growth continues to fan concerns over stagflation. Removing fuel subsidies is likely to expose Nigeria to such risks. Another question is the socioeconomic consequences of such a move. If Nigeria had a chance to remove the subsidies, this could have been when oil prices trading at record lows last year. Fast forward today, oil bulls are on a tear with the fundamentals propelling prices towards $100 \u2013 a level not seen since 2014. To remove the subsidies now, may result in spiralling inflation but keeping them active continues to drain the government coffers,\u201d Otunuga added.\n\nAnalysts at Afrinvest Securities at the weekend said though they expected the headline inflation rate to further moderate this month to 16.0 per cent on high base-year effect, \u201crisks to the outlook include further increase in the cost of energy commodities-noticeably, diesel and gas, and renewed pressure on the exchange rate\u201d.\n\nCowry Asset Management Limited had noted that the \u201csustained rise in month-on-month inflation was partly due to sustained foreign exchange volatility; thus impacting input costs of businesses which was passed onto consumers in the form of higher selling prices\u201d.\n\n\u201cHence, we feel that annual inflaition rate may rise in the coming months, especially during the festive season, although to a limited extent due to expected increase in food supply on account of the ongoing harvest season,\u201d Cowry Asset stated.\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital said while they expected food prices to moderate this month, given the impact of the primary harvest season, the impact of currency weakening and higher transportation costs may stoke upward pressures in the core basket.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we look for month-on-month headline inflation reading of 1.27 per cent in October, with the high base effect from the corresponding period of 2020 translating to 30 basis points moderation in yearly headline inflation to 16.32 per cent,\u201d Cordros Capital stated.\n\nBismarck Rewane\u2019s Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) stated that the principal inflation moderating factor was the base year effects, pointing out that a notable trend however was that core inflation-inflation less seasonalities increased by 0.33 per cent to 13.74 per cent while month-on-month inflation also increased.\n\ning sold at N350 per litre and commodity prices are surging? When will the domestic inflation rate finally reach an inflection point? These are some of the pertinent questions on the mind of most analysts and investors,\u201d FDC stated.",

          "text": "The World Bank Group (WBG) has assessed its $157 billion support given to Nigeria and other developing economies to fight COVID-19 pandemic. Nigeria got $3.4 billion support from the bank in May to strengthen the economy and support recovery from the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking to the bank\u2019s development committee at the end of the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Meetings held in the United States, World Bank President, David Malpass, said from April 2020 through June 2021, the multilateral institution committed more than $157 billion, the largest crisis response and fastest growth in its history.\n\n\u201cOur support for the poorest countries is at an all-time high, including grants and highly concessional loans to countries eligible to borrow from International Development Association (IDA).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cOn COVID-19 and vaccines, we worked closely with the Board to develop and implement a fast-track approach that has helped nearly 150 countries tackle the health emergency. We\u2019re providing financing for COVID-19 vaccines in 61 countries and currently have 250 million doses under contract with World Bank financing. We\u2019re pleased to partner with COVAX, AVAT, the African Union, and UNICEF on our shared priority to accelerate the purchase and deployment of vaccines in developing countries,\u201d Malpass said.\n\nThe G20, working the IMF, created the Common Framework, that focused on debt transparency and sustainability, debt reconciliation, and a sense of speed.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMalpass said the International Debt Statistics \u2013 IDS \u2013 report, which was just released on Monday, shows that low-income country debt rose 12 per cent to a record $860 billion.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThere remain huge amounts of work to be done to achieve debt sustainability and transparency. He said the World Bank has generated vital reports that are important additions to the knowledge base, including Global Economic Prospects (GEP), Global Waves of Debt, and an upcoming flagship report on debt transparency.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNow is the time for countries and people to be detailed and look for solutions on debt.\n\nOn climate, Malpass said the bank outlined a powerful new path forward using the World Bank Group\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) for 2021-2025.\n\n\u201cThe CCAP focuses on integrating climate and results, achieving the maximum impact from climate finance, and improved diagnostics and data. The way to achieve impact is to prioritize interventions; create a just transition from coal; and focus on adaptation. The CCAP does these through diagnostics and work with the IMF and other partners on climate action,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had extensive discussions this week, and indeed this year, on these challenges. This week, I\u2019ve participated in lengthy discussions in the G24, G20, G7, and IMFC, with G20 Leaders on Afghanistan, the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, and others, and I met with many finance ministers.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach of the discussions focused on problems and possible solutions, but I\u2019m afraid that progress is still slow. The reality is that there\u2019s been a stark reversal of development gains. Development is going backwards on poverty, median income, education, nutrition, security and many other areas. A failure to address these would leave us with a decade of regrets,\u201d he said.\n\nMalpass said the COVID-19 crisis has affected every aspect of commercial and social activity. \u201cDeveloping countries have made extraordinary efforts to keep economic activity going during the pandemic, but they face grave challenges: climate change, debt, inequality, and vulnerabilities to future shocks. Per capita income is expected to grow nearly five per cent in advanced economies in 2021, but only 0.5 per cent in low-income countries,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Some residents of the South East Zone of the country have vowed to resort to firewood and charcoal if prices of cooking gas continue to soar.\n\nThe consumers told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in separate interviews that they could no longer cope with the situation as it was taking a toll on their lives.\n\nThey called on the Federal Government to address the current hike in the price of cooking gas to ease the sufferings on the people.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNAN check in some gas plants in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo States showed that the price of cooking gas had increased by more than 50 per cent.\n\nNAN reports that a 12.5kg cylinder which was sold for N6,800 in September, had increased to between N7,800 and N8,000 depending on locations.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was also observed that a 6kg cylinder, that previously sold for N2,900, had gone up to N4200 in less than a month.\n\nA manager of one of the gas plants in Awka, who pleaded anonymity told NAN that the hike was as a result of the current devaluation of the naira.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cYou know gas is refined and imported into the country, therefore, the price is dominated by the dollar. So, the more the naira is devalued, the higher the prices will continue to rise,\u201d he said.\n\nSome consumers, who spoke to NAN separately, blamed the government for its inability to control the price of cooking gas in the open market.\n\nA resident of a gas plant in Awka, who identified himself as Mr Smart Okongi, said that the continued rise in the price of cooking gas was alarming adding that the increase was being felt by many Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs a civil servant with no increment in salary, it is now becoming very difficult keeping up with the everyday rise in prices of food stuff, transportation, rent and now cooking gas.\n\n\u201cThis development is sad because our country is endowed with natural gas. I also blame the Federal government for its inability to control the price in the open market.\n\n\u201dI appeal to the government to reduce or have a fixed price for cooking gas to alleviate our sufferings,\u201d Okongi said.\n\nAnother resident, Mrs Helen Aniaso, a caterer, said that the daily rise in price of cooking gas was impacting on her business negatively.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating because for every time we go to refill, the price increases. It is affecting my business in terms of productivity and profit.\n\n\u201cWe have increased the prices of the food we sell just to meet up, but we are loosing customers because many of them cannot afford to pay.\n\n\u201cIt is not also cheaper resorting to kerosene, charcoal, or firewood because their prices too have increased.\n\n\u201cThe government should come to our aid before our sources of livelihood collapse, \u201d she said.\n\nMr Adolphus Egwu, a businessman in Onitsha, expressed fears that the price of 12.5kg gas cylinder might increase to N10,000 by December if the government did not act quickly.\n\n\u201cThis practice of gas sellers is highly unfair to users, considering the economic situation in the country. Because of this hike, a plate of food rose from about N400 or N500 to N800 or N1,000?\n\n\u201cI appeal to the relevant regulatory agencies, to halt this practice by monitoring and checking the excesses of the sellers,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a similar situation in all the states in the zone as consumers groan over the rising cost of cooking gas.\n\nSome gas dealers in the zone blamed the development to increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) to the petroleum products, high demand of gas and naira devaluation.\n\nAccording to an Umuahia resident in Abia, I now use charcoal as an alternative because a 7kg of gas that I used to refill with less than N2000 now goes for over N4,000, that is at the rate of N640 per kg.\n\nA financial expert, Mr Timothy Okoroafor, said the inflation rate posed a serious challenge and was largely responsible for increased spending on food items and cooking gas.\n\n\u201cWhat do you expect when we are only consuming and not producing as a nation?\n\n\u201cThe monetary and other fiscal policies of the government do not help matters.\n\n\u201cThere is also no price control.\n\n\u201cOur government should come up with some interventions and provide an enabling environment for industries to thrive,\u201d Okoroafor said.\n\nOn high cost of food items, Mr Jerry Okenwa, who sells food items at Isigate, said the prices of food would continue to soar because the local production could meet the ever increasing demand.\n\nAccording to him, the problem of insecurity in the country, which affected farming, coupled with the border closure, has contributed majorly to the high cost of food items.\n\nOkenwa said: \u201cThe farmers are afraid to go to farm because of fear of attacks, so the ones available are not enough for our large population.\n\n\u201cOur local production is not enough, while the border is not open for importation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThe cost of transportation of the food items has also increased by 100 per cent.\n\n\u201cSince the cost of transporting the items from the north to this place (Abia) has increased, one has to sell according to how one buys, in order to cover cost and make some profit.\u201d\n\nSome market men and women in the zone, while expressing their grievances, attributed the high increase in the prices of foodstuffs to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOthers attributed the hike to increase in transport fares and the inability of farmers to produce enough food for domestic consumption as a result of insecurity in the country.\n\nSome of the major foodstuffs affected by the price hike, as confirmed by NAN, include rice, beans, tomato, pepper, palm oil, onions, egg, plantain, garri, spaghetti, yam, soup sauces such as Egusi, Ogbono and cocoyam.\n\nEven the prices of bread, table and satchet water, soft drinks and many other edibles have increased.\n\nMrs Joy Ekeh, a petty trader, said that the hike in food prices was alarming.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago, I bought a bottle of palm oil at the rate of N800 but today I just bought for N1,400, same goes for other commodities.\n\n\u201cIncrease in the prices of food items is getting worse by the day and that should not be. The government\u2019s agency in charge of price regulation should do something about this,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Agnes Madu, a business woman, noted that a tuber of yam that was sold for N700 to N800 had gone up to N1,200 to N1,300, adding that she could no longer afford to buy more than one.\n\n\u201cNot just yam, even the prices of beans and garri have all increased. A cup of Egusi as of August was N120 but now it is sold at the cost of N250 to N300.\n\n\u201cIf care is not taken, the poor will find it hard to feed if things continued at that rate, \u201d she said .\n\nOne Mr Angus Eleweke, a civil servant, called on the state and federal government to urgently address the situation before things get out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe cannot blame the traders; there are a number of factors for food prices inflation.\n\nOne of them is the issue of security. Some of the areas where foods come from have been subjected to banditry and insecurity.\n\n\u201cFarmers out of fear for their lives have not been going to the farm. This contributes to the price increases we are witnessing.\n\n\u201cAs traders complain, so do buyers. The soaring prices of food stuffs are frustrating many families with limited budgets,\u201d Eleweke said.\n\nMrs Agnes Ebeke, a Customer described the rise in cooking gas and food prices as artificial inflation.\n\nEbeke added that average Nigerian family was finding it difficult to buy the product between N680 and N800 at its current price per kilogramme in some gas plants and outlets.\n\nShe said that the steady increase in the items were disturbing and could continue if not checked.\n\n\u201cGas outlets sell the product higher than the gas plants,\u201d Ebeke said.\n\nMr Chiwe Ogbonna, cooking gas user at Hariz Gas Plant limited, explained that price of LPG has been on steady rise since January 2021.\n\nOgbonna expressed concern that the commodity was getting beyond the reach of the average citizen.\n\nIn Ebonyi, residents appealed to relevant stakeholders to address the worsening economic down turn and reverse inflationary trend that caused hike in prices of essential commodities in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, an attendant at the Lopa gas station who spoke on condition of anonymity, alleged that gas price was not determined by the stations but according to price fixed by regulatory agencies.\n\nMrs Stella Onu and Nwamaka Ugwu Consumers while making their purchases, described the situation as unacceptable and called on relevant authorities to urgently take necessary step to reverse the price hike.\n\nMr Evans Chika, at the Margaret Umahi International Market said a bag of crayfish is sold between N75, 000 and N70, 000 as against N45, 000 and N50, 000 sold in September.\n\n\u201cA painter of crayfish is sold between N3, 000 and N3, 500 currently. The cost is getting higher gradually,\u201d they said.\n\nAnother Customer and civil servant, Mrs Amara Ezeoketa, lamented that buying food items at its current price with a salary of less than N50,000 a month was becoming difficult for her and other families as well.\n\nEzeoketa disclosed that a bag of onion now cost between N60, 000 and N55, 000 as against N18, 000 and N25, 00 in August 2021.\n\n\u201cNow a painter of beans is sold between N2, 400 and N2, 800 depending on the brand.\n\n\u201cA bottle of palm oil is now sold at N800, and a litre of groundnut oil sold between N1, 200 and N1, 500 depending on the brand.\n\n\u201cThe increase also affects other items like, floor, beverages, soft drinks, toiletries, tailoring materials among others,\u201d Ezeoketa said.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja, Okey Sampson, Umuahia, Paul Orude Bauchi, Laide Raheem, Abeokuta, Lateef Dada, Osogbo, Rose Ejembi, Makurdi\n\nThe much-postponed state congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held last weekend has further polarised the ruling party as confusion, parallel leadership and multiple chairmen emerged in many states.\n\nTwo days after the exercise, bickering and rancour have persisted in Akwa Ibom, Kano, Bauchi, Kwara, Rivers, Niger, Osun, Delta and in almost all the South-East states as they have either two or more factional chairmen to contend with.\n\nIn Ogun State, faction loyal to Governor Dapo Abiodun has threatened to expel former governor, Senator Ibikunle Amonsun.\n\nSources from states rocked by crisis said while the situation during the congresses degenerated to shooting of guns, others though peaceful produced multiple leaderships.\n\nIn Abia, Enyi Harbor and Acho Obioma, emerged chairmen in parallel congresses. Harbor was returned as consensus chairman in the Chief Ikechi Emenike-led faction, while Chidi Abuaja emerged as state party secretary.\n\nObinna Atuonwu was announced as organising secretary and Okey Ezeala publicity secretary among others, who emerged from a consensus exercise held at Chidiebere Park Ugwunchara Umuahia opposite Holy Rosary Girls Secondary school.\n\nIn the other faction led by chairman, APC caretaker committee, Chief Donatus Nwamkpa, held at Umuahia Township stadium, Obioma polled 298 votes to defeat Sylvanus Nwaji who got one vote, Dike Nwankwo, four, Chidi Nwosu, 92 and Ikechukwu Ukaegbu 134 while there were 24 voided votes.\n\nIn Bauchi, opposing factions loyal to former speaker, Yakubu Dogara and minister of education, Malam Adamu Adamu, are at loggerheads following allegations of imposition of party officials.\n\nA faction of the party has asked Mai Mala Buni, Governor of Yobe State and National Chairman of the party to perish the idea of imposing candidates by \u201cpowerful Abuja\u201d politicians.\n\nChairman of the stakeholders committee from Bauchi South Senatorial district, Adamu S. Noma, who addressed the media at the NUJ Secretariat, yesterday, appealed to the national leadership of the party to recognise Sanusi Aliyu Kunde, who it claimed was unanimously endorsed by stakeholders from the state.\n\nNoma said Kunde was the choice of the APC and that the seven member committee headed by Jibriln Sam never conducted any congress nor elected Babayo Aliyu Misau as chairman. He alleged that the so-called congress that returned Misau done in Abuja was abnormal.\n\nThey alleged that members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had infiltrated APC and assured that the new leadership led by Kunde would bring sanity to the party.\n\nIn Enugu, former commissioner for works, Chief Ugo Agballah and former vice chairman of the party, Adolphus Ude, emerged in parallel congresses. But the issue was, however, compounded as former military administrator of Gombe State and chieftain of the party, Group Capt. Joe Orji (retd) said he was the \u2018consensus chairman designate\u2019 of the APC in the state.\n\nThe faction of former senate president, Ken Nnamani, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and ex-governor Sullivan Chime, produced Agballlah, while that loyal to outgone state chairman, Dr. Ben Nwoye, Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu and consisting of the foundation members of APC in the state elected Ude.\n\nUde, in his acceptance speech, said as progressives, promoting equity, natural justice and prosperity was their watchword. He wondered how some persons wanted to foist Agballah, who he claimed had not been publicly admitted into the party as its state chairman.\n\nHe also alleged that the same leaders who recruited Agballah had earlier recruited Rev. Okey Ogbodo to factionalise the party, resulting in APC\u2019s woeful performance in 2019 general elections in Enugu State.\n\nBut Agballah said his victory marked a new beginning for the party in the state and the party\u2019s journey to Government House and promised to unite all members of the party in the state by providing committed and selfless leadership.\n\nOrji described news relating to the emergence of any other candidate as fake.\n\n\u201cI was actually the consensus candidate of Enugu APC stakeholders at a meeting convened by former Senate President and representative of the South East in the National Caretaker Committee of the party. In that meeting representing the three senatorial districts, they settled for me. So, I am the consensus chairman designate. Anything to the contrary won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nIn Ogun State, Senator Amosun, risks another suspension from the party following the conduct of a parallel congress, a source said.\n\nAmosun had in 2019 been suspended by the national headquarters of the party for working for the Allied People\u2019s Movement (APM) candidate, Abdulkabir Akinlade against the APC candidate and incumbent governor, Dapo Abiodun.\n\nLoyalists of the former governor had converged at the Alake\u2019s Palace to elect their state officials for Ogun State.\n\nThe congress produced Derin Adebiyi, Jide Ojuko and Toyin Adesiyan as chairman, deputy chairman and secretary, respectively.\n\nPandemonium, however, erupted at the congress venue as hoodlums temporarily disrupted proceedings before the situation was brought under control by the police and other security agencies on ground.\n\nA source claimed the national leadership of the party in Abuja had issued a query to the former governor on the chaos which emanated as a result of the parallel congress by his loyalists. But this could not be confirmed at at press time.\n\nIn Benue State, congress of the APC ended in the early hours of Sunday with the emergence of Austin Agada as chairman.\n\nAgada polled 1, 385 votes out of the votes from 1,500 delegates, while his co-contestant, Omale Omale who boycotted the election was said to have polled 27 votes.\n\nHowever, some leaders from Benue South Senatorial District popularly known as Zone \u2018C\u2019 has rejected what they described as unfair and unjust accreditation of delegates by the state congress committee.\n\nThe leaders include former senate president, Ameh Ebute and former minister of agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh.\n\nThe aggrieved leaders in a petition to the Abubakar Mohammed Luggawero-led Committee, insisted that list of delegates generated in Benue South and given to the committee was not genuine, hence unacceptable.\n\nIn Osun State, the committee for the state congress, however, said there was no parallel congress in Osogbo, except funeral or marriage ceremony.\n\nChairman of the National Committee for Osun Congress, Gbenga Elegbeleye, said any other congress apart from the one held at the Osogbo City Stadium was a \u201cmere funeral ceremony.\u201d\n\nElegbeleye, at a news conference, yesterday, at the party\u2019s secretariat in Osogbo, said the committee was not aware of any parallel congress in the state as being speculated. A faction within the party,The Osun Progressives (TOP), loyal to former Governor Rauf Aregbesola, held a parallel congress on Saturday, while the Ileri Oluwa group, loyal to Governor Gboyega Oyatola, held its congress at the Osogbo City Stadium, where the immediate caretaker chairman of the party, Mr Gboyega Famodun, was re-elected as chairman.\n\nTOP, at a parallel congress, elected the immediate secretary of the party, Alhaji Rasak Salinsile, as its chairman.\n\nElegbeleye, who described the insinuations of parallel congress in the state as a fallacy, said on no account could any congress be held outside the knowledge of the committee, as prescribed by the party\u2019s principles and guidelines.\n\nIn Adamawa, no fewer than 12 local government areas had voted as the congress election continued for the second day, yesterday.\n\nProf. Umar Katsayal, chairman of the election committee, attributed the delay of the election to intensive and thorough screening of delegates.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of the election is moving smoothly according to the party\u2019s rules and regulations,\u201d Adamu said.\n\nReacting to the crisis, National Secretary APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, reiterated the resolve of the party leadership to come hard on any person or group behind the emergence of any parallel leadership in any state.\n\n\u201cWe successfully concluded the first and second congresses in the wards and local governments by observing all the laid down rules and regulations, including satisfying the requirements of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). We, therefore want to sound a note of warning again that any congress outside what we have endorsed is an effort in futility. All we want to appeal to them is to respect the constituted authority by exploring the Appeal Committee option when we set it up. Again, we have a listening chairman who can attend to any kind of complaint from anybody. They don\u2019t need to bring the party down because of their selfish interests. It is not done that way. In any case, we don\u2019t want to overrate ourselves, otherwise I will say that we achieved 99 per cent successes in the three congresses we have conducted so far.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Only six African nations have combined LPG storage capacity greater than 50,000MT.\u201d\n\nThis was even as the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM), Mr. Bassey Essien, disclosed that over one million metric tonnes of gas were consumed by Nigerians in 2020, with about 65 per cent of the product imported by marketers.\n\n\u2018\u2018The shortfall is made up through importation. The implication is that the importers will embed expenses incurred into the price it sells LPG to marketers at the depots and terminals. This is then passed on to the end users of the product,\u2019\u2019 Essien said.\n\nBut to reverse the lagging LPG consumption figure for Africa, Shonubi disclosed that Sahara Group, will invest over $1 billion to enhance access to LPG in Africa and emerging economies in a bid to boost energy transition on the continent.\n\nShonubi attributed the low LPG consumption in Africa to the hurdle of affordability, absence of large-scale LPG storage infrastructure, minimal vessels dedicated to the region, low set-up cost of firewood and kerosene stoves, as well as negative perceptions and fear of explosions due to poor safety standards, among other factors.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "SERAP sues Buhari over plan to monitor WhatsApp messages",
          "text": "Socio\u2013Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari, asking the court to declare illegal and unconstitutional plan by the administration to track, intercept and monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages of Nigerians and other people, as it severely threatens and violates the right to the preservation of privacy.\n\nThe suit followed the proposal in the Supplementary Appropriation Act signed in July 2021 to spend N4.87 billion to monitor private calls and messages. The amount is part of the N895.8billion supplementary budget approved by the National Assembly.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1240/2021 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking an order of perpetual injunction restraining President Buhari and any other authority, persons or group of persons from unlawfully monitoring the WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people.\n\nSERAP is also seeking a declaration that any monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is oppressive and draconian, as it threatens and violates sections 37 and 39 of Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended); Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part: \u201cThe plan to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is an arbitrary interference by the administration into respect for family and private life, the home, and correspondence. It also fails to meet the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality. The Buhari administration has legal obligations to protect Nigerians and other people against arbitrary interference and violations of their human rights. Monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages would grant free rein to government agencies to conduct mass surveillance of communications of people. The mere threat of mass surveillance, even when secret, coupled with the lack of remedy, can constitute an interference with human rights, including the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. Privacy and expression are intertwined in the digital age, with online privacy serving as a gateway to secure exercise of the freedom of opinion and expression. Therefore, targets of surveillance would suffer interference with their rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and expression whether the effort to monitor is successful or not.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as respondents are Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami and Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed.\n\n\u201cThe powers to conduct arbitrary, abusive or unlawful surveillance of communications may also be used to target political figures and activists, journalists and others in the discharge of their lawful activities. Any spending of public funds should stay within the limits of constitutional responsibilities, and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy. The lack of any safeguards against discriminatory decision-making, and access to an effective remedy shows the grave threats the purported plan poses to constitutionally and internationally recognised human rights.\n\n\u201cSection 37 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide for the right to freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy and correspondence, communications and private data. Section 39 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 19 of the Covenant also guarantee the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any media. The UN General Assembly has condemned unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and interception of communications as \u2018highly intrusive acts\u2019 that interfere with fundamental human rights (see General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 71/199). Interference with privacy through targeted surveillance is designed to repress the exercise of the right to freedom of expression. Surveillance of journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others simply exercising their right to freedom of expression \u2013 would lead to violations of other human rights. Targeted surveillance creates incentives for self-censorship and directly undermines the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to conduct investigations and build and maintain relationships with sources of information.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*Criminal gangs flush with ransom money, extorting governments\n\n*Farmers sell land to free their children, incidence fuelling inflation\n\n*NAF describes allegation of payments to bandits as \u2018fake news\u2019\n\nUgo Aliogo with agency report\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has described how the Nigerian military paid cash to buy back an anti-aircraft gun that posed a threat to President Muhammadu Buhari, who flew through the endangered airspace to his hometown, some 80 miles away.\n\nThe report alleged that kidnapping gangs that encamped in Nigeria\u2019s Rugu forest had seized the anti-aircraft gun during a clash with a military unit. It stated that the ransom, almost $50,000 in crisp Nigerian bank notes, was paid to retrieve the weapon.\n\nSoldiers, intelligence officers, and mediators, who had visited the kidnapping camps, described a surfeit of munitions, which included more anti-aircraft guns acquired since the mission to buy one back.\n\nBut the Nigerian Air Force, in a statement, described the report that it made such payment to armed bandits as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State (and) other parts of the North-west,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt said despite the allegation, NAF conducted air interdiction in the area recently.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe attention of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has been drawn to reports alleging that the NAF, through one of its personnel, paid the sum of N20 million to armed bandits operating in Jibia Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State in exchange for an anti-aircraft gun allegedly seized.\n\n\u201cThe report went on to state that the reason behind the payment was to retrieve the anti-aircraft gun which, it alleged, the NAF feared could be used against aircraft operating within Katsina State.\u201d\n\nNAF said there was no iota of truth in the allegation, adding that it is designed to cast aspersion on the service.\n\nIt alleged, \u201cThe said report is totally false. It should therefore be taken as fake news and disregarded. Indeed, we ordinarily would not have responded to such baseless and utterly illogical allegation but for the need to set the record straight as well as reaffirm the NAF\u2019s unflinching commitment to decisively dealing with the armed bandits and all other criminal elements.\u201d\n\nNAF stated further, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, it must be stated that there is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State, other parts of the North-west as well as other Theatres of Operation in the country.\u201d\n\nHowever, the federal government did not respond to THISDAY\u2019s request for comments.\n\nBut the foreign journal maintained, \u201cCriminal factions appear to be better equipped with larger-capacity advanced weaponry than national security agencies,\u201d quoting a confidential internal report presented to the president in July.\n\nWSJ further alleged that over several months, the militant leader had agreed to part with the truck-mounted 12.7 millimetre anti-aircraft gun in exchange for the ransom.\n\n\u201cHis men had plenty more munitions,\u201d he was quoted to have said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the army\u2019s weapons,\u201d according to an officer, whose account was corroborated by another senior Nigerian official involved in the previously undisclosed mission, the report said.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t pay, we kill them,\u201d a militant leader in Zamfara State, Shehu Rekeb, was quoted to have said in a phone interview.\n\nHis men were herdsmen, he said, who had been mistreated by the state and subjected to arbitrary arrests.\n\nOnce armed with machetes, they now have weapons on par with the military and collaborators inside the army, he was quoted to have claimed.\n\nMore so, the report disclosed that in forests in the North-west, the loosely organised criminal gangs that raised funds by kidnapping school children were now flush with arms, cash and operating beyond the reach of an increasingly fragile state.\n\nIn some instances, government officials in Africa\u2019s most populous nation have been paying the gangs to return stolen weapons and kidnapped personnel, WSJ said, citing confidential documents and interviews with senior military officials, soldiers and independent mediators, and one of the gang leaders.\n\nThe New York-based newspaper narrated how during one of the incidents, masked men emerged from the forest on motorbikes, surrounding a young intelligence officer clutching a cash-filled bag.\n\nIt said, \u201cAn hour later, the officer, who declined to be identified, was clasping hands with a leader of a diffuse network of criminals, whose campaign of kidnapping civilians\u2014including hundreds of schoolchildren\u2014has raised millions of dollars to build an arsenal of heavy weaponry they are using to wrest control of swaths of the north, including the president\u2019s home state.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s government\u2014still battling Islamic State militants in the North-east\u2014refers to the lesser-known criminal groups in its North-west as \u201cbandits\u201d, the WSJ report said.\n\nIt said several senior security officials described mass kidnapping for ransom as the country\u2019s primary new security crisis.\n\nThe report said one official, who had reviewed intercepts of bandit leaders\u2019 communications, described how the militants spoke of accumulating weapons to defend themselves from rival gangs and from government-backed vigilantes and to conduct increasingly brazen operations against schools, villages, state officials and each other.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re settling scores\u2026government cannot do anything,\u201d one senior government security said.\n\nThe bandits have seized more than 1,000 children from their schools this year. Thousands of schools have closed in a country, where half the population is under 18 and which has become home to the world\u2019s largest population of out-of-class children\n\nFarmers have abandoned their land or sold it to purchase their children\u2019s freedom, sending the price of corn, rice and beans to new highs. Hundreds of villages have been deserted, after fighting that has left a quarter of a million people homeless.\n\n\u201cMy son has been captive in the forest for months,\u201d said Bulus Kwoi, whose firstborn was one of 140 students abducted from Bethel Baptist School in Kaduna in July. \u201cPlease, will you give us the money to free them?\u201d he appealed.\n\nMost of the bandits are from the Fulani ethnic group, a traditionally cattle-rearing society, whose herdsmen have been fighting for years with farmers over access to dwindling grazing lands.\n\nThe report also alleged that more recently, some herdsmen had reorganised into kidnapping gangs, seizing everyone from villagers to prominent politicians.\n\nLast month, bandits raided a military training college in Kaduna State, north of the capital, killing two soldiers, grabbing more weaponry and kidnapping a ranking military officer, a major at the country\u2019s national defense academy.\n\nConfident that they hold the upper hand, the bandits have called in to talk radio stations to boast of their weaponry and have invited journalists to photograph their stockpiles, WSJ reported.\n\nThe Nigerian Police last month said they arrested three suspects in the kidnapping of students from Bethel Baptist School in Kaduna State.\n\nIn the past three months, bandits have been blamed for abducting political leaders and Catholic priests, and for regular killings of policemen. In July, the air force said a pilot was shot down over the Rugu forest after attempting an airstrike on bandit encampments there.\n\nThe report said bandits were a distant priority for United States policy makers focused on Nigeria\u2019s jihadist threat, though American officials said they had intercepted calls from suspected Islamist militants in the North-east, who were advising bandits in the North-west on kidnapping operations and negotiations.\n\nThe Nigerian military opened a new offensive last month, bombarding forest encampments with airstrikes from US-delivered jet fighters. The government ordered cell phone reception suspended across four states, cutting off tens of millions of residents, as part of a military offensive that some officials claimed was succeeding.\n\nVillagers have paid bandits to not kidnap their children, intensifying a protection racket. Unable to defend communities, the governors of three northern states have told citizens to pick up weapons, fuelling a local business of fashioning muskets from scrap metal.\n\n\u201cHardly a day passes by without a person being killed or kidnapped. No single day,\u201d Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari, had said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the people to rise up,\u201d he added.\n\nWSJ reported that the mission to buy back the anti-aircraft gun began with a handoff from a high-ranking air force intelligence officer in Abuja: a black zip-up bag he alleged was full of N20 million.\n\nIt was given to the young intelligence officer tapped to exchange it for the anti-aircraft gun the bandits had seized in an area, where Buhari frequently flew to visit his hometown of Daura.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThe officer flew to the town of Jibia on the border with Niger, where a dozen armed men emerged from the forest to meet him. They escorted him on motorbikes into thickening forest for hours, arriving at the home of their leader, a wiry man in his 30s, who collected the sack.\n\n\u201cWhile the bandits began disassembling the antiaircraft gun and attempting to strap it to a wobbling motorbike, their leader aired a series of grievances against the state: Vigilantes had kidnapped his father, young men could no longer earn a livelihood rearing cattle, and airstrikes were killing civilians in his camps. \u201cYou are bombing us from the air,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are killing our children.\u201d\n\nHis fighters were conducting reprisal operations against vigilantes and the army, which had helped them accrue a huge weapons stockpile, he said.\n\nEventually, WSJ said, the bandits strapped the antiaircraft gun across two motorbikes and began to wheel it out of the camp. \u201cThey made it look so simple,\u201d the air force officer said. \u201cThey made it feel casual.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Pledges continuous support in fighting insecurity\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi\n\nThe United States Government has described the humanitarian crisis in Nigeria\u2019s North-east as one of the world\u2019s most challenging and complex. U.S Consulate Public Affairs Officer, Stephen Ibelli, disclosed this at the Nigeria Info 99.3 FM \u201cSecurity and Development Summit\u201d, during a session on \u201cUS and Nigeria Security Assistance and Cooperation\u201d.\n\nThe summit was in commemoration of the radio station\u2019s 10th anniversary.\n\nIbelli pledged the U.S. government\u2019s continuous support to Nigeria in the fight against insecurity. He said estimates by the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think-tank, showed that more than 350,000 people had been killed in the North-east since 2009, while about three million people had been displaced across the Lake Chad Basin region.\n\nIbelli further said the trail of death, destruction, and personal losses inflicted by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa was immeasurable. He said the North-west also faced the threat of banditry, a type of organised crime that included kidnapping, armed robbery, murder, rape, cattle-rustling, and the exploitation of environmental resources.\n\nAccording to the envoy,\n\n\u201cThese armed groups have terrorised communities, killed and displaced thousands, hindered socio-economic development, and threatened democratic governance.\n\n\u201cThere is also the farmer-herder conflict worsened by climate change, rising populations, and competition for dwindling resources.\n\n\u201cDisagreements between pastoralist and farmers that may have once seemed manageable and isolated have escalated into large-scale disputes that have resulted in burned villages, stolen cattle, destroyed farm produce, and violence.\n\n\u201cIllegal, unreported, unregulated fishing, oil bunkering, trafficking of weapons, narcotics, and people, as well as the on-going threat of Nigeria-based piracy and armed robbery at sea also pose a major threat to commerce, economic development and the environment for not just Nigeria, but the entire region.\u201d\n\nIbelli said countering these threats was a common goal for Nigeria and the United States. He stressed that the US mission in Nigeria would continue to work in concert with the Nigerian government, fellow diplomatic missions, and civil society to address the multi-faceted dimensions of conflicts and armed violence in the country.\n\nHe said the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \u201cbased in our Embassy in Abuja has the lead on coordinating the US government\u2019s humanitarian response, as well as helping to rebuild the basic civil institutions essential to re-establishing civil and social life in the hardest hit states and areas of northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs some of you may already know, the United States is the largest humanitarian donor in response to the North-east crisis, providing $1.45 billion since 2015 and supporting almost two million conflict-affected households.\n\n\u201cOur Public Affairs Section at the Embassy in Abuja also oversees our Countering Violent Extremism messaging efforts and provides support to train a cadre of indigenous messengers best poised to reveal the falsity and vileness of Boko Haram and ISIS propaganda. PAS Abuja also awards grants in support of Nigeria\u2019s response to the on-going instability in the North-west and North-central regions.\n\n\u201cSince 2017, Department of State and Department of Defense security assistance for Nigeria totals approximately $650 million. In addition to this assistance, the Super Tucano sale is valued at almost $500 million and remains the United States\u2019 largest Foreign Military Sale in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nOn the import of the summit, he said it provided a valuable forum for frank conversations on critical shared priorities, including security cooperation, humanitarian assistance, and stabilisation efforts.\n\nHe said \u201cwithout security, it is impossible to have the stability and environment that is conducive to robust economic development and capacity building.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the fundamental role of a free and independent media in a democracy, Ibelli said journalists helped ensure that citizens were informed and exposed to diverse perspectives on key issues, such as national security.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWell-informed citizens make countries stronger, and the exchange of ideas is the foundation for accountable governance and development in addition to the economy. To this end, the United States will never rest in supporting initiatives that promote press freedom, access to information and freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nIbelli described the United States as Nigeria\u2019s partner of choice against insecurity, adding that a military response alone cannot lead to sustained peace.\n\nHe stated,\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s success does not just depend on its military effectiveness on the battlefield \u2013 it requires improvements to the economy, fiscal transparency, violence free elections, anti-corruption, anti-nepotism efforts, a welcoming business environment for investors, and governance off the battlefield as well.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a comprehensive, all of government response is necessary to build a better future in all parts of this great country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Exercises successful, ruling party congratulates members\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Sunday said the crises in 20 state chapters of the All Progressives Congress (APC), where parallel congresses were held on Saturday to elect state officers of the party, were a clear reason why the nation was in conflict.\n\nBut the ruling APC has described the crisis-hit state congresses as successful and therefore congratulated its members for a good showing.\n\nPDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, explained that the fractious congresses of the APC had shown how greed and lust for power by the partyleaders created crisis in all facets of the nation\u2019s national life.\n\nThe party described the APC congresses as a harvest of confusion in which leaders of the party engaged in physical, verbal and emotional assault against another, while using their thugs to unleash mayhem on party members with charms and dangerous weapons.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed despicable that a party that has the incumbent President of the country could not successfully conduct state congress, as their leaders were seen behaving recklessly and investing heavily in violence; a development that speaks volumes on why our nation has been under the heavy yoke of violence, division, bloodletting and acts of terrorism under the APC watch.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of APC congresses in many of the states has shown that it is a party that lacks leadership direction and internal cohesion; a party of unruly people, who are averse to peace, which explains why our country is reeling in crisis under the APC,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nThe main opposition party said the APC could not guarantee or give unity, tranquility and progress to the nation. Instead, it said, \u201cAPC has continued to worsen the tension in the country. It has continued to show itself as a party that is troubled from within and only waiting to implode at any time.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be wary of the APC. If the APC congresses turned out this bad, one can only imagine the type of mayhem that would characterise its primaries as well as their involvement in the general election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also said the APC state congresses presented an unprecedented scenario in the history of Nigeria, where a party, which produced the incumbent President, would have its ranks so torn down in shameful spectacle\n\n\u201cNigerians should make a correct interpretation of the signal sent out by APC congresses, which is that the ruling party is a mere contraption and an inchoate body of desperate elements. Such a party cannot organise for the genuine development of the country.\n\n\u201cOur party, the PDP is not however unaware of the efforts by the APC to inject crisis into our congresses but we commend the deft handling of issues in all our congresses to avert a crisis situation plotted by the APC.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the APC cannot lead Nigeria to the promised land. It can only worsen the current uncertainty it has hitherto unleashed on Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe PDP remains the umbrella party that symbolises the yearning of Nigerians for unity, development, and security. The PDP is refocused to rebuild our national fabrics, reunite our people and chart a way forward for sustainable development in our country,\u201d it stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement, described the parallel Congresses held in some states as mere naming ceremonies.\n\nHe stated: \u201cIn adherence to internal democracy and the charge by the leader of our great party, President Muhammadu Buhari that the party be returned to the people, card-carrying party members came out enmasse to elect executives, who will take charge of APC affairs accross the states for the next four years.\n\n\u201cHowever, our attention has been drawn to reports of so-called and purported \u2018parallel\u2019Congresses. To borrow the phrase of one of our esteemed governors, such \u2018parallel\u2019Congresses are mere naming ceremonies.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe insisted that the purported \u201cparallel\u201d Congresses are futile activities and very strange to the party, it\u2019s Constitution and the guidelines for the conduct of the state and other congresses.\n\nThe party noted that only exercises conducted by duly inaugurated state congress committees were recognised by the party.\n\n\u201cThe APC leadership will not hesitate to take adequate and lawful measures against any person or interest sabotaging the collective party\u2019s interest and efforts to achieve peace and unity in our great party,\u201d Akpanudoedehe added.\n\nHe assured members that where contestations existed, adequate conflict resolution measures had been put in place to address them, saying the party has Appeal Committees for every Congress.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*PPPRA: Domestic supply increased by 11,000mt in September\n\n*Kyari pledges more transparency in NNPC\u2019s operations\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite soaring cooking gas prices, which the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recently attributed to short supply of the commodity, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), yesterday stated that the market has continued to grow beyond expectations.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja, yesterday, signed by the General Manager, Corporate Services, PPPRA, Kimchi Apollo, the organisation stated that Nigeria presently produces a major portion of the LPG consumed in the country locally, stressing that the so-called \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, remains on track.\n\nThe \u201cgrowth\u201d in the sector, the PPPRA stated, was because of the \u201cenabling environment created by the federal government through its programmes and policies to attract investment into the entire gas value chain.\u201d\n\nThe PPPRA stated that its assessment of LPG supplied in September 2021, indicated that out of the 76,578.986 metric tonnes of LPG supplied nationwide, 49,453.081mt was locally produced while 27,125.905mt was imported.\n\nIn the month of September 2021, it stated that the LPG data showed that 49,453.081MT was supplied into the domestic market by Algasco, Stockgap, NIPCO, 11 plc, Prudent, Greenville Natural Gas, PNG Gas, NPDC and Ashtavinayak Hydrocarbon Ltd with 66.58 per cent of the supply sourced from the NLNG, while 27,125.905 mt was imported by Rainoil, Algasco and Prudent.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy to note that the quantity of LPG sourced locally rose from 38,040.457mt in August to 49,453.081mt in September, while importation reduced from 47,224.346mt to 27,125.905mt.\n\n\u201cThe marked improvement in local production reflects the success of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva in providing the right enabling business climate for the gas industry to thrive,\u201d it stated.\n\nPPPRA stressed that policies and programmes such as the National Gas Policy (NGP), Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP), National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP) and the Decade of Gas declaration were responsible for the quantum of investments in the gas industry currently.\n\nIt listed some of the investments as the NPDC Oredo Integrated Gas Handling Facility, Kwale Hub Gas Processing Plants (PNG, Ashtavinayak Hydrocarbon) Greenville LNG, Rivers State and the OSO/Bonny River Terminal project.\n\n\u201cIn terms of policies, the waiver of import duties on LPG production equipment as well as the zero VAT for locally produced LPG have indeed heightened the prospects of domestic investment in the sector,\u201d the PPPRA said.\n\nIn addition, it stated that the Pioneer Status Incentive (PSI) for some categories of LPG investments was also introduced, stressing that it remains committed to the development of Nigeria\u2019s vast gas resources and strengthening the entire value chain.\n\nIn the last one year, the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), otherwise known as cooking gas, has been on the rise and has more than doubled in several parts of the country, a situation largely blamed on the scarcity of the product.\n\nOther factors that occasioned the rise included forex scarcity, naira devaluation and rising inflation, excessive arbitrary charges by government agencies as well as the newly-added 7.5 per cent Valued Added Tax (VAT).\n\nNigeria currently consumes about 1.2mmt of LPG, with the Nigeria LNG (NLNG) currently 450,000mt to the market, while marketers are left to import the remaining 750,000mt.\n\nA 6-kilogram LPG refilling unit now costs between N3,500 and N4000, while that of 12.5kg refilling unit costs between N7000 to N8000, depending on the part of the country the transaction is done.\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, has stated that the corporation remains committed to conducting its operations with transparency and accountability.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by the spokesman of the corporation, Mr. Garba Muhammad.\n\nSpeaking when he received, \u201cThe Sun Man of The Year Award,\u201d in Lagos at the weekend, Kyari attributed the successes recorded by the management team of the NNPC to the, \u201cfreehand and support\u201d accorded him by President Muhammadu Buhari, who he said has never interfered with the affairs of the NNPC.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done in recent years is to ensure that we take out all the opaqueness in NNPC. We also ensured that we represent Nigerians and work for them,\u201d the GMD added.\n\nSpeaking on the award, the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Newspapers, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh said Kyari was honoured for his \u201cdoggedness and resilience\u201d in the way he managed the operations of the NNPC during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, which saw the economies of many countries across the word struggling for survival.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) says it did not earmark N17.8 billion for miscellaneous expenses in the 2022 budget proposal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Punch had reported that FIRS earmarked about N550m for refreshments and N200m for sporting activities. It also reported that the agency budgeted N262.5 million for security votes and N17.8 billion for \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d expenses.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, Johannes Wojuola, special assistant on media and communication to the chairman of FIRS, claimed that the figures reported were grave misrepresentations of the budget proposal.\n\nWojuola said the agency earmarked N11.36 billion for key administrative expenses \u2014 and not N17.8 billion as reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement, however, did not give further details of other line items in the budget.\n\n\u201cAgain, the Management of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) wishes to draw the attention of the taxpaying public and the staff to yet another fatuous publication by the PUNCH Newspaper with the caption: \u201cFIRS to spend N2.8bn on uniforms, N550m on meals\u201d in its edition of 17th October 2021, and to urge all concerned to ignore the publication in its entirety, for it is utterly misleading,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cIt should be obvious to everyone that the reference the newspaper made to the budget for uniforms is not only false but also a misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the first place, it is not true that the Service had delivered the Budget Estimate to the two chambers of the National Assembly. Instead, the draft budget estimate was submitted only to the House Committee on Finance.\n\n\u201cAlso, its claim that \u201cthe total budget of the FIRS stands at N228 billion\u201d is blatantly not true. Again, what the newspaper referred to as Uniform is the Corporate Outfit (Dressing Allowance) enjoyed by all the staff. Similarly, the sum of N17.8 billion being bandied by the newspaper as an estimate for miscellaneous expenses is grossly false.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, the correct figure is N11.36 billion which represents the estimate for key administrative expenses for the whole year that the Service proposed to the National Assembly being an amount that would be incurred when approved, in respect of its over 500 operating offices and functions as well as for its 11,300 workforce.\n\n\u201cFor clarity, the estimated expenses are for medical expenses for over 11,300 staff, publicity, adverts & taxpayers education, welfare packages & festivity allowance to staff, corporate outfit grant (dressing allowance to staff), honorarium & sitting allowance for staff/stakeholders, sporting activities, and postages & courier services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe public is, therefore, to note that the amount budgeted for the above-listed items represents merely 5.26% of the total budget estimate for the year, 2022.\n\n\u201cWith these details of well-intentioned provisions in the budgetary estimates which were put together by the relevant departments in the Service, it is crystal clear that the Management is consciously committed to quality service delivery and staff welfare.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Management will continue to do everything within the limits of available resources to motivate and bouy up the morale of the staff.\u201d",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Contnet\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes. I am used to speaking to financiers and know the language and the key triggers to galvanise them into action. And they are used to me shouting loud and hard, over the years, about leveraging digital and technology to scale financial services for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDozie adds that he will be \u201cleaning on sector expertise and insight\u201d of the new investors to build long-lasting partnerships as Sparkle scales and predicted an improvement in the participation of HNWIs in Nigeria\u2019s tech and venture capital space in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think the trend will change as the market opportunities become more obvious to them, and better connections and networks are forged between tech entrepreneurs and HNWIs in Nigeria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see barriers to access broken down, which is important, but HNWIs also need to feel comfortable in investing in new sectors that they may not be so familiar with.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, neobanks are known to provide cheaper and more personalised banking through various models. Sparkle stands out in the sense that it is one of the few that offers a mix of individual and business banking services via a single platform.\n\nWhile individuals can use features such as savings, bill payments, money transfers, and other basic services, Sparkle Business, launched in April this year, offers MSMEs and SMEs functions that include inventory and invoice management, a payment gateway service, tax advisory, and employee management.\n\nThe startup has partnerships with Visa, Network International, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Nigeria that help power its offerings, and it has also secured a microfinance bank licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nPer TechCrunch, Sparkle has signed on over 40,000 individual banking customers and 2,000 businesses since its launch. It plans to continue focusing on connecting Nigerians and the global Nigerian diaspora, according to Dozie.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a massive youth population who increasingly live, work and play beyond physical borders\u2014we build with them in mind,\u201d Dozie said. \u201cWhether we are building services for individuals or businesses, we\u2019re fully focused on creating a connected tribe of Sparklers.\u201d\n\n***The article was updated with responses from Uzoma Dozie on the connection between his background and the Sparkle fundraise in the 9th and 10th paragraphs.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber",
          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "M-Pesa, Opay, Telebirr, Palmpay: How Chinese tech is powering African fintech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "DAO: A blockchain innovation that promises businesses and governments where everyone\u2019s the leader",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrencies popularised blockchain technology, but they are proving to be applicable in more ways than just fostering crypto transactions.\n\nOn June 12, 2021, we explored the possibility of conducting elections with blockchain technology to reduce costs and provide transparency, security, and fairness.\n\nBeyond the possibility of conducting better elections, another blockchain innovation claims to create a system of government or organisation without a central authority. Every citizen or member will make decisions that will be carried out by an automated program on a decentralised network.\n\nOn September 11, 2021, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG) unveiled bnugDAO, dubbed Africa\u2019s first Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, BNUG Founder and Coordinator, Chimezie Chuta, says DAOs could become the preferred system for running organisations and even countries.\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\nA DAO is a virtual decentralised organisation run by a community of people without hierarchy. It\u2019s an idea of an organisation that exists as a code on a blockchain network that was formulated and created by some members of the Ethereum community in 2016. They created a decentralised organisation, describable as a venture capital firm.\n\nThe platform was called \u201cThe DAO\u201d, and anyone could join and profit from it as long as they had the DAO tokens. They pooled funds together, decided which projects to fund and all actions were carried out by smart contracts, a computer program that ensures all rules are followed whether members wanted to or not.\n\nSmart contracts, like regular contracts, are agreements between people. The only difference is that a smart contract is automated to hold up both ends of the agreement without either party doing anything.\n\nThey work with commands such as, \u201cWhen Mr A receives payments from Mr B, send the goods over to Mr B.\u201d\n\nIt can also include a clause to send 10% of the payment to Mr C because he facilitated the transaction.\n\nSmart contracts execute actions on the DAO after predetermined conditions have been met. Imagine the DAO as a vending machine, representing an organisation in this analogy, selling drinks to people automatically.\n\nHowever, a vending machine still needs someone to take out the money, restock, and even perform routine maintenance. If the vending machine were a DAO, it wouldn\u2019t need anyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vending machine would run on smart contracts that would carry out operations, eliminating the need for trust among members of the organisation. The smart contract, for example, would send the amount of money needed to restock to the supplier once supplies are low.\n\nThe money made from the machine would be sent out to members of the organisations based on their investment at the agreed time.\n\nHowever, smart contracts don\u2019t make the decisions; people vote to decide what business changes to make. Anyone who has the governance token \u2014 which is the bnug token in the case of the bnugDAO \u2014 could propose a new idea. Members would vote on the idea they like, and the smart contract simply implements which idea has the highest number of votes.\n\nThis is perhaps why Chuta explains the DAO as \u201ca smart contract governed organisation, which is a model of organisation that the new web of trust demands.\u201d\n\nIn essence, a DAO is a system that tries to function by limiting human errors, which come from the difficulty in agreeing, taking decisions, and mistrust.\n\nWhy was the bnugDAO created?\n\nAccording to Chuta, BNUG members decided to create bnugDAO unanimously. He believes this new organisation model is more advanced and will provide a \u201csmart way of coming to a final decision on something.\u201d\n\nHe says the bnugDAO is also a model to show that blockchain technology can create powerful communities devoid of human errors.\n\n\u201cDAOs take care of all human elements that come into governance.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nbnugDAO was launched with decentralised applications (Dapps) such as a liquidity mining pool, which accepts liquidity in the form of the bnug token and rewards participants with the bnug governance token.\n\nThe liquidity pool is the same as a VC fund, where investors bring funds together and invest in startups. However, instead of managing partners deciding which startups will get investments, every member of the DAO has a say.\n\nDAO as a system of government\n\nRunning a nation\u2019s government as a DAO follows the same principle as the vending machine or venture capital analogy.\n\nMembers of the country are identified by their digital signature rather than names, ages, ethnic groups, or even race.\n\nEvery citizen can propose developmental projects, new policies, or systems.\n\nIronically, it could be proposed that the DAO system is scrapped, and if such a proposal receives a majority vote, the smart contract will oblige.\n\nAccording to Chuta, before a country can run as a DAO, an agreement to use the technology must first be reached.\n\nThen a smart contract, the backbone of any DAO, is created. Smart contracts have all the rules and will carry actions agreed upon by citizens.\n\nGovernance tokens will be required to make proposals, preventing multiple proposals from being made in a short time.\n\n\n\nGovernance tokens function just like any cryptocurrency, but they can be seen as a special coin used by members of an organisation to make requests or cast votes. So, the more proposals you want to make, the more special coins you need to buy.\n\nImmune to hacks?\n\nWhile blockchain technology appears unhackable, the programmes and applications created on it are only as secure as the creator is intelligent.\n\nLike regular contracts where lawyers find loopholes that favour their clients, smart contracts have holes that hackers can exploit.\n\nThe DAO, which launched in April 2016 on the Ethereum blockchain, suffered a hack that led to the end of the project.\n\nConsidered the greatest crowdfunding project of all time, the project gathered 12.7 million Eth (equivalent to $150 million at the time) at launch.\n\nUnfortunately, a bug was found in the smart contract, which gave way to an attack on The DAO.\n\nPer Cointelegraph, $60 million was stolen from the DAO wallet. But, technically, it wasn\u2019t stolen; the hacker exploited an existing loophole in the same way lawyers do. Legally speaking, the hacker did nothing wrong.\n\nBefore the attack, some researchers published an article that outlined flaws within the project that hackers could exploit.\n\nAlthough The DAO attack shows that the idea of a virtual organisation existing on the Internet and controlled by computer programs is flawed, Chuta believes the tech has evolved since 2016 and gotten better.\n\nThough the first DAO platform didn\u2019t survive, there are existing platforms such as MakerDAO, Aragon, MetaCartel, Gitcoin, and DASH. But according to Newsweek, there was a $7 million hack on MakerDAO in August this year.\n\nInterestingly, hacks aren\u2019t the only downsides to DAOs. The codes used in the creation are open source, meaning anyone can see it, figure out loopholes, and launch an attack.\n\nAn article on MIT Technology Review also stomps the idea, saying decision making isn\u2019t something done by just anyone. It argues that investing in startups, for example, is done by trained individuals and leaving individuals with no training to make decisions could have unfavourable consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nI\u2019m sure today\u2019s header might have warned you what to expect. Brace yourself for an exciting lineup of news stories in today\u2019s newsletter. So, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nWorld Food Day\n\nPaySika\u2019s $350 pre-seed\n\nA barrage of news\n\nNigeria\u2019s rising food inflation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome fish for your viewing pleasure\n\nEvery month, while drawing up the food budget, because I don\u2019t want to end up stranded in the market, I always add some more money to the previous month\u2019s prices.\n\nSometimes, it might hit the current cost; other times, it remained at the previous price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, a few times, the current prices exceed my budget, and I grudgingly part ways with more than I thought I would.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, on a year-on-year basis, food inflation in Nigeria increased by 19.57% in September 2021 compared to 20.03% in August 2021.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, however, food inflation increased by 0.20%.\n\nSo, what does that mean for the average Nigerian who spends almost 60% of their income on food?\n\nOur Reporters, Oluwanifemi and Chimgozirim, x-rayed this issue while attempting to give solutions and spotlighting three startups trying to solve this problem.\n\nYou can read it here: How agritech startups are helping to check food inflation in Nigeria\n\nPaySika\u2019s $350k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaySika\u2019s Founders\n\nOn Friday, October 15, 2021, Cameroon-based neobank, PaySika announced the raise of $350,000 in pre-seed funding from several angel investors in France, England, and Nigeria.\n\nThe startup aims to provide banking services to the unbanked in Francophone Africa and is leveraging existing mobile money infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaySika offers banking services not just on an app like most neobanks but on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram, using a chatbot.\n\nFor Roger Noel Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika, the challenge of financial inclusion is quite personal. In 2017, after gaining admission into a prestigious French university, he almost lost his place when he found out he could not pay cash.\n\nIt may sound bizarre, but Nengwe had gone to France with his entire school fees in cash. And coming from Cameroon, where only 34% of the population have bank accounts, most people carried cash.\n\nTo get a fuller picture, our Reporter, Emmanuel, had a chat with Nengwe on the raise, how he was finally able to pay his school fees, and a lot more.\n\nYou can find it here: With $350k pre-seed, PaySika is building a neobank for the unbanked in Francophone Africa\n\nIt\u2019s raining news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining news\n\nUsually, the weekend is a barren wasteland, but it appears a lot happened this time, and I\u2019m thrilled to be sharing them with you. But I\u2019ll make it quick \u2014 emphasis on quick.\n\n1. MTN has said the network downtime on Saturday, October 9, 2021, was due to an error that shifted all 4G customers onto the 3G band, which overloaded the entire network. As a result, users will be refunded data and airtime used between 12 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Saturday, 16th October 2021. The telco sent this via SMS to customers yesterday, including a link to an apology video from MTN Nigeria CEO, Olutokun Toriola. Interestingly, WhatsApp BCs claiming the link as fraudulent have circulated groups. The telecom operator, however, clarified on its Instagram page that the link is, in fact, real.\n\n2. Nigerian blockchain-powered, Wi-Fi sharing startup, Wicrypt has raised $1.5 million in funding in what appears to be a seed round to expand into new countries. Founded in 2018, the Enugu based startup was bootstrapped until 2020 by Ugochukwu Aronu. The round was led by AU21 Capital, with participation from Inclusion Capital, Pluto Digital Assets, Cardano, PolkaFoundry, Sandeep Nailwal, Founder of Polygon, and several others.\n\n3. In other startup news, Nigerian retail-tech startup, Alerzo has acquired Fintech company, Shago payments to expand its growth. This comes after a $10.5 million Series A in August 2021, led by London-based VC, Nosara Capital. The startup now offers several digital services to informal retail establishments, including mobile airtime top-up, bill payments, and peer-to-peer transfers.\n\n4. Flutterwave is in talks to increase its valuation to $3 billion, barely eight months after attaining unicorn status. The company has made several moves lately, partnering with Airtel, 9mobile, and MTN\u2019s mobile money platforms. It has also made some interesting appointments in the US and Nigeria. Were they in preparation for this?\n\n5. Last but not least, on Friday, October 15, 2021, protest-besieged Eswatini shut down citizens\u2019 Internet access for two hours. Demonstrations resumed after the fatal shooting of a protester in Malkerns, 20km west of the country\u2019s largest city Manzini on Wednesday. A blackout was first ordered in July and lasted for several weeks.\n\nProduct-led growth with Netcore and Techpoint Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a concluding note, last week, we brought you news of the Product-Led Growth (PLG) for B2C mobile apps, founders\u2019 meet and greet hosted by Netcore, in partnership with Techpoint Africa.\n\nThe programme held on Thursday, October 14, was a success, with discussions about the importance of a product-led strategy in abundance.\n\nIf you missed out, you can get this ebook on product-led strategy here and keep an eye out for other exclusive events we will be bringing your way in the coming months.\n\nCatch up on last week\u2019s stories\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nA bit long, but: It\u2019s Time to Stop Talking About \u201cGenerations\u201d.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa currently operates in a hybrid co-living and remote work environment. About half of the team live on the same premises, and once every month, we take a trip to the market to stock up on food items. Almost without fail, we discover that the prices of foodstuffs have increased since our last visit. Often, we complain, but because we have to eat, we pay for the products.\n\nRising food prices have become commonplace in Nigeria in recent years. However, not every Nigerian can be like those of us who grumble yet pay. For most people, even the slightest increase in food prices could be the difference between sending their kids to bed hungry and having just enough to eat.\n\nI tried painting a picture of what food inflation looks like, but this tweet about the increase in the price of sardines does a pretty good job.\n\nI just bought sardine at \u20a6675.\n\n\n\nIt was around \u20a6600 two weeks ago,\n\n\n\nand \u20a6300 early this year. Advertisement September 23, 2021\n\nWorld Food Day is observed annually on October 16 to draw attention to issues surrounding food supply, production, distribution, nutrition, and starvation, among other challenges. To commemorate this year\u2019s celebrations, we look at issues that affect food production and supply in Nigeria, highlighting the work of two agritech startups.\n\nIn addition, we spotlight the effects of food inflation and steps Nigeria can take to meet its food requirements but first, what is food inflation and what causes it?\n\nCauses of food inflation\n\nFood inflation refers to a situation where the prices of food items keep increasing. When this happens, consumers have to spend more to get the same goods they got at different prices in the past. Demand outstripping supply and supply being affected are the two major causes of food inflation. In Nigeria, the second reason is often the reason for the increase in food prices.\n\nWhile writing this article, I took a trip to the local market where I spoke to the traders to understand why food prices are constantly increasing. Surprisingly, most traders were clueless. Nonetheless, they did provide some insights.\n\nThe first trader, who identified herself as Mama Imole (Imole\u2019s mother), could not categorically state why the prices of food items were constantly increasing. She, however, offered an explanation \u2013 the agricultural inputs needed by farmers, such as pesticides and fertilisers, had become more expensive. It, therefore, makes sense that they increase the prices of their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of fish\n\nAnother factor that affects the price of food is infrastructure, of which transportation is a major component. There is no fixed cost for transporting goods in Nigeria as the state of the roads often varies in different parts of the country. An increase in fuel/diesel costs could also affect prices. To recoup their losses, farmers/traders often pass these added costs down to the final consumer.\n\nInsecurity is another factor that affects food prices in Nigeria. Since 2002, the Northern part of Nigeria has been plagued by activities of the dreaded Boko Haram. In recent years, the herdsmen crisis has taken centre stage, further complicating an already disturbing situation.\n\nConsequently, farmers in the North can\u2019t go to their farms. For a country that imports a significant part of the food it consumes, any disruption of local production adversely affects the price of food items.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEffects of food inflation\n\nEveryone feels the effects of food inflation but at different levels, from the mother who has to decide what to leave out while grocery shopping to the trader who has to sell almost twice as much to meet previous sales targets; there really is no winner.\n\nMama Imole believes that increasing food prices present a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. Traders can\u2019t sell as much as before because consumers\u2019 reduced purchasing power means they do not buy as much as they once did.\n\nMrs Adeniji, another trader, shares the same opinion. Since no farmer can produce all the food items their family needs, they buy what they need from others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more significant effect is one that Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of agritech startup, Releaf, points out. With Nigerians spending almost 60% of their income on food, he argues that it is more difficult for them to invest in themselves.\n\n\u201cThe impact on society is that people are unable to invest in themselves. So, on average, Nigerians spend 60% of their income on food, which only leaves the other 40% to invest in their education, health, passion, etc.\n\nSo if we want to create a world where Nigerians can reach their full potential, we have to create a world where Nigerians can decrease the portion of their income spent on essentials like food.\u201d\n\nTo put things in context, consumers in the US spent about 8.6% of their income on food in 2020, freeing up 91.4% for use in other aspects of their life.\n\nThe role of agritech startups in tackling food inflation\n\nLike other areas of the Nigerian economy, tech and tech-enabled startups have sprung up to solve the problem of food inflation. One such startup is Releaf. Currently playing in the palm kernel oil processing space, the startup purchases palm kernels from its network of over 3,000 smallholder farmers.\n\nThe startup developed Kraken \u2013 its proprietary technology \u2013 which it uses to crush palm kernels to produce palm kernel oil for its industrial clients.\n\nInfrastructural challenges dog the average entrepreneur, and logistics for agricultural products are a major challenge. Bad roads and insecurity add to the cost of transporting agricultural produce from the rural areas, where most of the production is done, to factories or markets.\n\nTo solve this problem, Releaf employs a decentralised approach when situating its factories. Rather than build factories in Nigeria\u2019s major cities, they site factories close to the farmers, thus reducing logistics costs and ensuring they pay farmers adequately for their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken. Image Source: Supplied\n\nFinancing is another issue that farmers face, one which Releaf tries to solve. In June 2021, the startup announced a partnership with OnePipe to offer digital financial services to the farmers in their network.\n\nAnother agritech startup doing great work in the space is Agricorp, a company that produces, processes, and exports spices. This month, it completed a $17.5 million Series A funding round with which it plans to expand its production capacity to 7,000 metric tonnes per annum.\n\nSince its November 2018 launch, the startup has reportedly supported over 5,000 smallholder farmers with inputs and training on agricultural best practices. Using its proprietary technology, Farmbase, the startup aggregates, registers, and pays farmers for products sold.\n\nCrop2Cash is another startup solving problems in the agricultural value chain. One way it does this is by providing financing for smallholder farmers, most of whom are financially excluded. The startup also provides them with agricultural inputs and options to receive payments digitally.\n\nA plan for food security\n\nAs the cost of food rises in Nigeria, it is clear that something must be done, and quickly too. Data from Statista shows that food insecurity increased steadily from 6.6% between 2014 and 2016 to 21.4% between 2018 and 2020. In plain terms, the number of Nigerians who go days without food has increased.\n\nWhile agritech startups are doing a great job, more needs to be done if Nigeria is to feed its growing population. The most obvious is a massive investment in infrastructure to aid the transportation of produce. Moody\u2019s estimates that Nigeria needs to spend $3 trillion over the next 30 years to fix her infrastructure deficit.\n\nGiven that figure is over 20 times Nigeria\u2019s annual budget, other means of funding infrastructure must be explored, including public-private partnerships.\n\nIn addition to fixing infrastructure, effectively fighting insecurity would ensure that more farmers can return to their farms.\n\nFood is a basic necessity, and a hungry nation can have devastating effects on the economy and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria risks spending 63% of oil revenues on petrol subsidy in 2022",
          "text": "Nigeria could spend about 63 percent of its oil income next year paying petrol subsidy if it doesn\u2019t end the practice before August 2022.\n\nThe government anticipates producing about 1.8 million barrels of oil daily and has projected to earn N3.16 trillion as revenue. It could however end up spending N2 trillion at the end of the 12-month deadline given by president Muhammadu Buhari to quit the practice as stipulated in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which became law in August.\n\nThis effectively means that the Federal Government has quietly deferred implementation of the PIA till August 2022, a development that delays reforms in the downstream sector.\n\nThe PIA provides for a full deregulation of the downstream sector with the regulator empowered to apply a backward integration policy that encourages local refining.\n\nUnder the Act, the license to import shortfalls may be assigned to companies with active local refining licences or proven track records of international crude oil and petroleum products trading.\n\n\u201cFull deregulation will lay down an open market for pricing of petroleum products and put an end to fuel subsidy,\u201d analysts at PwC said in their review of the PIA.\n\nBut capping the retail price of petrol will deter marketers from importing petrol. Oil marketers under the aegis of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) have called for the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry within six months.\n\nNigeria could pay a steep price for continuing to pay subsidy as analysts, including Goldman Sachs have raised their forecast for year-end Brent crude oil prices to $90 per barrel from $80 on the back of quicker demand recovery from the pandemic and Hurricane Ida\u2019s impact on US production.\n\nFailure to remove subsidy could see Nigeria pay over N2 trillon by August next year on petrol subsidies.\n\nRead Also: More pain for Nigeria as petrol subsidy consumes N608bn\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) which is due to get a makeover within the next six months and become a commercial entity, could still remain the sole importer of refined PMS into the country as a capped retail petrol price lower than landing cost will erode the profit margins of marketers who want to import petrol.\n\nEarlier this year, the NNPC said it has been spending about N120bn monthly on petrol subsidy. This is constraining its ability to fund the sharing of oil incomes among the various tiers of government. In the last four months, the corporation has not contributed money to the Federation Account and Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\nSources close to NNPC SAY of the 26 cargoes of crude the NNPC offers for trade, 11 are encumbered and 15 are used for NNPC under-recovery. Nigeria swaps crude for petrol under the Direct Sales Direct Purchase agreement where the NNPC offers refiners in Europe crude oil in exchange for refined petroleum products.\n\nThe danger for Nigeria\u2019s economy is that more of the crude cargoes are being diverted for the DSDP programme than are used to settle government obligations. This is why the government has been on a borrowing spree to augment fallen oil sales.\n\nTo worsen the situation, Nigeria\u2019s oil production has been declining so much that the country cannot even meet the quote set by OPEC. According to the newly released OPEC oil market report, Nigeria\u2019s oil production averaged 1.247 million barrels by day in September while its quota is set at 1.5millon barrels per day.\n\nFactoring in exchange rate, global oil prices and shipping cost, petrol prices are estimated at N212- N234/ltr compared to the retail price of N162-N165/ltr the government has mandated it be sold.\n\nAnalysts have long made an economic case against fuel subsidy including the fact that it is denying the country value that could have accrued from higher oil prices and translated into better infrastructure and economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe economic case for the removal of Nigeria\u2019s fuel subsidy regime is mounting by the day and the present administration seems undecided on how to proceed,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, former chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), told BusinessDay.\n\nHowever, the political case has been harder to make.\n\n\u201cThe government is in the process of fully deregulating the downstream petroleum sector which will end subsidies and free up funds for national development, including investment in renewables which will be part of the energy mix that ultimately powers our economy,\u201d said Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, at the recent Seplat Energy conference last Thursday.\n\nAt various times, Sylva and Mele Kyari, the NNPC GMD have called for the removal of subsidies providing sound reasons why it is an economic pain. In the end, the government backtracked due to political reasons, according to analysts.\n\nThe prospect for removal does not look promising a year to the general elections where the ruling party could face a bruising fight to hold on to power.\n\nData from presentations to Federation Account and Allocation Committee (FAAC) seen by BusinessDay indicated that subsidy cost rose from N143.29bn in June to N175.32bn in July but fell to N149.28bn in August.\n\nThis pattern of expenditure could worsen if analysts\u2019 projections on oil prices come true. Crude oil prices have risen nearly 45 percent from January $54.77 to over $80 and analysts at Goldman Sachs are forecasting $90 per barrel price in 2021 while JP Morgan analysts are even more bullish at $100 per barrel.",

As at this morning, all the 12 were here and they have been deployed to the North-east.\n\n\u201cWe can see that the Tucano jets are actually game changers.\n\n\u201cMost of the successes we have recorded in recent times is because of the acquisition of new platforms, not limited to the super Tucano,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said with the recent notable successes recorded by the military on insecurity, he was amused by a story on Monday that the Nigerian Air Force paid N20 million to bribe bandits so that they would not bring down the president\u2019s aircraft.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the Air Force immediately debunked this because this exposes their ignorance.\n\n\u201cBetween Zamfara, Katsina, parts of Kaduna and Niger states, there are about 150 bandit camps. Who then was the money given to?\n\n\u201cIt does not make any sense and it is because they do not understand how bandits operate that is why they can peddle that kind of fake news,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Mohammed said with the \u2018improved\u2019 security situation in the North-east and North-central zones the nation would experience improved food security.\n\n\u201cIf you observe what is happening recently, you can see heightened activities in the agricultural area.\n\n\u201cThis is because of the superior fire power of the military which is now making it possible for people to go to their farms, especially in the North east.\n\n\u201cThey have been able to put the criminals at bay,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister gave an assurance that the success of the military against terrorists and bandits would be sustained.\n\nHe therefore solicited the cooperation and support of Nigerians for the sustenance of the military action.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force on July 22 took delivery of the first batch of six of the A-29 Super Tucano aircraft from the United States.\n\nThe Director of Public Relations and Information, NAF Headquarters, Edward Gabkwet, who made the announcement, said the aircraft arrived in Kano.\n\nThe officials that received the aircraft included the Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi, Chief of Army Staff, Faruk Yahaya and Chief of Air Staff, Oladayo Amao.\n\n(NAN)",

According to him, developing tech skills can place students on a track to future careers in computer science, robotics and artificial intelligence, preparing them to solve real life problems with more creativity, critical thinking and effectiveness.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Mission in Nigeria is committed to supporting initiatives that promotes STEM education in Nigeria. Technological knowledge is an essential element of the 21st-century economy, and it starts in the classroom.

I am taking everything I have learned to my students and to encourage them to pursue careers in the STEM fields,\u201d she added.\n\nFollowing the completion of the training, the U.S. Consulate provided all 50 teachers a \u201cDrone in a Box\u201d to take back to their schools and classrooms. This is expected to provide the teachers and their students with an opportunity to put their newly acquired skills to use.\n\nThe Global Air Drone Challenge for Teachers is one of U.S. Mission\u2019s many initiatives that expand people-to-people ties and educational linkages between the United States and Nigeria, engage underserved communities, and strengthen human capital for inclusive Nigerian economic growth and human development.",

Bush\u2019s first secretary of state, he pushed faulty intelligence before the United Nations to advocate for the Iraq War, which he would later call a \u201cblot\u201d on his record.\n\nThough he never mounted a White House bid, when Powell was sworn in as Bush\u2019s secretary of state in 2001, he became the highest-ranking Black public official to date in the country, standing fourth in the presidential line of succession.\n\n\u201cI think it shows to the world what is possible in this country,\u201d Powell said of his history-making nomination during his Senate confirmation hearing. \u201cIt shows to the world that: Follow our model, and over a period of time from our beginning, if you believe in the values that espouse, you can see things as miraculous as me sitting before you to receive your approval.\u201d\n\nLater in his public life, he would grow disillusioned with the Republican Party\u2019s rightward lurch and would use his political capital to help elect Democrats to the White House, most notably Barack Obama, the first Black president whom Powell endorsed in the final weeks of the 2008 campaign.\n\nThe announcement was seen as a significant boost for Obama\u2019s candidacy due to Powell\u2019s widespread popular appeal and stature as one of the most prominent and successful Black Americans in public life.\n\nPowell is survived by his wife, Alma Vivian (Johnson) Powell, whom he married in 1962, as well as three children.\n\nProfessional Soldier\n\nColin Luther Powell was born April 5, 1937, in Harlem, New York, to Jamaican immigrants. After growing up in the South Bronx, Powell attended school at the City College of New York, where he participated in ROTC, leading the precision drill team and attaining the top rank offered by the corps, cadet colonel.\n\n\u201cI liked the structure and the discipline of the military,\u201d Powell said, according to a CNN profile of him in the early 2000s. \u201cI felt somewhat distinctive wearing a uniform. I hadn\u2019t been distinctive in much else.\u201d\n\nHe entered the US Army after graduating in 1958, and later served two tours in South Vietnam during the 1960s, where he was wounded twice, including during a helicopter crash in which he rescued two soldiers. He stayed in the Army after returning home, attending the National War College and rising in leadership. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1979, appointed as Reagan\u2019s final national security adviser in 1987 and was tapped by the elder Bush in 1989 to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nPowell\u2019s tenure in the elder Bush\u2019s administration was marked by his involvement in some of the most notable American military actions of the late 20th century, including the 1989 Panama operation, the 1991 Gulf War and the US humanitarian intervention in Somalia, though he retired from the Army days before the disastrous Battle of Mogadishu.\n\nAlthough Powell was initially reluctant to commit US troops when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, he became one of the administration\u2019s most trusted spokesmen when the assault on Saddam Hussein\u2019s army finally came.\n\n\u201cFirst we\u2019re going to cut it off. Then we\u2019re going to kill it,\u201d Powell famously said at a news conference at the time, referring to the Iraqi army.\n\nFollowing the assault, Powell became something of a national hero, enjoying a 71% favorability rating in the first few year years after the war. His efforts during the war also earned him two prominent awards: a Congressional Gold Medal in March 1991 \u201cin recognition of his exemplary performance in planning and coordinating\u201d the US response to Iraq\u2019s invasion, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nAs the elder Bush presented Powell with the award at a White House ceremony in 1991, he said the general\u2019s \u201cdeep compassion for every one of the thousands of men and women under (his) command will always be remembered.\u201d\n\nDuring Powell\u2019s time in the military, which lasted until 1993, he also received a number of other notable awards, including the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. He received his fourth star in 1989, becoming the second African American to rise to that rank.\n\nIn addition to the military awards, Powell also received the President\u2019s Citizens Medal, the Secretary of State Distinguished Service Medal, and the Secretary of Energy Distinguished Service Medal, as well as a second Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded with distinction, from President Bill Clinton.\n\nTop diplomat during turbulent time\n\nWith a prominent national profile, Powell was floated as a potential presidential candidate in the 1996 election. But in a highly anticipated decision, he declined to participate in the race, citing a lack of \u201cpassion\u201d for electoral politics.\n\n\u201cSuch a life requires a calling that I do not yet hear,\u201d he told reporters in 1995. \u201cAnd for me to pretend otherwise would not be honest to myself, it would not be honest to the American people.\u201d\n\nPowell was again encouraged to run in the 2000 presidential election, but rebuffed calls for him to mount a bid. He instead endorsed George W. Bush, delivering a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he argued that the then-governor of Texas would \u201chelp bridge our racial divides.\u201d\n\nHe was Bush\u2019s first Cabinet selection when he was announced as the 43rd President\u2019s nomination for secretary of state, and with his expertise in foreign policy and widespread popularity, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHe shared Bush\u2019s reluctance to project military strength across the globe, a view that was quickly displaced by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As Bush\u2019s top diplomat, he was tasked with building international support for the War on Terror, including the Afghanistan War, but it was his involvement in the administration\u2019s push for intervention in Iraq, over the concerns of many of America\u2019s longtime allies, for which his tenure at State would become best known.\n\nIn February 2003, Powell delivered a speech before the United Nations in which he presented evidence that the US intelligence community said proved Iraq had misled inspectors and hid weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\u201cThere can be no doubt,\u201d Powell warned, \u201cthat Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more.\u201d\n\nInspectors, however, later found no such weaponry in Iraq, and two years after Powell\u2019s UN speech, a government report said the intelligence community was \u201cdead wrong\u201d in its assessments of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction capabilities before the US invasion.\n\nBut the damage was already done \u2014 to both Iraq, which the US went to war with just six weeks after Powell\u2019s speech, and to the reputation of the once highly popular statesman, who was reportedly told by then-Vice President Dick Cheney before the UN speech: \u201cYou\u2019ve got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points.\u201d\n\nPowell, who left the State Department in early 2005 after submitting his resignation to Bush the previous year, later called his UN speech a \u201cblot\u201d that will forever be on his record.\n\n\u201cI regret it now because the information was wrong \u2014 of course I do,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Larry King in 2010. \u201cBut I will always be seen as the one who made the case before the international community.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swayed public opinion, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d he added, referring to how influential his speech was on public support for the invasion.\n\nIn his 2012 memoir, \u201cIt Worked for Me,\u201d Powell again acknowledged the speech, writing that his account of it in the book would likely be the last he publicly made.\n\n\u201cI am mad mostly at myself for not having smelled the problem. My instincts failed me,\u201d he wrote, referring to the report he used that contained faulty evidence of supposed Iraqi WMDs. \u201cIt was by no means my first, but it was one of my most momentous failures, the one with the widest-ranging impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe event will earn a prominent paragraph in my obituary,\u201d Powell wrote.\n\nShifting politics\n\nAfter leaving the Bush administration, Powell returned to private life. He joined the renowned venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins in 2005, where he worked as a strategic adviser until his death. For a time, he gave speeches at \u201cGet Motivated!\u201d business seminars, and he authored the 2012 memoir.\n\nThough the large majority of Powell\u2019s time as a public servant was spent in Republican administrations, the later years of his life saw him supporting Democratic presidential candidates and harshly criticizing top Republican leaders.\n\nBy 2008, the longtime Republican\u2019s coveted presidential endorsement went to another party when he announced his support for Obama\u2019s White House bid. At the time, he touted Obama\u2019s \u201cability to inspire\u201d and the \u201cinclusive nature of his campaign,\u201d while criticizing attacks on the Illinois senator by Republican presidential nominee John McCain\u2019s campaign as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d He was later named an honorary co-chair of Obama\u2019s inauguration and endorsed him again in 2012.\n\nPowell went on to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 over Donald Trump, whom he had strongly condemned as a \u201cnational disgrace and an international pariah.\u201d\n\nIn an extraordinary move that year, three presidential electors in Washington state cast votes for Powell rather than Clinton, resulting in state fines that were later upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nHe again snubbed Trump in 2020 during the President\u2019s second campaign, announcing his support for Joe Biden in June of that year while blasting Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cWe have a Constitution. And we have to follow that Constitution. And the President has drifted away from it,\u201d he told CNN, adding that he \u201ccertainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year.\u201d The retired general later delivered an address in support of Biden during the Democratic National Convention.\n\nAnd after Trump incited a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol in early January 2021, Powell told CNN that he no longer considered himself a Republican, with the longtime grandee of the GOP saying he was now simply watching events unfold in a country he long served.\n\n\u201cI can no longer call myself a fellow Republican. I\u2019m not a fellow of anything right now,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria on \u201cGPS.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just a citizen who has voted Republican, voted Democrat throughout my entire career. And right now, I\u2019m just watching my country and not concerned with parties.\u201d",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has said Nigerians will be able to use e-naira without Internet-enabled phones.\n\nThe apex bank which disclosed this in a document with the title \u2018Design paper for the eNaira,\u2019 said maximising the value and use cases of the eNaira would depend largely on devices with Internet capabilities.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira thus risks further alienating sections of the population who are uneducated, lack exposure and access to internet services or digital devices,\u201d it said.\n\nThe document noted that the National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-formal Education estimated that 35 per cent (37.1 million) of the nation\u2019s adult population was illiterate, adding that the CBN risked losing adoption to this segment of the population, PUNCH reported.\n\n\u201cTo mitigate this risk, the bank factored in the need for inclusiveness as part of the core design principle of the eNaira. This principle has enabled the bank to focus on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that Nigerians without Internet-enabled phones can access the service,\u201d the CBN added.\n\nThe apex bank said the eNaira would complement existing payment options available via the mobile banking apps, Point of Sale terminals, USSD, quick response code and Internet banking, among other channels.\n\nGSMA, a global industry organisation that represents the interests of mobile network operators, had said in a recent report that 19 per cent of people living in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries did not have access to mobile broadband coverage.\n\nAccording to the organisation, about 47 per cent (210 million people) in sub-Saharan Africa do not use mobile internet.\n\nIn its design paper, the apex bank said to ensure inclusive access while also ensuring the integrity of the financial system, the account-based Central Bank Digital Currency model has been chosen for the eNaira.\n\nThe CBN said, \u201cThe account-based CBDC model at its core mirrors the progress made on the National Financial Inclusion Strategy which enables access to financial services by leveraging last-mile networks to identify users and to provide banking services through channels such as PoS and USSD.\n\n\u201cWith the account-based model, the CBN seeks to enable access by leveraging the existing identity infrastructure in Nigeria such as the BVN, NIN, TIN, etc., to uniquely identify individuals and corporate entities.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, identity frameworks such as the NIN will enable access for the financially excluded as they can be uniquely identified, thereby enabling the provision of financial services. These identity systems will help ensure a robust KYC framework positioned to enable access for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe CBN added that interoperability between the eNaira and other CBDCs was factored into the design of the eNaira.\n\nIt said this would help improve cross-border payments and address issues of dollarisation of the economy.\n\nVisa, a payments company, recently said ease of operating CBDCs would determine the success of digital currencies.\n\nIt said, \u201cWe believe that for CBDCs to be successful, they must have two essential ingredients: a great consumer experience and widespread merchant acceptance. It means the ability to make and receive payments, regardless of currency, channel, or form factor.\u201d\n\nAccording to Visa, as the number of digital currency networks increases, the likelihood that consumers, businesses, and merchants are transacting on the same network and utilising the same type of money decreases.\n\n\u201cBut interoperability ensures that different networks can communicate and share data with each other,\u201d it said.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "Ban On Open Grazing Won\u2019t Solve Insecurity \u2013 NATBO",
          "text": "By Jonathan Nda-Isaiah\n\nThe No Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019 (NATBO 2019) has said open grazing, which is as old as Nigeria, has been generating a lot of hues and cries of late.\n\nUntil recently, they noted that herdsmen had been crisscrossing the country with their cattle unmolested and without molesting anyone.\n\nIn a statement by the National Co-ordinator of the group, Vincent G Uba,said there has hitherto not been news of herders carrying lethal weapons except for their clubs and sticks to control their flocks.\n\nAccording to him, this has been the practice for several decades running.\n\nHe said \u201cNot too long ago, we began to hear about herdsmen carrying sophisticated arms, getting involved in killings, kidnappings, and other criminal activities. We started to see gory photos and videos on social media and saddening news on the airwaves, of the gruesome murder of persons, allegedly carried out by Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThere is, however, no concrete evidence as to whether these crimes were committed by the Fulani herdsmen or not.\n\n\u201cGranted that there could be some bad eggs or criminals within the herders who perpetrate these crimes, it is pertinent to note that criminal tendencies equally obtain in other professions or occupations.\n\n\u201cIt would, therefore, be unfair to label the entire herdsmen as criminals. This is in no way an attempt to condone criminality.\n\nThe coordinator further stated that crimes should be condemned and perpetrators punished, no matter who is involved.\n\nHe said Nigerians should not subscribe to any undesirable elements invading and destroying crops in farmlands, much less any acts of rape against women and killing of farmers whose only \u201ccrime\u201d is trying to protect their farms.\n\nSome groups of persons, he noted that for cheap political gains, allege that open grazing is now a way of \u201cFulanisation\u201d of Nigeria and that these herders are agents of \u201cFulanisation\u201d of the country. Is this not phony?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, \u201cone wonders why the entire country had not been \u201cFulanised\u201d before now. For over ten decades, Nigeria had not been \u201cFulanised\u201d and no one had alleged that open grazing is a \u201cFulanisation\u201d strategy.\n\n\u201cIn another vein, some people paint the religious picture of herdsmen and open grazing, suggesting that nomadic herding is an exclusive preserve of Muslims and so mischievously declare that open grazing is an \u201cIslamisation\u201d ploy. How ludicrous! Again one wonders why the entire country had not been \u201cIslamised\u201d before now.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing that some people deceive themselves and so deceive unenlightened people into thinking that nomadic herding is only associated with Islam when we know that Christians, Muslims, Jews, etc are all descendants of nomadic herders? Yes all of us who claim we are descendants of or lineage of or identify with Abraham, David, Jacob, Amos, etc in the Bible are invariably descendants of nomadic herders.\n\n\u201cOther people paint an ethnic picture over open grazing and herding, thereby fanning the embers of ethnic war. These persons erroneously suggest that northerners (Hausa-Fulani) are the only herdsmen in the country, while the southerners (Yoruba, Igbos, etc) are not.\n\n\u201cThis is as deceptive as it is erroneous. The truth is that some northerners as well as some southerners engage in nomadic herding, with the northerners being in the majority.\n\n\u201cWhat is surprising and worrisome is that some Christian leaders mount the rostrum to make foul comments against herdsmen, preaching separatism and division, when they should be preaching tolerance, oneness and love amongst the different ethnic and religious groups.\n\nExplaining further he said \u201c It is quite unfortunate that these Christian leaders jettison the main Christian belief and teachings, which are hinged on the virtues of love, tolerance and oneness and do the opposite.\n\n\u201cHiding under the cover of \u201cIslamisation\u201d to condemn open grazing is not only most insincere, but also not Christlike. Why would some Christian leaders of thought be afraid of being \u201cIslamised\u201d by people who cross over to their territory when they should be happy and take advantage of the fact that these herders are in their territory and then aim conversely to \u201cChristianise\u201d them?\n\n\u201cTo the Southern Governors and others who have banned open grazing, we urge you to thread softly. Banning a system that is as old as Nigeria itself is bound to produce rebound effects.\n\n\u201cThis will definitely breed more crises and insecurity than is desired to be avoided. Legislating against open grazing without first providing alternative means of herding is likely to fuel more crises and heat up the polity.\n\n\u201cThe much talked about ranching is no doubt the way to go, with due consideration taken that the vast number of these people who engage in nomadic herding are illiterates. Educating them (nomadic herders) on the need for a new approach to their way of doing business is key.\n\n\u201cEducation, education, education is what will eventually solve the problem of open grazing. No educated person will be willing to engage in open grazing as a form of profitable business.\n\n\u201cAgain when the herders acquire some basic education, then they will be able to grapple with the knitty-gritty of ranching that requires the application of modern and scientific methods.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government once wanted to promote the RUGA system, which some insincere religious and ethnic separatist bigots viewed with suspicion and began to criticize and it was roundly rejected. RUGA, though imperfect, would have gone a long way to solve the problems of insecurity associated with herders/ farmers clashes.\n\nThe constitutionality of the actions of the Southern Governors in enacting laws banning open grazing remains to be determined by the courts of the land. Their action seems to contradict the constitution of the land, thus believed to be tantamount to preventing some people from lawfully engaging in any business of their choice in any part of the country.\n\nUba said Nigerians are Nigerians irrespective of tribe, religion and ethnicity and so should be allowed to do business anywhere they choose.\n\nAccording to him, if land can be mapped out to build Mechanic Villages for mechanics, or Computer Villages for computer businesses , or electronic markets for those who deal on electronics or timber/wood markets for wood workers , why not consider mapping out lands for herdsmen in the interim?\n\nThereafter, he said emphasis would be placed on reorientation of herders and education of the youths, especially of northern extraction in the long term.\n\n\u201cIf the required funding for ranches cannot easily be mobilized then a second look should be taken at RUGA system, which envisages that education facilities, hospitals, Mosques, Churches and other necessary infrastructures should be provided to enhance the education of the illiterate herders.\n\n\u201cSouthern Governors and leaders should show understanding and be patient with the herders and emulate the Kaduna State Governor who has already commenced building a ranch, which is to be followed by many more. He had sought to provide an alternative before banning open grazing.\n\n\u201cWe should take it easy. We, as Nigerians, will get there. That is, we will get to the time when we will be like Europe, United States of America and other developed countries that successfully practice ranching, if we embrace love, tolerance and oneness amongst ourselves,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Haitians on Monday mounted a nationwide strike to protest a growing wave of kidnappings, days after the abduction of a group of missionaries prompted FBI involvement.\n\nThe kidnappings have also fuelled international concerns over gang violence in the crisis-stricken Caribbean nation.\n\nOhio-based Christian Aid Ministries on Sunday said a group of its missionaries, 16 Americans and one Canadian, were in Haiti to visit an orphanage when they were abducted near the capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\nSecurity experts suspect the kidnapping was carried out by a gang known as 400 Mawozo.\n\nHaitian authorities have remained silent about the incident, and the whereabouts of the group of missionaries, which includes women and children, is unknown.\n\nA White House spokeswoman said Monday that the FBI was working with the U.S. diplomatic team in Haiti in efforts to locate and free those missing.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI confirmed its role.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is part of a coordinated U.S. government effort to get the Americans involved to safety,\u201d it said, declining to give further details.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday that the United States had dispatched a small team to Haiti to assist in efforts to locate and free the missionaries.\n\nThe missing missionaries have spotlighted a problem that has plagued Haiti \u2013 the hemisphere\u2019s poorest nation \u2013 for years.\n\nKidnappings have become more brash and commonplace in recent months amid growing political and economic crisis, with at least 628 incidents in the first nine months of 2021 alone, according to a report by the Haitian nonprofit Center for Analysis and Research in Human Rights, or CARDH.\n\nShops and schools in Port-au-Prince were shuttered on Monday as part of the strike first called by transportation industry leaders \u2013 whose workers are among the most common targets of gang abductions.\n\nBy early afternoon, billowing clouds of dark smoke towered above several sectors downtown as growing groups of protesters burned barricades on streets of the capital.\n\nPrivate-sector businesses said they were joining the strike to protest the constant kidnappings and what they said was a systematic incapacity by the government to address it.\n\nDiego Toussaint, a 37-year old Haitian entrepreneur who runs a business that sells solar panels in Port-au-Prince, said the country had finally hit bottom.\n\n\u201cThis strike is our way of saying that we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d Toussaint told Reuters. \u201cWe live in fear.\u201d\n\nToussaint said sales had plunged amid the threat of kidnapping and extortion that now haunt all workers and business owners.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t rely on the state, as job creators we are obliged to look after our own security,\u201d he said.\n\nDozens of protesters also voiced frustration about the rising costs of phone service in front of a major mobile service provider.\n\nSimmering anger and the country\u2019s already precarious security situation took a turn for the worse following the July assassination of President Jovenel Moise and an earthquake in August that killed more than 2,000 people.\n\nThe growing crisis in Haiti has also become a major issue for the United States.\n\nA wave of thousands of Haitian migrants arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border last month, but many were deported to their home country shortly after.",

          "text": "Gun-wielding bandits Sunday stormed a weekly market in Goroyo local government of Sokoto state, killing 30 people, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has confirmed.\n\nBut another report from Goroyo, though unconfirmed, said about 60 people were killed by the bandits during the attack.\n\nThe tragic incident occurred barely 12 days after the gunmen in yet another attack hit Unguwar Lalle market in Sabon Birni local government area of the state, killing scores.\n\nAs a major step towards curbing the incessant attack by bandits, Sokoto, like some states in the North-west of Zamfara, Kaduna and Katisna, took drastic measures, which among others, include cutting off mobile telecommunications networks, stopping sale of animals in markets and sale of fuel in jerry cans.\n\nThe quartets of Isa, Sabo Birni, Goronyo and Raba are local government areas of the state are at the frontline of banditry.\n\nGoronyo attack\n\nA human rights activist in the state, Basharu Guyawa, said the bandits raided the market with a force of about 200 men.\n\n\u201cWhat we learnt is that over 150 to 200 of them (bandits) on motorcycles rode through the Gundumi forest to Goronyo town. They went straight into the market and started shooting sporadically. They were not selective in their shooting; they obviously came to kill,\u201d Guyawa, the coordinator of Rundunar Adalci told Premium Times.\n\nHe, however, said nobody could ascertain the number of those killed in attack that locals said lasted for several hours.\n\n\u201cThe attack was horrendous,\u201d Guyawa said, in Hausa.\n\nBashir Adamu, a retired civil servant from Sabon Birni, said Sunday was a black day for the people of the area.\n\n\u201cIt was a black Sunday for us. Over 30 people were killed while more than 20 were seriously wounded,\u201d he said.\n\nIn yet another account, Blueprint gathered that the attackers came in hundreds with motorcycles, each carrying 3 bandits and stormed the market at about 5.00 pm shooting at the hapless traders\n\nThe police spokesperson in the state, Sanusi Abubakar, did not respond to calls and SMS sent to him on the attack by Premium Times.\n\nTambuwal confirms, wants more troops\n\nConfirming the development, Governor Tambuwal called on the federal government to deploy more troops in the state.\n\nThe governor made the call Monday while receiving in audience the chief of army staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya at Government House Sokoto.\n\nThe governor said the state was worst hit by banditry following military operations in neighbouring Zamfara state.\n\nTambuwal said more security presence and collective strategies were needed to contain the rising security challenges bedevilling the state and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cBetween last night, yesterday evening till this morning, we were greeted with a very dastardly attack in Goronyo local government, particularly Goronyo township, where scores and tens have lost their lives and still counting.\n\n\u201d We\u2019re not sure of the figure, but about 30 persons died,\u201d the governor told the COAS, also an indigene of the state.\n\nThe governor, however, called for synergy between the army and other security operatives in the state.\n\nTambuwal welcomed COAS Yahaya, describing the visit as a home coming, and his appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari as well cherished by people of the state.\n\n\u201dYou have come at a very trying moment for the army and the Nigerian nation. We are faced and bedevilled by many security challenges in our own area here, particularly banditry, kidnapping and other associated crimes.\n\n\u201d We shall continue to pray for your success, army and operatives in general to ensure success over criminals, \u201d Tambuwal said.\n\nHe pledged that his administration would continue to support the army and other security operatives toward overcoming the security challenges in the state.\n\nResponding, Gen. Yahaya said the visit was part of his leadership effort at meeting men and officers on ground in order to have direct interactions and obtain relative operational information.\n\nThe COAS said courtesy visit was to pay homage to the Chief Security Officer of the state and other notables to solidify army relationships with the authorities and communities.\n\nVisit to Sultan\n\nThe COAS had earlier paid courtesy call on Sultan of Sokoto Alhaji Mohammed Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, whom he described as a pillar in the country and booster to security operations.\n\nResponding, Sultan Saad assured the army boss of the traditional support and continued prayers for the army to overcome the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nKaduna\n\nBut in another southwest state of Kaduna, security agencies killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, outside Fatika in Giwa local government area of the state. During the exercise, one hostage was rescued as the fleeing bandits left behind motorcycles and other items.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan announced this in a statement Monday.\n\nHe said: \u201c10 armed bandits hibernating around some flash points in Kaduna state met their disastrous end. The joint security forces came in contact with the heavily armed bandits in Kwanan Bataru, on the outskirts of Fatika in Giwa local government area and subsequently engaged them. In the course of the gun duel, 10 of the bandits were eliminated while several others escaped with gunshot injuries.\n\n\u201cOne Alhaji Abubakar Usman, who is likely to have been kidnapped in a neighbouring state and was being held by bandits in the area, was rescued by the troops, and is being debriefed at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe bandits who managed to escape left behind several motorcycles, one revolver, mobile phones, torch lights and some charms. One of the sheds used by the bandits to hold hostages was burnt.\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Kaduna state, Malam Nasir el-Rufai commended the security forces for taking out the notorious bandits. The Governor wishes the troops and personnel more success in the ongoing operations across the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government is appealing to residents of Fatika general area to report to security agencies anyone found seeking medical attention for questionable injuries on these numbers: 09034000060 and 08170189999. All information received will be treated with the utmost confidentiality,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nPolice Div ablaze in Ebonyi\n\nIn a related development, unidentified gunmen Sunday invaded Ohaukwu Police Division at 135, Ezzamgbo, Ohaukwu local government area of Ebonyi state and set the station ablaze.\n\nThe gunmen were also said to have killed a police Sergeant and burnt vehicles at the station during the incident which occurred at about 12 midnight.\n\nConfirming the incident, Police spokesperson, DSP Loveth Odah, said policemen on duty repelled the attack but regretted that a sergeant of the Nigerian Police was lost to the incident.\n\nShe said: \u201cAbout 23hrs, a (sic) yet to be identified gunmen came to Ohaukwu Divisional Headquarters to attack the men and officers on duty and they were repelled. On the process, one police officer, a Sergeant paid the supreme price.\n\n\u201cThey threw petrol bomb into the station and unfortunately, it got one of the patrol vehicles and exhibit vehicle parked at the place.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police has visited the station for on the spot assessment of the area. He has met with the community leaders. This is the first time we are experiencing such a thing and the non state actors being the vigilantes and all those security outfits are of great assistance to the police. It is very surprise thing to us, we don\u2019t expect any attack.\u201d\n\nLai on bandits, insurgents, IPOB\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed has described bandits as criminals who don\u2019t have an ideology compared to groups such as the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nLai said this Monday during an interview with TVC, \u2018This Morning.\u2019\n\nThe minister explained that the bandits are not known for either a religious or ideological motive.\n\nAccording to him, armed bandits wreaking havoc across the North-Western part of the country are just simple criminals who believe in Nigeria\u2019s unity and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cThe difference between IPOB, Boko Haram on one side and bandits is that, while IPOB and Boko Haram are driven by ideology, a belief that they don\u2019t want to be part of Nigeria, bandits have no flags.\n\n\u201cBandits have no flag. Bandits are simple criminals. There\u2019s no difference between bandits and other criminals other than their ferocity. Bandits have never said they don\u2019t believe in Nigeria, they are just pure criminals.\u201d",

          "text": "The sit-at-home ordered by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) across the five states of the South-east is fast impacting negatively on the populace, as business owners and residents alike have cried out in anguish to say they have had enough.\n\nFrom Abia to Enugu, Ebonyi, Imo and Anambra states, the trend remains the same as businesses have remained under lock and key while owners continue to comply with the IPOB order for fear of being attacked by the secessionists.\n\nThe order, which is to protest the continued detention of IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, commenced some two months ago.\n\nThough to be observed whenever the IPOB leader surfaces in court, it has however become a permanent feature as people are afraid to come out to avoid possible attack.\n\nMoreover, the group also declared the observance of the order every Monday.\n\nThe order intensifies as Kanu appears in court Wednesday to continue with his trial over alleged \u201cterrorism, treason, running an illegal company, publishing defamatory material and illegal possession of firearms.\u201d\n\nAbia\n\nIn Abia state, where there was partial compliance last week, for instance business owners who dared the order forcefully shut down when news filtered that hoodlums were attacking Ohiya Mechanic village, Umuahia over non-compliance.\n\nWhile there were skeletal services at the state secretariat, only one lawmaker was sighted by one of our reporters during a visit to the 24-member state legislature.\n\nAlthough no serious incidents or loss of lives as witnessed in other states within the region, the sit-at-home order has impacted negatively on the economic life of both the people and government.\n\nIn specific terms, those who earn their livelihood from daily earnings are not finding things easy.\n\nAccording to the residents, the situation has become so appalling that they, in unison, called for an end to the order for normalcy to resume.\n\nSpeaking on the development, President Umuahia Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (UCCIMA) Chief Nkem Chidi Aruoma said the \u2018Monday order\u2019 is badly hitting the economy of the state as well as those of ther states in the region.\n\nThe UCCIMA boss, who noted with dismay the economic loss worth millions of Naira, further said business owners do not open shops for business transactions on sit at home days.\n\nHe also said businessmen from neighbouring Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers states would prefer to visit other states free of restriction orders than coming to Abia state.\n\n\u201cWhen businesses are not open, it affects both individual businessmen and government\u2019s revenue base ,including the poor masses who hawk pure water for their living.\n\n\u201cEvery day there is sit- at-home, we lose hundreds of millions of naira. Transporters are not bringing out their vehicles on the road, shop owners are not opening for business, we are begging the agitators to have a change of mind before the South East is completely killed,\u201d Aruoma said.\n\nAlso, General Manager Abia State Passengers Integrated Manifest Safety Schemes (ASPMISS) Chief Ezinwa Abiri (JP) noted that Monday sit- at-home order was hitting the agency\u2019s revenue base \u2018below the belt.\u2019\n\nPrior to the order, he said ASPMISS as a self-sustaining agency used to pay salaries before the end of the month because they were generating revenue, saying \u201cthe agency has lost between N6 million to N8 million within these two months the sit-at- home order lasted.\u201d\n\nA female operator of Lotto games from Aba road Umuahia who craved anonymity, said the order has affected the volume of patronage.\n\nWhen Blueprint sought the reaction of a traditional ruler in the state, he turned down our request.\n\nAnd amidst all this, the state government has assured citizens to go about their lawful businesses, saying there is no cause for alarm.\n\nAnambra\n\nIn Awka, Anambra state, Blueprint reports that residents are passing through pains and agonies, while students missed their examinations and events rescheduled all in observance of the order.\n\nAlso, with less than a month to the state\u2019s governorship election, some political parties cancelled or postponed open campaigns, with some others taking theirs to Anambra residents at Lagos, Abuja, Rivers, Delta and so on., even as many others launched and maintained only online campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything for now. I will open my shops only when I see that people have done that too. I don\u2019t want to die or lose my wares. Would govt feed my family? They are telling us to open shops but it won\u2019t be possible unless we, the traders and markets agree to do if there is improved security. Truly, it is affecting us. We now have only five days to trade in the week,\u201d a trader, Mr Sunday Egwuatu noted.\n\nAn economist and former governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Charles Soludo, at a recent stakeholders\u2019 meeting posited that Anambra state alone lost a sum of N19.6billion at every sit-at-home.\n\nAlthough IPOB later announced cancellation of the order as well as its enforcement, people are still observing it out of fear of the unknown.\n\nUnknown gunmen and rival cult groups seemed to have latched on the \u2018loophole.\u2019\n\nCasualty figures\n\nFrom September 28 to October 11, 2021, not less than twenty persons have been gunned down by hoodlums in the state. Among them are Dr Chike Akunyili, husband of the late Minister of Information, Prof. Dora Akunyili; and Dr Lawrence Ezenwa. Vehicles, houses and other valuables were also set ablaze across the state.\n\nAt a recent interview with State House Press Corps, Governor Willie Obiano exonerated IPOB from the killings.\n\nOn why he was not at meeting of the south-east governors, the governor had said: \u201cHow did you expect me to sit down at table and discuss security with those who are sponsoring the insecurity and killings in my state? All I know is that we are going to find out the hoodlums and bring them to book!\u201d he stated.\n\nIn a broadcast to people of the state September ending, the governor said:\u201dNdi Anambra, these attacks and accompanying deaths cannot be justified and must stop now. I have therefore conducted an extensive security meeting and have directed all Security Agencies to step up and confront this monster ravaging our land. I charge everyone involved in the security architecture of Anambra State to take very seriously, this threat to our livelihood and boldly rise to confront same.\n\n\u201cTraditional Rulers, Presidents General, Clergy men, Vigilante Groups and all leadership structures must now take responsibility and in conjunction with the Police, Military and other Law Enforcement Agencies, work to restore order immediately.\u201d\n\nWe \u2018re vindicated \u2013 IPOB\n\nMr Emma Powerful, the IPOB media and publicity secretary said: \u201cWe are the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), under the able leadership of our Leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. We have always distanced ourselves from the senseless killings in Biafra land especially in Anambra and Imo States but some gullible fellows do not want to believe us. Now we have been vindicated by the recent confession by Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State on why he did not attend the meeting of South East governors in Enugu.\n\n\u201cFor the umpteenth time, let\u2019s restate that we have no hands in the senseless killings of innocent citizens in Biafra land especially Imo and Anambra States.\u201d\n\nFrom January till date, Anambra has hosted four commissioners of police. They are John Abang who was moved following his promotion to the rank of Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG).\n\nThe rest are Monday Bala Kuryas, February 18 to April 29; Chris Owolabi, April 30 to September 9; Tony Olofu, September 10 to October 7; and the current CP, Echeng Owolo, who assumed duty October 8.\n\nEbonyi\n\nIn a related development, there are also cries from business owners and individuals in Awka, Ebonyi state.\n\nIn an interview with Blueprint, the state Commissioner for Commerce and Industry and Businesses Development, Dr Stephen Odo said businesses and economy of Southeast had been affected.\n\nOdo sued for peace and pleaded with the IPOB to adopt a more acceptable approach in driving their demand home.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor business to grow, we really need peace not just peace but peaceful environment and serene environment, environment that has ability to stir confidence in the mind of people . Businesses entails people moving from one point to another point, and if at any point there is insecurity, nobody will want to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd here we are in southeast we are suffering a self-inflicted problem because in self-inflicted problems, nobody achieves result by punching itself. For me southeast is just inflicting itself.\n\n\u201cWe are a region that is known by trade, by commerce and it involves day- to- day business transaction and activities. So, anything that hinders business activities is actually destroying the economy of the southeast and this is our pride,\u201d he said.\n\nBusinesses relocating from southeast\n\nThe commissioner also hinted that businesses were relocating from the southeast region.\n\n\u201cI may not have the data but it is obvious that when there are security challenges, people begin to take different decisions, so nobody can say it\u2019s not possible that a lot of persons, for a strange happening, must have left the region. It is possible because people look for environment where their businesses are secured, we are no longer assuring our investors that kind of security that we need to have.\n\n\u201cSoutheast used to be exceptional in terms of investment designations, southeast is notable for a peaceful coexistence, this is completely strange to our culture, this is completely strange to our environment, this is completely strange to the known ideology of the southeast, so it is possible that a lot of businesses are leaving. Imagine some banks closing up for a whole day or three times in a week, so it is possible that a lot of businesses may have considered looking for another safer region even closing some branches, and I think the earlier we address that the better for us,\u201d the commissioner further said.\n\nEnugu\n\nIt\u2019s same story in Enugu state where one of our correspondents quoted the apex Igbo cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, as pleading than an end be to the sit-at-home order.\n\nOhanaeze National Publicity Secretary Chief Alex Ogbonnia said if IPOB failed to stop the order, they might lose the respect and solidarity of the Igbo people, pointing out that their leader, Kanu loves the people and would not want the Igbo land to suffer unduly.\n\n\u201cI do not think the IPOB which Nnamdi Kanu represents would like to inflict hardship and injuries on Ndigbo. They would be playing into the hands of hoodlums even when IPOB has suspended the weekly sit-at-home, some hoodlums hijacked it and went on killing, maiming and destroying Igbo property.\n\n\u201cThey, IPOB, will lose the solidarity and sympathy of the people. In the process, the essence would become questionable and will become counterproductive,\u201d Ogbonnia said.\n\nAlso making similar plea, Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Chief Edward Ubosi, urged IPOB to let go of the order to save Igbo people from hunger and starvation, noting that many depended on daily sales and services to survive.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to note that the sit-at-home exercise being embarked upon in the Southeast zone is a great disservice to our people. This is because our people who mainly depend on buying and selling can no longer move about to fend for themselves. This is a time bomb,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nHowever, many continued to comply with the order for fear of being killed or injured.\n\n\u201cMe, go to market? I\u2019ll not go to market until this thing is over. I know that I am losing money any time I did not go but I\u2019ll not go out and risk my life,\u201d James Okoh a trader who deals in foodstuff at Garriki Market, Awkunanaw, Enugu said.\n\nOn the effect of the order, a former minister of power, Prof. Chinedu Nebo said: \u201cI foresee blood bath. Criminals have been posting names on the social media who are abroad causing trouble in Igbo land. I foresee a gang war and a bloodshed in Igbo land.\u201d\n\n\u201cSit at home today, sit at home tomorrow, what for? Who are those suffering these things? Is it not my people, our people? When I talk, they say I should concentrate on preaching the gospel,\u201d said the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nsukka Diocese, Bishop Godfrey Igwebuike Onah.\n\nImo\n\nLike all other states in the region, the weekly protest has continued to render all commercial banks, shopping malls, markets and business centres in Imo state inactive.\n\nA staff one of the banks along Bank Road in Owerri, the state capital, who pleaded anonymity said the protest \u201chas really affected bank businesses in particular and the country\u2019s economy in general as the usual turnover is not recorded.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince it started, the normal business atmosphere has disappeared as they open towards afternoon sometimes and don\u2019t open at all some other times for fear of their facilities being destroyed.\n\n\u201cLack of security from the state government has made it difficult to open. We feel that the government cannot provide enough security with which to fight for us when they come to enforce the order, so as a result, we prefer to lock up everywhere till the next day. And this makes our customers patronize Point On Sale( POS) operators scattered all over the place. This situation also makes us to have an uncontrollable mammoth crowd every Tuesday which slows down business, even at our Automated Teller Machines(ATMs).\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, traders in the markets and other business centres also suffered similar economic losses resulting from lockdown.\n\nFor Madam Oluchi who deals in rice and beans in cups and paint containers at the World Bank Market Owerri, replenishing their stocks has become difficult.\n\nAlso, for Uche, a Toyota spare parts dealer at Alaba Market at Naze, most of his customers come Mondays.\n\n\u201cThis means the sit-at-home has taken my customers and the money which would have gone into my pocket on that day. I suggest, we re-strategise for a better protest which will not affect our businesses as Ndi Igbo. You know we have families that we cater for,\u201d he said.\n\nSame pains are also shared by operators of commercial vehicles, commuters as well as residents, just as education which is the greatest industry in the state continues to suffer.\n\nFor instance, a parent, James Ajomiwe had complained about how his wards missed their English papers during one of the national examinations.\n\nWay forward\n\nOn the way out, Hon. Vincent Anthony Ubani, Director General, Nigerian Corporate Social Responsibility Fund, said all states in the region should allow the youth and people\u2019s choice to prevail against the wishes of the few.\n\nUbani also appealed to the federal government to fast track release of the detained IPOB leader and other Nigerians \u201cillegally\u201d held hostage by the security apparatus.\n\nCondemnation trails order\n\nAlso condemning the ugly scenario, the South East Igbo Youth Stakeholders said the order was negatively affecting lives, property and socio economic wellbeing of the people.\n\nThe youth, through their spokesman, Mazi Chukwuma Okpalezeukwu, observed that the challenges facing the region cannot be divorced from angers of the youth against the system and leadership, and appealed for a larger stakeholders meeting where all would brainstorm on ways forward.\n\nSimilarly, leaders of Ohanaeze Nd\u2019Igbo worldwide and the Anambra State Association of Town Unions (ASATU), at a recent joint press conference, urged the federal government to listen to the voices of people as \u201cit has become difficult for the elders to control the youths due to the perceived inequality meted out on the South East people.\u201d\n\nNational Vice President of Ohanaeze Nd\u2019Igbo Worldwide, Chief Damian Okeke-Ogene and his ASATU counterpart, Chief Titus Akpudo, also sought release of Kanu and need for all regions in the country to be respected and treated equally.\n\nThe religious institutions have also resorted to prayers at their various churches for an end to the mayhem and peaceful Anambra state November 6 governorship election.",

          "text": "The launch of FirstMobile App by First Bank of Nigeria Limited provides an opportunity for its customers to conveniently access both financial and non financial transactions. AMAKA IFEAKANDU writes on the recognition this initiative and many others have attracted to the FBN globally.\n\nOver the years, the development in digital financial technologies across the world, like e-money, digital banking and crowd funding platform has tremendously changed accessibility of financial services.\n\nWith the advent of technology in the nation\u2019s financial landscape, financial institutions have become more innovative in their service delivery to their customers.\n\nInnovation in banking industry\n\nThe new innovation has, to some extent, placed the entire banking industry on the fast lane to brainstorm daily and think towards installation of efficient electronic devices that will meet the demand and expectations of customers in terms of service delivery.\n\nThe transformation in the industry which comes with speed and convenience, has become the order of the day as all Nigerian banks have keyed into different electronic banking applications to make transaction faster, easier and more customer friendly.\n\nFirst Bank digitalisation process\n\nAnd First Bank of Nigeria Limited, Nigeria\u2019s most valuable banking brand, is not left out in this digitalisation process.

But\n\nthe FirstBank customers has nothing to worry about as FirstMobile App comes with a user-defined transaction pin which is an extra security feature.\n\nCustomers can also perform the following actions on the enhanced app: Change Transaction PIN, Reset Transaction PIN, Synchronize token, and change their log in pin \u2013 mPIN.\n\nAlso, FirstMobile is embedded with a card protection service for customers to enable and disable cards on channels, account switch off as well as second-factor authentication and device registration. Customers can remotely initiate the request for a new debit card as well as the replacement of a lost or damaged one, while managing activities on their card and account.\n\nFirstMobile takes into cognizance the security of customers and their funds.\n\nThe biometric for transactions is an innovative security upgrade on the application\n\nto validate transactions.

Customers are to go to the Card Management Service, under the \u2018self- service\u2019 menu on FirstMobile to disable or enable any of the features.\n\nThe Quick Response (QR) payment solution on FirstMobile App allows customers to pay for goods and services by using their phone cameras to scan QR codes at merchant locations or uploading a QR code on a smart phone via the FirstMobile App. Payment goes straight from the customer\u2019s FirstBank account into the merchant\u2019s account and provides real-time notification to both parties.\n\nThe transaction receipt feature enables customers generate receipt after a transaction on the FirstMobile App. This feature overrides any concerns around the confirmation of transactions as receipts can either be saved to the mobile phone gallery for future reference or shared directly with recipients of each transaction via email, WhatsApp,\n\nAnother thing rooted into the FirstMobile App is the \u2018Save Beneficiary\u2019 feature, where customers can save beneficiary details for later transactions.

          "text": "The United States Government has described the humanitarian crisis in Nigeria\u2019s North-east as one of the world\u2019s most challenging and complex. U.S Consulate Public Affairs Officer, Stephen Ibelli, disclosed this at the Nigeria Info 99.3 FM \u201cSecurity and Development Summit\u201d, during a session on \u201cUS and Nigeria Security Assistance and Cooperation\u201d.\n\nThe summit was in commemoration of the radio station\u2019s 10th anniversary.\n\nIbelli pledged the U.S. government\u2019s continuous support to Nigeria in the fight against insecurity. He said estimates by the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think-tank, showed that more than 350,000 people had been killed in the North-east since 2009, while about three million people had been displaced across the Lake Chad Basin region.\n\nIbelli further said the trail of death, destruction, and personal losses inflicted by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa was immeasurable. He said the North-west also faced the threat of banditry, a type of organised crime that included kidnapping, armed robbery, murder, rape, cattle-rustling, and the exploitation of environmental resources.\n\nAccording to the envoy,\n\n\u201cThese armed groups have terrorised communities, killed and displaced thousands, hindered socio-economic development, and threatened democratic governance.\n\n\u201cThere is also the farmer-herder conflict worsened by climate change, rising populations, and competition for dwindling resources.\n\n\u201cDisagreements between pastoralist and farmers that may have once seemed manageable and isolated have escalated into large-scale disputes that have resulted in burned villages, stolen cattle, destroyed farm produce, and violence.\n\n\u201cIllegal, unreported, unregulated fishing, oil bunkering, trafficking of weapons, narcotics, and people, as well as the on-going threat of Nigeria-based piracy and armed robbery at sea also pose a major threat to commerce, economic development and the environment for not just Nigeria, but the entire region.\u201d\n\nIbelli said countering these threats was a common goal for Nigeria and the United States. He stressed that the US mission in Nigeria would continue to work in concert with the Nigerian government, fellow diplomatic missions, and civil society to address the multi-faceted dimensions of conflicts and armed violence in the country.\n\nHe said the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \u201cbased in our Embassy in Abuja has the lead on coordinating the US government\u2019s humanitarian response, as well as helping to rebuild the basic civil institutions essential to re-establishing civil and social life in the hardest hit states and areas of northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs some of you may already know, the United States is the largest humanitarian donor in response to the North-east crisis, providing $1.45 billion since 2015 and supporting almost two million conflict-affected households.\n\n\u201cOur Public Affairs Section at the Embassy in Abuja also oversees our Countering Violent Extremism messaging efforts and provides support to train a cadre of indigenous messengers best poised to reveal the falsity and vileness of Boko Haram and ISIS propaganda. PAS Abuja also awards grants in support of Nigeria\u2019s response to the on-going instability in the North-west and North-central regions.\n\n\u201cSince 2017, Department of State and Department of Defense security assistance for Nigeria totals approximately $650 million. In addition to this assistance, the Super Tucano sale is valued at almost $500 million and remains the United States\u2019 largest Foreign Military Sale in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nOn the import of the summit, he said it provided a valuable forum for frank conversations on critical shared priorities, including security cooperation, humanitarian assistance, and stabilisation efforts.\n\nHe said \u201cwithout security, it is impossible to have the stability and environment that is conducive to robust economic development and capacity building.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the fundamental role of a free and independent media in a democracy, Ibelli said journalists helped ensure that citizens were informed and exposed to diverse perspectives on key issues, such as national security.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWell-informed citizens make countries stronger, and the exchange of ideas is the foundation for accountable governance and development in addition to the economy. To this end, the United States will never rest in supporting initiatives that promote press freedom, access to information and freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nIbelli described the United States as Nigeria\u2019s partner of choice against insecurity, adding that a military response alone cannot lead to sustained peace.\n\nHe stated,\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s success does not just depend on its military effectiveness on the battlefield \u2013 it requires improvements to the economy, fiscal transparency, violence free elections, anti-corruption, anti-nepotism efforts, a welcoming business environment for investors, and governance off the battlefield as well.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a comprehensive, all of government response is necessary to build a better future in all parts of this great country.\u201d\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi",

Under rules he announced last month, it will ultimately answer to him rather than to Bouden.\n\nSaied has promised to uphold rights and freedoms but has given no indication of when he will relinquish his new powers.\n\nNone of the other three lawmakers currently detained in prison have been formally charged with an offence. Two have been accused of insulting police. Their lawyer described their detentions as political.\n\nThe third legislator is accused of corruption in connection with a phosphate contract.",
