Atiku returned to the country after months of his stay abroad.\n\nMany social media users were surprised at the meeting of the two chieftains who belonged to different political parties in the country.\n\nCommenting on the meeting via his Twitter handle on Saturday, Rahman wrote, \u201cOn the Asiwaju Bola Tinubu \u2013 Alhaji Atiku Abubakar video at Abuja Airport. It was a chance meeting at the airport in Abuja. Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar had arrived first and was in his car about to leave when Asiwaju arrived.\n\n\u201cAs he was informed about him, Asiwaju walked up to Atiku vehicle to exchange pleasantries with him.\n\n\u201cThose making an issue out of this noble gesture should have a rethink. For the life of me, are they saying if two persons know each other and are friends, they must not greet each other as mature persons again because they find themselves in opposing political parties? If that\u2019s their thinking, this is a warped idea!\u201d",

          "title": "MAY 29 SPECIAL: Nothing has changed under Buhari \u2013Gen. Ishola-Williams",
          "text": "Renowned anti-corruption crusader, Maj. Gen Ola Ishola-Williams (retd) has declared that imposing a state of emergency on the nation will not solve insecurity and other challenges currently facing the nation. Making the assertion in an interview with TUNDE THOMAS, the retired General regretted that nothing has changed in the polity under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. Noting that those in charge of the nation\u2019s security are incompetent, Gen Williams asserted that insecurity and other socio-economic challenges can only be surmounted if President Muhammadu Buhari takes timely political decisions on the issues so as to prevent them from festering.\n\nThe present state of insecurity in the country has become a source of serious concern. How would you react to the ugly development and what is the way out?\n\nI don\u2019t think we have a problem of insecurity in Nigeria. What we have mostly is problem of public safety. We don\u2019t have insecurity because no nation is engaging us in war. All these problems of kidnapping, and abductions are not that of insecurity but that of public safety. What we have is that the people are not safe. The South West went ahead and created Amotekun, and with the creation of the outfit, security is improving in the South-West. The South East have also created their own which they call Ebubeagu. Some states in the north created Hisbah long time ago. And in every state, there are vigilantes. So there is confusion all over the place as to who is responsible for the public safety. It is for the National Assembly to have a look at the situation and say, with the situation we have in this country now, do we not need to have a law that will remove all these confusions or reduce the confusions to the minimum and remove the issue of vigilantes?\n\nNow that they have set up Amotekun by law in each South-West state, what is left for the National Assembly is to regularise the situation. And for those who are shouting about Amotekun, what is the meaning of Hisbah? Is Hisbah is not a government agency like Amotekun? So why are they crying about Amotekun and they are not talking about Hisbah?\n\nBut I also want to emphasise the importance of community policing. Without community policing, we can\u2019t solve most of these problems. If we don\u2019t have community policing, there is going to be serious problems because the Nigeria Police as presently constituted can\u2019t solve the security challenges facing the country. Again because of the corruption going on in the security agencies, they don\u2019t want any change in the status quo, and it is not their fault. The fault is with Mr President.\n\nBuhari should have given a marching order to those in charge of the nation\u2019s security architecture, giving them an ultimatum on the security issues, especially kidnapping, and banditry. The nation\u2019s present security architecture is not working. Those in charge of our security system are not working. They are incompetent.\n\nAnytime kidnapping or abduction happen, the President will address Nigerians and give assurance that the situation is under control but the situation continues getting worse. They keep on holding security meetings but nothing is improving. They keep on spending billions of naira on security but nothing is improving. This is why I\u2019m happy about the recent Southern governors meeting. I\u2019m happy that they eventually met and took far reaching decisions at the end of their meeting. Looking at the situation of things in the country, at times it appears as if nobody is in charge. Buhari has refused to take decisions, often crucial decisions that can help to move the nation forward. As the Commander-in \u2013chief, Buhari has enormous powers to make things happen but he seems not to be keen on doing the needful. We need to re-organise the nation\u2019s security architecture, if we do this, we will see positive results manifesting. But only Buhari knows why he is not taking the right actions.\n\nAre you saying President Buhari is not doing what he supposed to do?\n\nIf he has done what he was supposed to do, are we going to be in this kind of situation now? We will not be. There is no doubt about that. Everybody all over the country has told him and even if he doesn\u2019t read newspapers, somebody must have told him about what is happening in the country. So the issue is, he knows what is happening and if you tell him something is happening, he would say we are going to deal with them but that is the end of the story. There is no strategy at all.\n\nThis is what is very funny about the presidential system. The people turn the president to a semi-god, who has answers to all the problems. It is a big mistake. That is why he has advisers but unfortunately one single man will take responsibility. If he is old and sick what do you expect and if he has bad advisers and he cannot sack them, then that man is compounding problems for himself. If you are the president and there are so many problems going all over the place, it means your advisers are not in touch nor are they well informed enough to be able to advise you on what action to take. What do you do? You change them for some other people who can do a better job. But he did not and the problem keeps compounding itself and he continues to fill the same people and there is more problem.\n\nOn the lingering Boko Haram war, how do we win the battle against the insurgency which has been going on for almost 20 years?\n\nIt appears Buhari\u2019s government is no longer keen about the war. They will just continue like that until they hand over to another government in 2023. They are no longer giving the insurgency the attention it deserves, and that\u2019s why they are not tackling it with all the seriousness it deserves. Buhari\u2019s government is more bothered about handing over the war against the insurgents to another government in 2023.\n\nBuhari inherited Boko-Haram war, and so he also wants to pass it to another government. Buhari\u2019s government is not serious about defeating Boko Haram. If this government is keen on winning the Boko-Haram war, the military needs to be re-organised. It is also obvious that the morale is very low among the troops. The military has enough equipment and enough men to be able to defeat Boko Haram but they also need to deploy the right tactics. Secondly, the military are dissipating all their energies on the job which the mobile police should be doing .It is not their business to be fighting bandits and kidnappers. It is not their business to be protecting the highways. The military should focus primarily on fighting the insurgents in the North-East. They should be re-organised properly and focus on the war against Boko Haram. Intelligence gathering is also key to winning the war against the insurgents. Our military should be involved in more of intelligence gathering and counter-intelligence. I believe that with the right strategies, and the morale being high among our troops then taming the insurgents should not be a problem.\n\nOn 2023, where do you stand between merit and zoning?\n\nMy position is this: we should retain zoning as it has been in practice since 1999. Merit is okay but for equity and justice, and for the sake of the nation\u2019s unity, we should not jettison zoning. My take is that the two political parties \u2013 APC and PDP -should zone the Presidency to the South, and when they do that they should take it to the South-East. It should be the turn of the South-East, having being the only zone yet to have it since 1999. The people of the South-East should now ensure that they pick people of integrity as candidates.\n\nFears are being expressed that the 2023 elections may not hold as a result of the present state of insecurity. Do you harbour such concerns?\n\nFor those expressing fears about whether 2023 elections will hold or not, I don\u2019t see any reason for that. Although there have been attacks on INEC offices across the country, especially in the South-East, I don\u2019t think the situation is dire enough to warrant a postponement. Even with on-going war against insurgency in the North, that is not enough an excuse to postpone the polls.\n\nSome have expressed fear that recent agitations for self-determination by some groups could lead to the break-up of the country. What\u2019s your take?\n\nThere is nothing new or strange about people talking about self-determination. That happens all over the world. There is nothing new about that. There is no country in the world where people are satisfied with the status quo. People always clamour for change. As for Nigeria breaking up, I don\u2019t believe in it. What we need to do is to address various challenges confronting us as a nation. I don\u2019t believe in secession. What we need to do to stop all these agitations here and there if for us to restructure.\n\nRestructuring will go a long way in addressing bottled grievances among the various ethnic groups across the country. We should return to the true practice of federalism as practised in the First Republic Constitution. I don\u2019t know why this government appears to be foot-dragging on the issue of restructuring. The point is this, there is no alternative to restructuring. Even the President\u2019s own party, APC set up a committee on the issue headed by Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai which recommended restructuring. Almost everybody is now clamouring for it. Even at the recent meeting of the Southern governors, restructuring was one of their key demands for moving the nation forward. Whether we like it or not, there is no alternative to it, and running away from it is like postponing the evil day.\n\nThe APC came to office promising to transform the country, but some Nigerians are saying that nothing has actually changed. Do you agree?\n\nThe whole system has not changed at all. So when the president is talking that there has been improvements, nothing has changed for Nigeria under Buhari\u2019s leadership. And then you look at the case of corruption. Look at the EFCC, look at the ICPC, they have a backload of cases. They were told by so many people to establish a corruption tribunal, a special corruption tribunal. That has been over two years ago. They have been talking about it but the National Assembly has kicked against it. Nobody is fighting corruption. Corruption has been on the increase, and there is nothing Buhari can do about it. Forget about anybody saying Buhari fighting corruption. There is nothing Buhari can do about it. It is not the same Buhari that Nigerians used to know in the days of the military that is the Buhari that we have today.\n\nConcerns are being expressed over the high rate at which the Federal Government is taking foreign loans. What\u2019s your reaction to that?\n\nIt is alarming, and very worrisome. They are mortgaging the future of coming generations. But the point is this: we can never develop. We will continue to borrow money and part of this money will be going to private pockets and people\u2019s accounts all over the world. People are running away from Europe now, but they are putting their money into accounts in the Middle East, Dubai and all those places in the United Arab Emirates. Look at disciplined services like the Armed Forces. They changed the Head of the Armed Forces and those who came after them say the money you gave our predecessor to buy weapons, we can\u2019t found the weapons now. And what did they do? They appointed them as ambassadors! Where in this world can you see that? And the same people now and the same corrupt National Assembly is now asking us to set up a Public Trust Fund for the Armed Forces like they have done for the police. They give out mobile policemen to guide individuals. They pay the police for the services of the mobile police. Is that money part of the police budget? It is not. Where does the money go? It is shared. Or where does the money go if it is not shared and they are not part of the police budget? And when you ask the police, they will say they have no money. But I have not seen any Inspector General of Police or head of any agency that is poor.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s former Ambassador to Ukraine, Ibrahim Kasai, has charged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the 2023 presidency to the South in the spirit of common sense, fairness, equity and justice. Kasai, a member of the Board of Trustees, Buhari/Osinbajo Campaign Organisation, also lamented that President Muhammadu Buhari has not rewarded many people who worked hard to actualise his emergence as president in 2015 and 2019. He spoke with GYANG BERE in Jos.\n\nAre you satisfied with the way the president has been running the country?\n\nWell, I am happy with the infrastructural development, but I am not satisfied with the security problems that we are having in the country. It is disturbing and part of it was when the president changed the service chiefs. We had some ray of hope that maybe the security architecture will change the style of their assignment. We are hoping that good results would be achieved. We know that there is a general economic problem, but many politicians, including myself are not too happy because of neglect. Compensation is an important embodiment of politics. There is no need to pretend about it. The Buhari administration should look for people that have been left out. The President needs to look for a way of reaching to certain people that have been neglected out of this government. You can\u2019t give everybody job but there is much job to be done, some people are there telling the President that there is no money, but wealth is created using creativity. Even jobs for our youths. It is the brain that creates the jobs.\n\nHow much are other tiers of government doing to complement the Federal Government in terms of generating internal revenue? We don\u2019t need to fold our arms and wait for allocation from the federation account. Look at the IGR of states for instance. How much do you think states should be generating? Everybody should hold his constituency and say, let me do my best in revenue generation. If that is done, we will move somewhere. But it looks as if since there is oil money, everybody is folding his arms to wait for it. We should know that the days of oil have gone. So the question of abandoning people for lack of money to pay allowances is not fair. There are some agencies that you can\u2019t run them without board members. It is a crime to run an agency without a board. It is not in the architecture of government to run universities, polytechnics and some agencies without boards. Somebody must supervise. Why was Balarabe Musa removed as governor? He didn\u2019t commit any crime, but that he used Permanent Secretaries to take decisions instead of appointing commissioners. So for that breach of the constitution, he was removed from office. Many people have been waiting since 2015 and they have not been appointed. I am one of them, I am not saying this because I am affected but so many people are out there waiting to be appointed.\n\nNone of the major political parties, the APC and the PDP have come out to say the presidential seat should be zoned to any zone. But based on the principles of common sense, where do you think the presidency should be zoned in 2023?\n\nI do much believe in the theory of common sense and I saw on social media recently that the APC has zoned the presidential seat to the South, although I don\u2019t know how authentic that is. But if that is true, it is a good development. That has been my advocacy. By common sense, presidency should go to the South. For PDP, they have an instrument that alternates the zones between the North and South. When we were in PDP, we know of that but if they are changing now, it is okay for them. It is my idea that such zoning arrangements should come to play. If it is true that APC has zoned the presidency to the South, it is a step in the right direction. It will be fair that presidency should go to the South in 2023.\n\nBut we have seen Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi, North Central moving round the country to solicit support for his presidential ambition?\n\nIf it is true that the presidency has been zoned to the South, then it will be wrong for him to come out because that will contradict that zoning arrangement. He is not a small member in the party. A governor is respected in the party and I think he should know better. Although I have not seen any document or heard a pronouncement from the leaders of the party that the presidency has been zoned to the South, but if what I saw on the social media is true, then it will not be right for anybody from the North to come out. Some jokers can come out, if they want to test their popularity. You cannot stop him. He can print posters and start campaigning, but I don\u2019t think he can be screened to contest by the party.\n\nWill you advise the APC constitution review committee to make zoning an official policy of the party?\n\nThat might be outside the constitution. I don\u2019t think it should be a constitutional matter. Certain decisions are taken by the Board of Trustees, because their main function is to give directive to the party and to hold in trust the property of the party. That is usually done after exhaustive consultations so that the country will move in the right direction. I also don\u2019t know if that is part of the scope of the assignment of the committee. And if that is part of it, fine, they can go ahead and incorporate zoning in the APC constitution.\n\nWhat should be done to encourage internal democracy and fairness within the APC ahead of 2023?\n\nYou will recall that in our previous engagement, I have always talked about the constitution of the party. A constitution is a working document that guides likeminded individuals. And as a political party like the ruling APC, it needs a solid and enduring constitution because a political party in Nigeria that has produced a president is not a small group. When I heard that a committee has been set up to review the party\u2019s constitution, I was the happiest person because that is what I have been talking on. If you look at the existing document, you will laugh and wonder whether the party has been serious at all because there are so many flaws and definitely the construction needs a review. We are getting to another election and you can\u2019t face the national convention of the party without a fresh, reviewed party constitution for the people to be approved. A national convention is a gathering of party members where critical and very important decisions are taken for the party. I was impressed when I heard of the composition of the committee, which is made up of very important legal luminaries and I believe they will do justice to the assignment and to Nigerians. I believe they will come up with a very solid party constitution.\n\nWhat sections of the constitution will you advise them to review to ensure fairness in the party?\n\nFirstly, in membership, and secondly on sustainability of the party on power. There are so many other aspects, but majorly the methodology of handling critical aspects of the party, that is the congress and engaging candidates on contesting election. A selection process is very critical to a political party. If you don\u2019t have a very good selection process, you will spend the whole of your time on litigation. The party will be taking its members to court and the members also taking the party to court. The leaders with be dishing out sanctions against misdeeds if the party is not firm on a matter. For instance, when it comes to the selection of the president or a governor of a state, the primaries that will produce a presidential candidate, governorship candidate or senatorial candidate, if the decision is not firm, there will be problem. The present constitution says candidates can be selected through direct or indirect primaries and that is too ambiguous. Some people can explore that and do what they want. A state chapter can decide to influence a decision to go the way of those who have money in the party. If you say indirect primaries, if you don\u2019t have money, you can\u2019t win that type of election. But if you say direct primaries, it means the entire congress and every party member can participate in the selection of who represent them as president, governor or in other elective positions and that promotes internal democracy. If you don\u2019t promote internal democracy, there is no way democracy will grow in Nigeria and that is what many members of the APC are saying.\n\nAre you saying that APC should produce the 2023 presidential candidate of the party through internal democracy by allowing Nigerians to participate in the primaries?\n\nOf course, that is what I am advocating. Let the people participate in the selection of who will represent them as president, governor, senators and so on. That makes the system participatory and that will show that democracy is at work. That is what we call political engineering. You say indirect primaries, those who are going in are nominated by somebody sitting down somewhere. Either he is in a position of influence, or because he is rich or for other reasons, they will give directives that, go to that local government, get five persons. You move to another and get the same and you will have a gathering of handpicked individuals and they will select who they want. And that will produce corruption, nepotism and all sorts of things and you will come up with a candidate not representing the people. Indirect election is better done when selecting the leadership of the National Assembly. The people don\u2019t go there to do it for them. The 360 of them are already elected by the people and the members can select who lead them and if they hold election and whoever becomes speaker, deputy speaker and so on, that is their business. They understand the language better. Nobody will be there to guide them on what to do. But for a common man to be excluded from the selection of the president he wants from the grassroots is not fair. And the body language of people in the party is towards direct primaries. If you consult any APC member who knows what he is doing, he will tell you that direct primaries are the best for the party.\n\nBut some would say they prefer indirect primaries?\n\nThat process is fading out. Indirect primaries are becoming archaic. People are disenchanted with that. Nigerians can attest to it that either in APC or PDP, wherever they say indirect primaries, you will see people going with bags of money to buy delegates. There is no point hiding it. The issue of buying delegates is what corrupts our political system.\n\nMinister of Communications, Isa Pantami, who reportedly made certain provocative statements in the past, is still serving in Buhari\u2019s cabinet. What is your take?\n\nI also read that in the social media. But sometimes, if you are not sure of the source of information, for you to just comment on it might not be good. But let me say generally that anybody who is linked with such groups should be investigated. No information of such nature should be covered up for any reason.\n\nHow will you advise the president as regards banditry, negotiating with bandits, and so on?\n\nI do know that Mr. President is doing his best in terms of eliminating this banditry and the security agencies are there and they are being attacked and killed. But there are stories of insiders. Sometimes, if you keep things in your house and you discover they are being stolen, if you check well, you will discover that some of the thieves are in your house. What you need to do is to search your house and fish out those bad elements. I am of the view that the various forest reserves that we have should be cut down and new trees planted to replace them. Let\u2019s see where those criminals will be hiding. The Sambisa Forest is large. Let\u2019s see how government will begin to bring down the trees for security reasons.",

          "text": "\u2022Predicts critics will give a resounding applause by end of tenure in 2023\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nAs the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration clocks six years today, the Presidency has reeled out major achievements of the regime, with a prediction that even known critics of the President would give a resounding applause to the administration when it finally ends on May 29, 2023.\n\nA statement titled: \u201cThe Buhari Administration At Six: Counting The Blessings One By One\u201d, issued yesterday by the Media Adviser to the President, Mr. Femi Adesina, captured the President\u2019s score card under 26 subheads, including extension of over N2 trillion to the 36 states as bail out to pay workers\u2019 salaries and issuance of nine executive orders, as well as assenting to 14 legislative bills.\n\nThe Presidency stressed that the six years of Buhari\u2019s administration afforded it an opportunity to reflect, and recount the impact that had been made, \u201cand is being made on different sectors of national life.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Presidency, the administration is recording giant strides, from infrastructure, to finance, education, healthcare, sports, anti-corruption moves, human development, housing, oil and gas, foreign relations, and many others, enough to make Nigerians proud, \u201cthat is, those who are dispassionate and fair-minded, not beclouded by political partisanship and undue cynicism.\u201d\n\nThe sector by sector breakdown of the achievements of President Buhari from 2015 to 2021, as listed by the Presidency, showed that under infrastructure category, came the Presidential approval, in 2020, for the establishment of InfraCo Plc, a world class infrastructure development vehicle, wholly focused on Nigeria, with combined debt and equity take-off capital of N15 trillion, and managed by an independent infrastructure fund manager.\n\nOther efforts under this category include the establishment in 2020 of the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), with more than $1 billion in funding so far.\n\nOn investment committed to rail transportation in the country, the statement listed the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail nearing completion; the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail which was completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began.\n\nOthers are the Abuja Light Rail, which was completed in 2018; the ground-breaking for construction of Kano-Maradi Standard Gauge Rail, and revamp of Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Narrow Gauge Rail.\n\nIt also listed ongoing financing negotiations for Ibadan-Kano Standard Gauge Rail project.\n\nOn road projects, the statement listed the PIDF, the investment of over a billion dollars on three flagship projects: Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Second Niger Bridge and Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano expressway.\n\nOther efforts in this regards included the Executive Order 7 to mobilise private investment into the development of key roads and bridges like Bodo-Bonny in Rivers and Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki-Ojota in Lagos.\n\nThe Buhari administration, according to the statement, has done well in boosting the capacity of the nation\u2019s ports.\n\nAdesina cited such efforts as the completion of new terminals for International Airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt; Construction of New Runway for Abuja and Enugu International Airports and the Presidential approval for four International Airports at Special Economic Zones: Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt.\n\nOthers include, the approval for new private-sector funded deep sea ports: Lekki Deep Sea Port (construction already well underway, for completion in 2022); Bonny Deep Sea Port (ground-breaking done in March 2021); Ibom Deep Sea Port; and Warri Deep Sea Port. The list includes the development of capacity at the Eastern Ports.\n\nIn the power sector, Adesina listed President Buhari\u2019s effort to include the implementation of Energising Education Programme, which involves taking clean and reliable energy (Solar and Gas) to Federal Universities and Teaching Hospitals across the country. Projects in four Universities have been completed and commissioned: BUK (Kano), FUNAI (Ebonyi), ATBU (Bauchi) and FUPRE (Delta). Others are ongoing.\n\nHe listed another achievement to include the National Mass Metering Programme, which involves the nationwide rollout of electricity meters to all on-grid consumers, launched in August 2020.\n\nListed as achievements were the ground-breaking on 614km Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Gas Project, successful completion of Nigeria\u2019s first Marginal Field Bid Round in almost 20 years, expected to raise in excess of half a billion dollars.\n\nThe achievements also included the Policy, Regulatory and Funding Support for the establishment of Modular Refineries across the Niger Delta.\n\nOn agriculture, the administration maintained that the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, has made more than N300 billion loans to more than 3.1 million smallholder farmers of 21 different commodities (including Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Cassava, Poultry, Soya Beans, Groundnut, Fish), cultivating over 3.8 million hectares of farmland.\n\nIt noted that the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has helped anti-corruption agencies devise clearer strategies for obtaining forfeiture of assets suspected to have been acquired fraudulently, mainly from State coffers, before prosecuting suspected culprits.\n\nThe Presidency noted that the administration had been able to secure billions of dollars in concessional infrastructure funding for critical road and rail projects. It noted, for instance, that President Buhari\u2019s April 2016 official visit to China has unlocked billions of dollars in infrastructure funding, primarily for road, rail and port projects, as well as the implementation of a Chinese Yuan (CNY) 15 billion Currency Swap Agreement between the Peoples Bank of China and the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nIt noted that the administration had been able to secure international recognition within the period of six years and this include the designation of President Buhari as the African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption Champion for 2018, and by ECOWAS Heads of State as West Africa\u2019s COVID-19 Champion in 2020.\n\nIt also listed the appointments of eminent Nigerians into international posts.

          "text": "\u2022Says he was selected based on national interest, not on ethnic, religious sentiments\n\n\u2022New COAS resumes, Irabor charges him to build on Attahiru\u2019s legacy\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Kingsley Nweze in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday defended its choice of Major General Farouk Yahaya as the new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), while also revealing plans to immortalise the former COAS, late General Ibrahim Attahiru and others that perished in a plane crash about a week ago in Kaduna State.\n\nDefending its choice, the government insisted that contrary to public opinion, the appointment of Yahaya, who resumed duty yesterday, was based on national interest and not on ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, charged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash on Friday, May 21.\n\nThe appointment of the new COAS on Thursday had elicited fierce criticisms from a wide spectrum of Nigerians who alleged that other more qualified senior army generals were denied the position because they hailed from the south-eastern part of the country.\n\nCritics also argued that the office of Army Chief had been restricted to Northerners in the six years Buhari has spent so far as President and that the President ought to have shifted a bit by picking the new Army Chief from among Southern Generals in the Army, so as to give the rest of the country a sense of belonging.\n\nApparently reacting to the criticisms yesterday, the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi said the appointment of Yahaya was strategic and was based on national interest and not on ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\nThe Minister, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mohammad Abdulkadri, described the new Army Chief as \u201can organic infantry general who is tested and trusted to actualise the national aspirations to restore peace in the dark spots and areas of insurgency, kidnapping, and banditry, as well as other allied threats to the nation\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nMagashi commended President Buhari \u201cfor the well thought-out strategic appointment of Yahaya as a replacement for the late Attahiru.\n\n\u201cWith the appointment of General Yahaya, President Buhari has expediently put national interest above ethnic and religious chauvinism by fulfilling all requirements necessary. These include his unblemished track records of service, professional, command, and operational competencies among other yardsticks that culminated into his emergence as most suitably qualified new Army boss.\u201d\n\nThe Defence Minister expressed optimism in the professional pedigree of General Yahaya, the former theatre Commander Operation \u201cHadin Kai\u201d, in sustaining the trajectory of taking offensive and aggressive campaigns to the camps, corridors, and cells of the adversaries to obliterate them.\n\nWhile pledging the support of the Ministry of Defence under his watch to the new Army boss in carrying out his mandate, the minister said plans were in the pipeline by the federal government to immortalise the late General Attahiru and others who died in the plane crash.\n\nYahaya is from Sokoto State and he was a member of the 37th Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy.\n\nThe choice of Yahaya, according to independent analysis, means Nigeria would lose heavy investments made on about 60 army generals from the Army Regular Courses 35 and 36, who, by army tradition, have to proceed on summary retirement as a result of the choice of the new COAS, who belongs to the course 37 set.\n\nYahaya Resumes\n\nMeanwhile, General Yahaya formally resumed duty as the nation\u2019s Chief of Army Staff yesterday.\n\nHe took over during a ceremony held at the Army Headquarters in Abuja, where on arrival, he inspected a guard of honour at the sentry, thereafter, he proceeded to the conference room.\n\nBefore the commencement of the programme, he led others to observe a minute silence in honour of his late predecessor and 10 others, who died in the plane crash.\n\nA statement by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Mohammed Yerima, said the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff was received at the Army Headquarters by the Chief of Policy and Plans (COPP) Army, Maj Gen BI Ahanotu and thereafter inspected a quarter guards mounted in his honour and the symbolic lowering and hoisting of command flag to signify the end and beginning of a new command in line with army traditions.\n\n\u201cGeneral Yahaya later held a brief meeting with principal staff officers after observing a minute silence in honour of former COAS, late General Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 others. He requested maximum cooperation of the senior officers in order to achieve the mandate of safeguarding the country from the multifaceted security challenges facing the country\u201d, the statement said.\n\nThe COAS further stressed \u201cteam work and synergy as the way forward for the Nigerian Army and the nation as no single individual or agency can make it alone\u201d.\n\nBuild on the Legacy of Attahiru, Irabor Charges New Army Chief\n\nMaking a point of what he expects, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, yesterday charged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, describing his appointment as well-deserved.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Acting Director Defence Information, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, Irabor gave the charge when he hosted the new COAS at the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), Abuja on resumption of duty.\n\n\u201cI urge you to build on the legacy of your predecessor, particularly in the fight against insurgency and armed banditry,\u201d declared the CDS.\n\nThe statement from the DHQ continues: \u201cThe CDS also wished him a successful tenure in office as he assumes command. General Irabor further urged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, particularly in the fight against insurgency and banditry.\u201d The COAS was accompanied on the visit by the Chief of Policy and Plans Headquarters Nigerian Army, Maj Gen Benjamin Ahanotu.\n\nHighlight of the visit was the presentation of Nigerian Army flag to the new COAS by the CDS, Brigadier General Nwachukwu said in the statement.\n\nPresident Buhari appointed Gen. Yahaya as the COAS on Thursday, May 27, 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The estimated value of houses for the former Minister of Petroleum, Diezani Allison is worth $80 million\u201d.\n\nBawa attributed the delay in disposing of the assets to long court processes and administrative exigencies.\n\nHe pointed out that with the setting up of the committee by the government, all assets recovered by the EFCC, as well as those recovered by other authorised agencies would be disposed of quickly.\n\nThe EFCC Chairman assured that once all recovered assets were disposed of, the Commission would be dealing with issues on a case by case basis and would not let them accumulate again.\n\nThe chairman of the committee opined that it was not ideal to continue keeping such recoveries as they were losing value over time.\n\nAdeogun said, \u201cGiven the financial situation of Nigeria, shouldn\u2019t we just auction these things fast and put the money to use.

          "text": "Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja and Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday dismissed the appeal of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the alleged certificate forgery against Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki.\n\nThe apex court in a unanimous judgment held that the appellants failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe APC and one of its chieftains, Williams Edobor, had appealed the judgment of the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal, which had dismissed their case of certificate forgery against Obaseki on the grounds that the allegations were not proved.\n\nHowever delivering judgment in the appeal, the apex court just like the appellate and trial courts held that the appellants failed woefully in their case having not provided any disclaimer from the school that the said result was not issued by it.\n\nThe apex court in the judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, also agreed with the lower courts that the appellants did not meet sufficient requirement of the law in proving their allegations.\n\nThe court accordingly upheld two judgments of the Court of Appeal Abuja and the Federal High Court, Abuja, which had earlier dismissed the case of the appellants for lacking in merit.\n\nThe court in addition awarded a cost of N1 million in favour of Obaseki.\n\nReacting to the judgment, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) hailed the judgement of the Supreme Court which upheld the election of Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, describing it as the inevitable triumph of the will of the people over anti-democratic forces.\n\nAlso, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, described the Nigeria Judiciary as the referee of Nigeria\u2019s democracy through enforcement of the rule of law, to protect the minorities from the power of the majority, despite their attempts to tilt the playing field against the rules.\n\nThe Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal had on March 18, dismissed the appeal of the APC seeking to upturn the judgment of Justice Ahmed Mohammed of a Federal High Court, Abuja which dismissed the case of the plaintiff on grounds of abundant evidence that the certificates Obaseki tendered to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were genuine and issued by relevant authorities.\n\nAPC in the suit was seeking the sack of Obaseki as governor on grounds that he forged documents he submitted to INEC in aid of his qualification for the 2020 governorship election in Edo State.\n\nThe 3-man panel did not only dismiss the appeal of the APC for being incompetent and lacking in merit but went ahead to award the sum of N250, 000 as cost in favour of Obaseki.\n\nJustice Stephen Adah had in the judgment held that the lower court was right in its findings and conclusion in the APC suit.\n\nThe appellate court also upheld the testimony of the Deputy Registrar, Legal, Mr. Abayomi Ajayi who confirmed that Obaseki attended University of Ibadan in 1976 and fulfilled the requirement for admission into the institution.\n\nAdah added that the evidence of the Deputy Registrar was direct in showing that Obaseki did not forge his University of Ibadan certificate submitted to INEC and as such fulfilled all requirements to contest for the governorship position of Edo State.\n\nThe trial court had on January 9 this year dismissed the alleged certificate forgery suit against Obaseki, on grounds that the party failed to substantiate its claim of forgery.\n\nBut not satisfied APC approached the Appeal Court to challenge the judgment of the lower court.\n\nThe PDP asserted that the verdict of the apex court in throwing out the petition of APC was a resounding reinforcement of the popularity of the PDP and Governor Obaseki in Edo State, as firmly established in the election.\n\nThe party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, urged Governor Obaseki to continue in his commitment towards the development of the state and the well-being of his people in line with the manifesto and ideology of the PDP; the very reason he was overwhelmingly re-elected as governor of the state.\n\nThe PDP said that it was proud of Governor Obaseki for the empowerment of the people as well as massive infrastructural development of Edo State in critical areas of healthcare, education, agriculture and food production, oil and gas, industrialisation among others.\n\nThe party also commended the judiciary for its courage in upholding justice and the will of the people in the Edo governorship election.\n\nShaibu while reacting said, \u201cThe ruling of the Supreme Court today has shown that the judiciary does not lack teeth. The rule of law is the strong pillar and rock on which Nigeria\u2019s democracy stands. Every other foundation is made of sinking sand because the judiciary is no longer bound by artificial limitations.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary constitutes the most important vessel in the sustenance of democracy in Nigeria, even as he reminded politicians that the Supreme Court is not a systematic instrument for the acquisition of political power.\n\n\u201cThe final judgement today has demonstrated to the World that the Nigerian Judiciary is not a pawn in the hands of desperate politicians to realise their ambition. The rule of law has prevailed and this has demonstrated further that no one can sit above the law. Justice is the greatest interest of man and the ligament which binds civilised people together. Today\u2019s judgement has reinforced this saying due to the celebration all over Edo State and other parts of the World.\n\n\u201cThe extent to which the Nigeria Judiciary is free to perform it\u2019s roles and efficiently too, will determine how developed and how deep rooted our Democracy will be.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nokia X20 Review \u2013 Dualsight Camera, 2-day battery life, and more",
          "text": "The Nokia X20 is your chance to use a high end smartphone with many features that are likely to help with your content creation, gaming, and overall selfie experience.\n\nEarly in April, HMD Global announced the launch of six new Nokia Android smartphones. I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin : personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\n: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin. There are the warranty papers but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for is it? Thought as much. Onward!\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

          "text": "This Friday, May 28th at 11 am, Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media will be speaking with Adeoluwa Akomolafe \u2013 Chief Information Security Officer, Wema Bank; Daniel Osineye \u2013 Co-founder and CTO, Evolve Credit and Joseph Onyema \u2013 Group Chief Information Officer at United Capital Group; Sophina Kio-Lawson, Co-founder at SheSecures and Nick Maxwell \u2013 General Manager, Ava Security (UK, MEA & ANZ).\n\nAdeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick will be discussing how you can protect your organization and customers from online fraud.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nEvery year, there\u2019s an increase in the number of people connected to the internet, but this means there\u2019s also a corresponding increase in the number of people who are susceptible to cyberattacks. In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional.

          "title": "GovTech In Nigeria: From Regulatory Maze to Models of Good Practice",
          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "title": "How GOtv Nigeria Built the Widest Coverage in Nigeria with Investments in Local Infrastructure",
          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would retire the Internet Explorer (IE) on June 15, 2022.\n\nLaunched globally in August 1995, Internet Explorer became the most widely used web browser with about 95% market share between 2002 and 2003. And in 2015, it was already one of Africa\u2019s most used web browsers.\n\nDespite being the pioneering Internet browser, its security, speed, and reliability have been the butt of jokes for a few years now. Maybe that\u2019s why Microsoft has decided to pull the plug on the browser\u2019s life support.\n\nDue to its longevity, no other software has had more security bugs than Internet Explorer before 2019. Its users are prone to get tricked by hackers into opening malicious websites from search queries or clicking on an email link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Microsoft reportedly confirmed a security flaw in January 2020, the company said it had no immediate plan to fix the defect used by hackers on IE until they released a new update in February of that year.\n\nIn January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 after announcing that it wouldn\u2019t offer security updates for Windows users in January 2019.\n\nDespite the patches rolled out almost every month, its security and low network connectivity, which make it unreliable, do not inspire confidence.\n\nThat explains why some users started looking for alternatives.\n\n\u201cInternet Explorer was the go-to to download Chrome back in the day. I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity. Approximately 7 people (5.8%) stopped because of security bugs, and about 29 people (24.2%) said they never used it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it appears some Nigerians won\u2019t miss the browser when Microsoft eventually puts it to rest.\n\nNonetheless, while Internet Explorer was going through its steady decline in market share, and Google Chrome dominated other browsers with 69% market share, Microsoft was building Microsoft Edge to replace IE.\n\nWhat about Microsoft Edge?\n\nWith the Microsoft Edge browser launch in 2015, the software giant revealed plans to kill off Internet Explorer, though it would continue working until the end.\n\nRecall that on August 17, 2020, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Teams web app would no longer support IE. And on November 30 of the same year, Microsoft Teams stopped endorsing IE.\n\nFrom August 17, 2021, Microsoft services like OneDrive and Outlook will no longer support IE.\n\nInterestingly, Edge has an IE mode despite being touted as faster, more secure, modern, and reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThe IE mode is built in to access the legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications directly from the browser.\n\nMicrosoft also claims that Edge is its solution to the security issues faced on Internet Explorer over the years.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, approximately 579 password attacks are attempted every second. And with reportedly the highest-rated protection against malware and phishing attacks, Microsoft Edge seems to be up to the task of protection.\n\nAccording to browser statistics, Edge can identify 98% of phishing sites while Chrome and Firefox can successfully recognise 96%.\n\nMicrosoft Edge promises to give out security patches for instant vulnerabilities within hours compared to the monthly security patches on IE 11.\n\nAccording to research, Edge can immediately block 89% of phishing sites, outperforming Chrome (79%) and Firefox (77%). This suggests that Edge is more secure than Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.\n\nIn the blog post released on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, Microsoft said, \u201cthe future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge.\u201d\n\nBut how much of this do users believe?\n\n\u201cI enjoy using Microsoft Edge, and it\u2019s better than Chrome because it helps me retrieve my previous tabs whenever I log in again. Also, whenever I want to read, I can use the Immersive Reader. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading on AnyBooks,\u201d says Damilola*, a Microsoft Edge user who never used IE.\n\nAccording to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies, Chrome ranked first with 69.28% market share, while Microsoft Edge ranked second with 7.75% between November 2019 and April 2021.\n\nNew Edge Features\n\nOn Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Microsoft announced two new features for version 91 of the Edge browser at its annual Build conference.\n\nStartup boost allows Edge to start up almost immediately. The second feature \u2014 sleeping tabs \u2014 puts your tabs to sleep so that they don\u2019t use up memory and the CPU cycle.\n\nWith the new Edge features and the retirement of Internet Explorer in June 2022, Microsoft might finally build a reliable brand known for speed and security and probably overtake Chrome some years down the road.\n\nIn Africa, according to Browser Usage Statistics, 68.37% use Chrome while 1.26% use IE and Edge, respectively. However, chrome is still the most vulnerable web browser in 2019, with 177 vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThat is, even with its vulnerabilities, people still chose Chrome over Edge.\n\nSo, what might prompt Africans to use Edge more? The reliability of a browser that hasn\u2019t passed the test of time? How much work do you think Edge has to do to catch up with Chrome? We are also asking the same questions.\n\n* Not real name\n\nFeatured Image by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations? Read\n\nWhat you need to know, as Kenya moves to outlaw pornography.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re following\n\nDubai is a paradise for \u201cdigital nomads\u201d \u2014 and hell for low-wage gig workers.

          "title": "How insecurity blights gains of Nigeria\u2019s 22-year democracy",
          "text": "Nigeria returned to civil rule in 1999 after several years of military occupation of power stool. Today marks exactly 22 years since the transition took place.\n\nFrom President Olusegun Obasanjo to the late Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, Goodluck Jonathan and to the current President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria has recorded some appreciable achievements, particularly in the area of telecommunication, agriculture and infrastructure (for instance, there has been a lot of investment in rail transportation).\n\nBut these achievements appear to have been dwarfed by the high level of insecurity in the country and worsening disunity among the different ethnic nationalities in the country, leading to agitation for restructuring.\n\nAyo Adebanjo, a chieftain of the pan-Yoruba cultural association, Afenifere, said there was nothing to celebrate.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to celebrate for now; rather we are mourning the dream of our forefathers; all the problems bedevilling Nigeria now had been settled before independence until the military came in 1966. What is the problem now? It is the problem of creation of local government autonomy, revenue allocation, I mean true federalism?\n\n\u201cEven revenue and how it would be shared. These issues have been sorted before independence, before the military came and that was why we had the 1963 Constitution. It is the 1963 Constitution that takes care of all these issues caused by the British amalgamation of 1914. Except you want to fool us, these current exercises would not bring anything good,\u201d Adebanjo said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen we say let\u2019s change the 1999 Constitution we are not talking nonsense. If Buhari has no hidden agenda, let him return us to true federalism, which is the solution. If you don\u2019t agree with Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s constitutional conference why don\u2019t you set up your own? The current constitution is fraudulent and it is the source of our problems. You are asking a legislature that was created by the fraudulent constitution to amend the law and expect something good. We are under a dictator regime. For some of us who fought for the independence of the country, it is sad.\u201d\n\nTade Ademola, Lagos State chairman, Inter-Party Advisor Council (IPAC), said: \u201cWhen there\u2019s relative peace, development is assured; progress is constant and planning is simpler. The insecurity has taken us back many years. And this has affected Nigeria in all its ramifications. This insecurity has changed so many things, including hyping the restructuring agitations which has snowballed into ethnic groups ready to leave Nigeria. Nigeria is at the lowest ebb now.\u201d\n\nLanre Oyegbola, politician, is of the view that Nigeria is not where it could be, saying, \u201cWe surely can be much better than this and we surely have what it takes to be better. I am more persuaded that with the rise in more forthright Nigerians getting involved in the affairs of Nigeria and in the politics of who governs Nigeria at different levels, we are surely going to be tilting the clock positively.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cInsecurity, no doubt, has been with us for like forever, and it\u2019s become more pronounced in recent days and years, but we must also accept that the hype around insecurity and the stereotyping around the whole matter are not doing the country any good.\n\n\u201cIn all, I wish we keep Nigeria democratic by engaging our political elite to work for the interest of all and evolve a process that is competence and character-focused. This will ensure we put round pegs in round holes and avoid the trap of doing politics the same old way and expect a different result.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Rising insecurity amid humongous security votes\n\nFrom North East, considered as the epicenter of insecurity, the challenge is now across the country in different shades.\n\nBut it would be recalled that early this year, when President Buhari finally listened to Nigerians and changed the military Service Chiefs, who many insisted were incompetent, there was respite as Nigerians and the world at large hoped for improvement in the country\u2019s security, which has worsened over the years.\n\nIn his excitement over the appointment of the new Service Chiefs, Abdulai Yeri, a retired Army Colonel, and now APC chieftain in Bauchi State, assured that he knew Ibrahim Attahiru, the then new Chief of Army Staff, as a no-nonsense man and that he and team would deliver.\n\nSadly, the fresh air anticipated by many, courtesy of the new appointments, did not happen as was evident in the last four months of the new Service Chiefs, with little or no feat at making Nigeria safe for the citizens to live in.\n\nIf the country had made any progress in the last four months of the new Service Chiefs, the recent death of the chief of army staff in an air crash is a big setback to the fight against insecurity as many suspected foul play in his death.\n\n\u201cFor over five years, somebody has been shouting in Benue that they are killing his people and nothing has happened since. People die in Plateau every day, there is strategic killing now in South East, residents of Borno have since relocated, many more are leaving as those who remain are being killed. Is the bloodshed not enough, is the Federal Government waiting until some tribes are wiped off before responding?\u201d Bem Ujah, an Abuja-based lawyer, cried out.\n\nThe forensic lawyer further lamented that the Federal Government is not helping the matter with its inaction.\n\n\u201cHow can people keep crying out to you, who is elected and also sworn in to protect them, yet you sleep comfortably and only send a message to console them after each attack when you can flush out the killers. I think Nigeria is far from getting solutions to our insecurity challenge until presidency gets serious and accepts the reality,\u201d Ujah said.\n\nWhat worries many observers is the inability of Nigeria to seek help from foreign partners who have successfully addressed their insecurity challenges.\n\n\u201cWhy always asking for loans to build infrastructure that bandits will destroy soon, why not ask for military and intelligence assistance. If you invite the United States of America, it will clear Sambisa forest in a minute, but why are we not getting such helps, Nigerians should protests on this, force presidency to engage foreign powers now\u201d, Freeman Alabo, a security expert and Niger Delta politician said.\n\nFor Alabo, the Federal Government is insincere with the fight against insecurity, especially with insurgence and bandits in the north.\n\n\u201cIf Niger Delta militants make noise now, the Federal Government will send dreaded soldiers with institution to kill at sight, why not do same in the north. You saw the killings in the East because IPOB, if the presidency continues to have soft spot for bandits and insurgence, our security will even get so much out of hand that Aso Rock will not be same. The president should act now and get the help needed,\u201d Alabo advised.\n\nHe thinks that the Nigerian security authorities have been compromised, those ready to work are demoralized by the poor treatment meted on their dead colleagues, while others are resigning to keep their lives.\n\nConsidering the many challenges faced by Nigeria and the need to rejig the security architecture of the country, some observers advised that government should get foreign help now.\n\n\u201cWe need a collaboration of America, Germany, France and others to fight insecurity. But we need to flush out sabotage in the security system and be honest with them in order to get results. No geopolitical zone should hide records to save its dissidents\u201d, Alabo said.\n\nToeing Alabo\u2019s line, Ojobo Ameh, a concerned parent and school principal in Niger State, called on Nigerians to protests in favour of bringing foreign help.\n\nFor now, the only solution to our problem is foreign help because our security is compromised; they are eating from the problem, hence foreign assistance. If this is going to be \u2018#EndInsecurity\u2019 protest let it be because presidency has not responded enough to people\u2019s plights. We are dying shamefully by our brothers\u2019 guns and machetes,\u201d the angry principal said.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL), publishers of the Observer Titles celebrates her 53 years of existence today.\n\nThe Company was established by Late Brigadier General Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia on May 29, 1968 during his tenure as the then Midwest State.\n\nIt was one of the first major attempts to set up a government owned newspaper after independence in 1960\n\nGovernment involvement in setting up media establishment became pronounced with Nigeria independence and subsequently becoming a republic in 1963 with its import of politics in a clearer term.\n\nAfter independence in 1960, the federal government came up with the MORNING AND SUNDAY POST and NEW NIGERIA which grew out of the defunct CITIZEN. The western Region government also established DAILY SKETCH and SUNDAY SKETCH in 1964, while the Midwestern State government set up the Midwest Newspapers Corporation under an edit of December 2, 1967 to produce THE Nigerian OBSERVER newspapers which was first published on May 29, 1968.\n\nThe idea of publishing a government owned Newspaper in the state was first conceived by Colonel Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia\u2019s predecessor, Governor David Ejoor while in office.\n\nThe name of the paper originally planned for the state was \u201cMidwestern Nigeria Sentinel\u201d which was to be a weekly newspaper. The plan to set it up did not materialize before Colonel Ogbemudia was posted to take over as Governor of the then Midwest State.\n\nWithin a brief period of conception, ogbemudia invited Mr Abiodun Aloba in 1967, whom he entrusted the task of helping to set up a state-owned newspaper. Mr Aloba later became the pioneer General Manager of The Nigerian OBSERVER. He had come from Lagos on holiday to Benin City to see his relations. On his way back to Lagos, he was held back by some soldiers, who told him the Military Governor wanted to see him.\n\nOn meeting the Governor, after a brief on the proposal, Aloba was taken to several locations in Benin City with a view of choosing a befitting location for the newspaper company.\n\nHowever, after much search, the governor personally zeroed in on the present site, No. 24 Airport Road, then No. 18 Airport Road; a site which originally belonged to the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nToday, The Nigerian OBSERVER remains the longest surviving government owned newspaper in the country after series of re-launching and re-designing to meet industry standard.\n\nThe Nigerian OBSERVER in 1972 was circulating about 95,000 copies of its editions daily, a number which today has reduced to less than 1000.\n\nLate Fred Opubor, a one time chairman of the company\u2019s Board of Directors blamed the fall in circulation of government owned newspapers on interference on editorial policy.\n\nThe Nigerian OBSERVER was a child of political necessity published as a document for daily circulation that would inform the public on activities of government of the then Midwestern State Fifty-three years after establishment, The Nigerian OBSERVER has to its credit, three editions: Daily, The Sunday OBSERVER and The Weekend OBSERVER on October 6, 1990.\n\nWhile the Sunday OBSERVER was established on October 27,1968, the Sporting OBSERVER (now defunct) was established in 1974 and the Weekend OBSERVER in October 6,1990.\n\nAs at the 4th anniversary of the establishment of the corporation, the daily circulation of The Nigeria OBSERVER throughout the then 12 states of the federation has risen to 95,000, while The Sunday OBSERVER maintained a steady circulation n of 180,000 copies weekly.\n\nFollowing the creation of Edo and Delta States from the then Bendel State in 1991, and subsequently sharing of assets and liabilities by the two states. Edo retained Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL).\n\nThe government of Delta State, on its part, set up Delta Printing Press on August 8, 1994 to produce a state owned newspaper.\n\nThe newspaper which was later known as THE POINTER first appeared on the news stand in October 25, 1994.\n\nIt was set up basically to accommodate staff of the Bendel Newspaper Company Limited who were displaced from the company following the sharing of assets and liabilities by the two states. It was also a newspaper meant to project Delta state with its people to the outside world, as well as bring the world closer to Delta people.\n\nThe publication which started as weekly newspaper that was published every Sunday later added Thursdays and Saturdays (weekend) editions while it is presently a daily publication.\n\nThe basis for establishing THE POINTER newspaper was developmental journalism and grass root enlightenment, specifically patterned along the line of regional newspaper.\n\nWithin the first decade of its existence, the name Midwest Newspaper Corporation was subjected to geo-political changes that affected the political structure at the federal level.\n\nFirstly, it was Midwest Mass Communication Corporation and following the creation of more states, including Bendel from the defunct Midwest State, the corporation\u2019s name was changed to Bendel Newspapers Corporation.\n\nAfter several reforms, in January 1, 1989, in a bid to accentuate its news value and determination, the corporation\u2019s name was changed to Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL), a name which is retained till date.\n\nThe decision to change the name was taken at management level as a means to deliberately strip the company of all elements that made it a parastatal. It was subsequently registered under the Company Allied Matters Act.\n\nDespite the change in the legal status of the company, it is today still owned by government which retained every element of control and management.\n\nAt the inception of Midwest Newspapers Corporation in 1968, the then governor of the state, Colonel Ogbemudia observed that if The Nigerian OBSERVER publication is to discharge its sacred function effectively and efficiently too, it should be free from government control as to what it should write and not write. It should be free to criticize any aspect of government policy which it considered worthy of criticism in public.\n\nNevertheless, The OBSERVER Newspapers thrived in the face of challenges and competitions from privately owned newspapers, to emerge as the longest surviving government owned newspaper in the country.\n\nThe newspaper also had its fair share of unfavorable moments, both during the military regime and civilian government.\n\nA case in point was the case between one Mr. Amakiri Minere (now late) and the then River State governor, Alfred Diette Spiff (now a traditional ruler in Rivers State) in July 1973. Amakiri was the River State correspondent of the Benin \u2013Based The Nigerian OBSERVER. He wrote about an impending Teachers\u2019 strike in River state and had it published on the Military Governor\u2019s birthday anniversary. Diette Spiff felt insulted about the reportage and saw it as well calculated news to embarrass his personality.\n\nThe governor\u2019s ADC, ASP Ralph Micheal Iwowari intervened to pacify his paymaster (Diette) and sent for the reporter. Ignorantly, the reporter appeared at the gate of the governor\u2019s house and was received and detained by soldiers until further orders. The governor ordered and supervised the soldiers shaving of Amakiri\u2019s head with a broken bottle and caned 24 times publicly.\n\nThere was public outcry over the insult and injury caused Amakiri by Governor Diette Spiff and his aides to the extent that Amakiri\u2019s case is today a case study in any discuss on Press Freedom both in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nIn July 22, 1993, General Ibrahim Babagida closed The N igerian OBSERVER newspapers and some other national newspapers for their reportage on the June 12 crisis which he considered as a criticism against his administration.\n\nAside these, in the 1980s, the Newspaper house began to experience some difficulties principally among which was declined readers into the hands of privately owned newspaper until recently when the Editorial appeal was reignited by a vibrant youthful journalist, Mr. Eddy Akpomera. The daily product won back a high number of readers and advertisers who appreciated quality product.\n\nPrior to this period, situation became worse when the then Military Administrator of Edo State, Group Captain Baba Adamu Iyam introduced self- sustenance policy where BNCL and other parastatals were asked to fend for themselves through a Self- Sustenance. Workers of the company started going on incessant strikes as management could not afford workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nThis ugly experience continued until Governor Lucky Nosakhare Igbinedion came to the aid of the company. He cleared off the company\u2019s backlog of 13 months\u2019 salary arrears and employed the services of consultants made up of the duo of Emeka Ogbeide and Orobosa Omo-Ojo who revived the company and put it back on a sound footing.\n\nOn the note of advancing the newspaper house, Edo state Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki after paying an unscheduled visit to The Nigerian OBSERVER, revealed his intention of revamping the state owned media, including The Nigerian OBSERVER with the installation of a state of the art Printing Machine.\n\nHowever, it is on record that the 53 years old Newspaper produced notable journalists some of who made marks in journalism profession, including Mrs. Adekumbi Ero, Nosa Igiebor of TELL magazine, Osa Director, Emma Niboro, Nduka Obaiggbena, publishers of THIS DAY Newspaper.\n\n...",

The TSA system has now been implemented in more than 90 percent of all Federal MDAs.\n\n\u2013 This decision to fully operationalize the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system\u2014a public accounting system that enables the Government to manage its finances (revenues and payments) using a single/unified account, or series of linked accounts domiciled at the Central Bank of Nigeria \u2014 has resulted in the consolidation of more than 17,000 bank accounts previously spread across DMBs in the country, and in savings of an average of N4 billion monthly in banking charges.\n\n\u2013 In spite of great opposition, the Buhari Administration has expanded IPPIS coverage to the Armed Forces, as well as Federal Universities and other academic institutions.\n\nBVN DEPLOYMENT FOR SOCIAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES AND OTHERS:\n\n\u2013 Considering that personnel costs are the Federal Government\u2019s largest expenditure line, the Federal Government has given priority to the deployment of the BVN for payroll and pension audits. The use of BVN to verify payroll entries on the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) platform has so far led to the detection of 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries.\n\n\u2013 The Federal Government has also ensured the deployment of BVN system to serve as the verification basis for payments to beneficiaries and vendors in the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP), the N-Power Scheme and the Homegrown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP)\n\nOPEN GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP\n\n\u2013 In May 2016, President Buhari attended and participated in the International Anti-Corruption Summit organised by the UK Government. At that Summit he pledged that Nigeria would join the OGP, an international transparency, accountability and citizen engagement initiative.\n\n\u2013 In July 2016, Nigeria became the 70th country to join the OGP. Following this, Nigeria constituted an OGP National Steering Committee (NSC), which went on to develop a National Action Plan (2017\u20132019) that aims to deepen and mainstream transparency mechanisms and citizens\u2019 engagement in the management of public resources across all sectors.\n\n\u2013 In 2018, Nigeria was elected to lead the OGP, alongside Argentina, France, and Romania. All four new members of the OGP Steering Committee will serve for three years starting on October 1, 2018.\n\nASSET RECOVERY\n\n\u2013 Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has helped anti-corruption agencies devise clearer strategies for obtaining forfeiture of assets suspected to have been acquired fraudulently, mainly from State Coffers, before prosecuting suspected culprits. Part of this work has involved painstakingly reviewing existing Laws (like the Money Laundering Act, 2004, the EFCC Act, 2004 and the ICPC Act, 2000), to identify and highlight sections directly conferring powers of forfeiture on Nigeria\u2019s anticorruption agencies. This advocacy has led to a significant increase in the use of Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture Mechanisms by anti-corruption agencies\n\n\u2013 ICPC scrutiny of practices, systems and procedures of MDAs\u2019 personnel cost from 2019 to 2020, yielded 189 billion Naira in recoveries from inflated personnel budgets.\n\n\u2013 In 2019 alone ICPC also recovered 32 billion Naira worth of Land, Buildings and Vehicles.\n\n\u2013 ICPC\u2019s audit of Constituency Projects covering 2015 to 2018 helped recover 2 billion Naira of diverted funds and assets.\n\nSECURITY AND JUSTICE REFORM\n\n\u2013 Nigerian Air Force has acquired 26 brand new aircraft since President Buhari assumed office in 2015, and is expecting another 12 (the twelve Super Tucano currently on order from the United States Government, due for delivery starting July 2021). The NAF is also locally re-activating several previously unserviceable planes.\n\n\u2013 The Nigerian Navy has acquired close to 400 new platforms since 2015, including 172 Riverine Patrol Boats (RPBs), 114 Rigid- Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIBs), 2 Seaward Defence Boats (SDBs), 12 Manta Class/Inshore Patrol Craft (IPC), 3 Whaler Boats, 4 Barges / Tug Boats, 22 Fast Attack Boats, 14 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), 4 Helicopters, 14 River Town Class, 14 House Boats and 4 Capital Ships.\n\n\u2013 In line with the President\u2019s directive, the Nigerian Navy has established a Naval Base Lake Chad in Baga, Borno State, as well as deployed 14 Naval Security Stations along the nation\u2019s coastline in areas prone to criminal activity.\n\n\u2013 President Buhari signed into law, in 2019, the Bill establishing the Police Trust Fund, which will significantly improve funding for the Nigeria Police Force.\n\n\u2013 Nigeria Police Force launched a new National Command and Control Center in Abuja in 2019\n\n\u2013 As part of Criminal Justice Reforms, President Buhari in 2020 granted amnesty to 2,600 prisoners nationwide, representing about 3.5 percent of all inmates, in a bid to decongest Nigeria\u2019s prison population. The beneficiaries were those 60 years and above; those suffering from ill-health that might likely lead to death; convicts serving three years and above and have less than six months to serve; inmates with mental health defect; and inmates with a pending fine not exceeding N50,000 and with no pending cases.\n\n\u2013 Presidential approval for commencement of Community Policing Programme nationwide, and release of take-off funding. The Community Policing Programme has now been enshrined into the Police Act, 2020.\n\n\u2013 The Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) is deploying a Migration Information and Data Analysis System (MIDAS) at five International Airports. MIDAS is a global real-time border management system developed by International Organization for Migration (IOM), and is linked to INTERPOL & other watchlists. The implementation of MIDAS at the International Airport in Abuja was described by the IOM as \u201cthe largest deployment of MIDAS at any airport globally, to date.\u201d\n\nDIPLOMACY AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n\nRe-establishment of Nigeria\u2019s position and influence in the regional and global arena.

I see this victory as a renewed call by God Almighty to rededicate myself to His service and that of the people of Edo state.\n\n\u201cFrom the statement by the Supreme Court Justices, it is clear that they align with what Edo people knew all along, which is that there was no merit in the case. The controversy was diabolical and ill-willed. It is reassuring that the Judiciary has upheld the wishes of the masses once again.\u201d\n\nObaseki dedicated the victory to Edo people, noting that their resolve to stand by him despite the campaign of calumny was inspiring.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for supporting him and holding steadfast in his belief and vision for a better Edo.\n\nThe governor also hailed His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), for ensuring that the judiciary remained impartial.\n\nRecall that the Federal High Court, Abuja, had on January 9 dismissed the alleged certificate forgery suit against Governor Obaseki.\n\nThe judge, Ahmed Mohammed, had described the APC\u2019s allegation as strange, saying it was like an outsider telling a man in his house that he is not the father of a child.\n\nApparently not satisfied with the decision of the lower court, the APC approached the appellate court to challenge the judgment.\n\nBut the Court of Appeal had in a judgement, on March 18, held that the case the APC brought to vacate the January 9 verdict of the Federal High Court in Abuja, which authenticated Obaseki\u2019s University of Ibadan degree certificate, lacked merit.\n\nThe appellate court panel which was led by Justice Stephen Adah, upheld the testimony of the Deputy Registrar, Legal, University of Ibadan, Abayomi Ajayi, who had earlier confirmed before the trial court, that Obaseki attended the University and fulfilled all the requirements for admission into the department of Classical Studies.\n\nDelivering judgment in the appeal, the judge held that the lower court was right in its findings and conclusions.\n\n...",

          "title": "Governor Oyetola and the Chinese fable, by Charles Adeyemi",
          "text": "Before the rinderpest, I came across a well-known fable from Chinese mythology about the virtues of willpower and perseverance as a regular adherent of the Confucian doctrine of social co-existence. Wikipedia would discover that the tale first appeared in Book 5 of the Liezi, a Daoist text of the 4th century BC, and was retold in the Garden of Stories by the Confucian scholar Liu Xiang in the 1st century BC. It was also used by Chairman Mao Tsetung, the first premier of the people\u2019s republic of China in his famous speech of 1945.\n\nThe myth concerns an Old Man of 90 years who lived near a pair of mountains in the Yu Province. He was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains and sought to dig through them with hoes and baskets. To move the mountain, he could only make one round trip between the mountain and his home in a year. When questioned as to the seemingly impossible nature of his task, the Old Man replied that while he may not finish this task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children, and their children, and so on through the many generations, some day the mountains would be removed if he persevered. The gods in Heaven, impressed with his determination, hard work and perseverance, ordered the mountains separated.\n\nDrawing the Nexus, it takes an unusual willpower ganished with brilliance and a total believe in the miracle working God to lead a state like osun in 2018. The last Administration has given their best but majority of Osun people and spectators of Governance of Osun doesn\u2019t see the state rising from the toga of issues it was confronted with prior to the Advent of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nFor instance, Osun was a state popular with all sort of complications ranging from reactions to different policies and initiatives of the system, from school merger, to single school uniform policy, to avoidable religious crisis, attempt at building of a cargo airport which many believe was a white elephant adventure. for a protracted period of time, workers were subjected to modulated salary option which was popularly reffered to \u2018Afusa\u2019, funny as it was then, the senior staff of government were collecting half salary, the brutal situation is not even the half salary but that all status quo deductions were implemented to the full from the supposed modulated salary. Bank deductions never stopped, gratuity payment for pensioners were also modulated, cooperative deductions were used by the system of that time leaving an average workers with empty pocket.\n\nOf course, the sad effect was conspicuous and felt in the entire state, it made the narrative popular that Osun is a civil service state. By the time the last Administration was winding down, it became obvious that a new approach must be explored, a new agenda must be sought for, yet premised on the continuity mantra. Ogbeni Aregbesola, the former Governor and current minister of interior accented to this when he publicly told osun people to expect a new approach and probably a reversal of some of his policies should they felt it\u2019s necessary, they can tell the party and the party will relate to Ilerioluwa. He admonished them to expect Ilerioluwa to do things differently. A prophecy that would come to pass sooner.\n\nTalking of willpower and determination, the alpha shock started when the current Governor started telling people of Osun that he will pay full salaries as and when due to the workers of osun.\n\nTruth be told, even top members of the party hierarchy both in the state and federal dispell this promise as a mere campaign contents to sway votes, what was clear to all then was that osun has bitten more than she can chew and future generations will continue to pay for it with obvious punishment such as \u201cAfusa\u201d and it\u2019s attendant hardship on the people of Osun. The second category of people that doubt this campaign promise by candidate Oyetola were the workers! Yes they are the worst hit by the \u2018Afusa\u2019 tsunami, imagine working for a month and collecting half of your normal salary with full deductible deductions.\n\nGovernor Oyetola has not only fulfill his promise of paying full salaries, he has went further to approve minimum wage for all levels of Osun workforce, isn\u2019t this a miracle? An illustration of dry bone rising again, yet infrastructural development hasn\u2019t stop for a single day!\n\nPeople begin to wonder how the man of the moment is doing it, questions like what\u2019s the secret? the magic and whatever is it should be shared for younger generation to learn. An economic expert, Dr Ogunyemi said it takes a miracle worker to do what Oyetola is doing. Is this hard to know?\n\nI find out it\u2019s about prudence in Public Financial Management (PFM), a process by which money comes into the purse of the government and the process by which goverment expend the money through implementation of project and services.This is the premise on which the financial encyclopedia based his fiscal governance on.\n\nOsun Government under the leadership of Governor Oyetola has been able to develop Medium Term Sector Strategy (MTSS) and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which has been assisting the state in preparing realistic budget since 2018.\n\nThe budget performance of the state government of osun is available on the state website (www.stateofosun.gov.ng). Both national and international partners in the area of public finance has credited osun as one of the states that has developed and signed into law virtually all financial management laws.\n\nWithin two years of his Adminstration, the payment system of internally generated revenue has been digitalized, this is in line with blocking all loopholes and thus remitted IGR skyrocketed in an ever increasing scale. To solidify this system, State of Osun Audit law of 2018, which provides the legal backup for the office of the Auditor General for the state and Auditor Generals for the local governments was signed into law and later within the same first two years, Osun Public Financial Management law 2020 was also accented.\n\nThe Administration has invested heavily on ICT via State integrated financial management information system (SIFIMIS) which assist the administration in Setting realistic budget. The Gboyega Oyetola Administration has put in place a robust procurement system and auditing institutions has also been repositioned.\n\nIn recognition of all this fiscal efforts, SFTAS (State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Project) rated Osun among the top in public financial management in Nigeria. This is a world bank funded project alongside federal government of Nigeria. At the end of their fact finding mission accross the country which includes but not limited to evaluation of Budget Preparation process, budget performance process, public procurement process, financial accounting process, auditing process and even revenue collection process. They declared osun one of the best in the entire country.\n\nAnother project that played a key role in osun fiscal governance is SLOGOR (State and Local Governance Reform Project). Under Governor Oyetola leadership, SLOGOR has repositioned the fiscal space in the State of osun and can compete with comity of performing States, it has been adjudged by the World Bank Assisted State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Project as one of the best in Nigeria. The project has open the State Of Osun to budget support from international development community.\n\nGovernor Oyetola has repositioned the fiscal governance of osun than before. Within the armbit of international development organizations like WORLD BANK, UNESCO, European Union (EU), United Kingdom Department for International Development ( DFID) and others, they are now seeing osun as a state they can partner with. They are more willing than before to support the government. These are development partners that can\u2019t inject their money into a system that\u2019s not transparent.\n\nAll osun audit reports are on the osun website and this has raise the level of confidence of donors and development partners. It can only happened when you have a thourougbred professional and technocrats in power. There\u2019s more to be done and osun people are willing to give a man with Will power, determination, and perseverance in the thoughts that things can be better.\n\nOsun couldn\u2019t have Achieve so much with so little if not for financial mastery and prudence of the Governor. A Bantu proverb situates that \u201cWhen money realizes that it is in good hands, it wants to stay and multiply in those hands.\u201d this is the testimony of our grass to grace fiscal reality in osun, the reason why we must insist on retaining Governor Gboyega Oyetola to continue this frugal display of financial mastery, discipline and brilliant fiscal governance.\n\nForward With Governor Gboyega Oyetola forever!\n\nCharles Adeyemi writes from osogbo.

Until the appeal is decided, Rufai remains behind bars.\n\nHowever, federal attorneys stated in their appeal that Rufai\u2019s bail placement was a risky one, as the husband of Rufai\u2019s would-be guardian was convicted in 2014 of buying the stolen personal information of dozens of people and using it to commit fraud.\n\n\u201cWe do not think it\u2019s appropriate that someone who\u2019s been accused of wire fraud would be released into a home where \u2014 of the couple, the two people living there \u2014 the male part of the couple has already been convicted federally of wire fraud,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nShe explained that it is standard practice to keep someone released on bail away from former felons.\n\n\u201cGenerally, when someone is going to be released on bond, one of the conditions you often see is that they are not to associate with people who have criminal histories,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nThe appeal also noted that Rufai\u2019s named custodian was identified by her bank \u201cas a suspect in an email impersonation and money laundering scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Western District of Washington believes that he needs to come out here and face these charges in the district where they\u2019re filed,\u201d said Emily Langlie, communication director at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Washington.\n\nRufai\u2019s travel documents were seized, and his movements, if he is released on bond, will be monitored with an ankle bracelet. He would also be forbidden from leaving the Eastern District of New York \u2014 or eventually, the Western District of Washington.\n\nHowever, federal attorneys stated in their appeal that Rufai\u2019s bail placement was a risky one, as the husband of Rufai\u2019s would-be guardian had been convicted in 2014 of buying the stolen personal information of dozens of people and using it to commit fraud.\n\nBesides the concern of guardianship, the appeal stated that Rufai is an extreme flight risk for several reasons.\n\nFor one, Rufai was already attempting to go back to Nigeria, and presumably would have done so had he not been detained; he was arrested at New York City\u2019s JFK International Airport on May 14 while attempting to board a flight back to Nigeria, by way of Amsterdam.\n\nThe appeal noted that Rufai has no clear ties to the Western District of Washington, and has just one family member living in the United States.\n\nIn contrast, Rufai\u2019s wife and children live in Nigeria, and he holds an appointed government position as senior special assistant to the governor of a Nigerian state. While he has been suspended from that position following his arrest, he has not been fired.\n\nAdditionally, Rufai allegedly has a history of forging identification documents, and prosecutors worry he could easily obtain a false passport. They noted that at the time of his arrest he held a first-class plane ticket and several other items of luxury, suggesting that he has the financial means of getting away.\n\n\u201cRufai is experienced in obtaining and trafficking in stolen identities and identification documents. He has the skills and resources to produce fraudulent documents that would allow him to leave the country,\u201d the attorneys wrote, adding, \u201cLocation monitoring will not guarantee Rufai\u2019s appearance. A defendant determined to flee can simply remove his location monitoring device and disappear.\u201d\n\nProsecutors believe that Rufai would be gone for good if he did get back to Nigeria, noting that it is hard enough to extradite ordinary Nigerian citizens, much less high-power government members.\n\n\u201cExtradition would be difficult \u2014 in part because he is a government official there,\u201d Langlie told KIRO Radio last week.\n\nIf prosecutors get their way, Rufai will be transported to Seattle \u2014 though he could still be let out on bail once in Washington.\n\n\u201cRather than have him released in New York, it\u2019s our preference that the U.S. Marshals Service transport him to the Western District of Washington, and then he can have another bail release hearing here,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nShe did not have a timeline on when that could happen, noting that, for security reasons, they don\u2019t tend to find out ahead of time when a person is being transported by the Marshals.\n\nWhatever the judge decides on the appeal, that decision could further be appealed by either side before it is considered final.",

          "text": "The wait is almost over as Manchester City and Chelsea get ready to battle it out for Europe\u2019s most prestigious prize.\n\nCity overcame Paris Saint-Germain to book their place in their first ever Champions League final while Chelsea saw off Real Madrid in the search for their second crown in Europe\u2019s elite competition.\n\nA fascinating contest between the two English giants awaits us, and with plenty of talent on display it should be a thrilling fight to the death.\n\nBut while Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden, Riyad Mahrez and Co will be hoping to outshine their attacking counterparts at Chelsea \u2013 like Mason Mount, Kai Havertz and Christian Pulisic \u2013 it\u2019s in defence where the European final could be won or lost.\n\nMost of the talk is about both sides\u2019 star-studded attacks heading into Saturday\u2019s showdown but if it wasn\u2019t for their respective backlines, perhaps City and Chelsea would not have secured their passage to the biggest fixture in club football.\n\nCity\u2019s defence, most notably due to the heroics of Ruben Dias and John Stones, kept out PSG\u2019s fearsome threat of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Co while Chelsea stayed impressively resolute against Madrid at the semi-final stage.\n\nBut this has been the norm in this season\u2019s Champions League, and both sides can point to having the joint-meanest defences in Europe right now.\n\nBoth English giants have conceded just four times in the competition this term in 12 matches, two fewer than any other side despite having played more games.\n\nPremier League rivals Liverpool have the third-best defensive record in the Champions League, conceding six times in 10 games while Ajax and Juventus have shipped seven and eight goals respectively.\n\nAnd in these 12 matches for City and Chelsea, they have kept a remarkable eight clean sheets each compared to Liverpool\u2019s seven.\n\nThere has been absolutely no let up at the back, with opponents denied even a sniff at goal in the Champions League. Neither team has made a defensive error that has led to a goal.\n\nFurthermore, City and Chelsea both possess a commanding presence in defensive set-piece situations, with Pep Guardiola\u2019s side only conceding once compared to Chelsea\u2019s two.\n\nYes, City and Chelsea tend to dominate the ball when playing but the respective defences are more than doing their job when called upon in their quest for Champions League glory.\n\nIn fact, both sides\u2019 impressive form in defence goes deeper than just the Champions League.\n\nAfter a sloppy start to the season, City have been formidable at the back stretching back to December when they turned their fortunes around to storm to the Premier League title.\n\nAnd they have Dias and his unlikely partner Stones to largely thank for that.\n\nStones\u2019 City career looked dead and buried due to a mixture of injuries and poor form, but he has enjoyed an incredible renaissance to put City on the verge of history.\n\nThe Etihad outfit have kept a remarkable 32 clean sheets in just 60 matches this season, conceding only 41 times. And errors have led to goals only on four occasions.\n\nCity have been putting bodies on the line, and that was evident in the second leg against PSG as Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men kept coming forward in desperate search of a goal only for Dias and Stones to block everything that came their way.\n\nDias, who was crowned FWA Footballer of the Year last week after taking England by storm, has proved the perfect partner for Stones in the heart of defence.\n\nMeanwhile for Chelsea, their fortunes \u2013 especially in defence \u2013 have been transformed since Thomas Tuchel took over at Stamford Bridge at the end of January after club legend Frank Lampard was dismissed.\n\nAnd the Blues have enjoyed similar success to Saturday\u2019s opponents in all competitions this term, helped massively by Tuchel\u2019s appointment.\n\nChelsea have kept 31 clean sheets in 58 fixtures, conceding just 43 goals in that time \u2013 two more than City.\n\nThe Blues however have conceded double as many goals from errors this season (eight) compared to Guardiola\u2019s side.\n\nBut when you consider how shaky the Blues were under Lampard prior to his dismissal, Tuchel deserves huge plaudits for keeping his side tight at the back when under immense pressure.\n\nAnd one man in particular has benefitted from Tuchel\u2019s appointment at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThat man is Antonio Rudiger, whose Stamford Bridge career seemed all-but over during Lampard\u2019s final days in charge of Chelsea after the German defender was deemed surplus to requirements.\n\nBut under Tuchel he has enjoyed a brilliant revival, and is now in line for a new contract in west London after establishing a very solid partnership with veteran centre back Thiago Silva.\n\nIn 24 matches that he has played under his compatriot, Rudiger has helped keep 14 clean sheets, and Chelsea have only let in 10 goals in that period.\n\nRudiger has proved better in most departments since Tuchel took charge, producing 1.4 tackles per game compared to just 0.7 when playing under Lampard.\n\nThe 28-year-old\u2019s stats are also up on the interception front, making 0.8 per match now compared to 0.6 under Lampard. And he is also making 1.6 recoveries more each game under his German manager.\n\nWith his future previously uncertain, there would be no better time for Rudiger to prove he is ready for a new deal than against City in Porto.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",
          "summary": "The wait is almost over as Manchester City and Chelsea get ready to battle it out for Europe\u2019s most prestigious prize.\nBut this has been the norm in this season\u2019s Champions League, and both sides can point to having the joint-meanest defences in Europe right now.\nAnd in these 12 matches for City and Chelsea, they have kept a remarkable eight clean sheets each compared to Liverpool\u2019s seven.\nThere has been absolutely no let up at the back, with opponents denied even a sniff at goal in the Champions League.\nStones\u2019 City career looked dead and buried due to a mixture of injuries and poor form, but he has enjoyed an incredible renaissance to put City on the verge of history.",

Quite a large number of Nigerian children have fallen victims of illicit commercial activities which include human trafficking, sexual exploitation domestic servitude, and street begging.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our children from kidnappers, abusive parents and guardians as well as the sale of our children for exploitative purposes further re-enforces the need to strengthen the resolve to accelerate action on policies and programs including a legal framework that will help in enhancing the protection of our children from these evil elements and criminal minds.\n\n\u201cThis framework includes the need for the passage and full implementation of the Child\u2019s Right Acts, and the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act in all States that have neither passed nor implemented these laws as these laws have been designed to provide a safe-net for our children.\n\n\u201cThere is a great need to begin instilling in our children the core values of honesty, hard work, selfless service, moral rectitude, patriotism, respect for elders, accountability, discipline and self-confidence. We as leaders must set a good example for the children.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that if our children grow with these core values instilled in them, the hope of having a truly great Nation in the near future will be rekindled.\n\n\u201cTo parents, teachers, guardians and religious leaders, I implore you all on this day to take into cognisance the need to protect our children and wards from unscrupulous elements that see our children as mere commodities and toys to be toiled with and exploited.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative that parents work closely with NAPTIP and other law Enforcement Agencies in ensuring that perpetrators of evil acts towards our children are reported in order to ensure that such perpetrators are brought to book.\n\n\u201cNAPTIP on its part shall continue to work assiduously towards the protection of our children,\u201d she said.",

This has only increased during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cToday of all days, we must commit to reinforce the protection mechanisms for all children.\n\n\u201cBut we have learned from this pandemic too. One thing we have learned is that education takes place not only in schools \u2013 children can and should learn both in and out of school. A learning continuum is critical, so that all children continue to get an education irrespective of their situation, location, or the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNigerian children are resilient, talented and aspire to do great things. And it is our responsibility to give them the platform and encouragement to do just that.\n\n\u201cWe know that protecting children and investing in women and families is not only the right thing to do it has proven to be a sound economic choice and a cost-effective tool for national development.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate our children today, we must act in their best interests and deploy innovative solutions to fast-track learning and health services to build back better, for every Nigerian child.\u201d",

          "text": "Mali\u2019s constitutional court has named the colonel who led a military coup this week as the country\u2019s new interim leader.\n\nThe ruling, issued late on Friday, said Assimi Goita would \u201clead the transition process to its conclusion\u201d and carry the title of \u201cpresident of the transition, head of state\u201d.\n\nThe court said it had made the decision due to the \u201cvacancy in the presidency\u201d following the resignation of caretaker President Bah Ndaw.\n\nGoita, 38, was previously Ndaw\u2019s deputy, and had ordered the former leader\u2019s arrest on Monday following a cabinet reshuffle that stripped two soldiers of their ministerial posts.\n\nNdaw resigned while in detention on Wednesday and was later released.\n\nFriday\u2019s ruling raised the stakes as West African leaders prepared to meet on Sunday to decide how they would respond to the takeover, which regional and Western governments fear could could exacerbate instability in northern and central Mali and undermine a regional fight against armed groups linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS).\n\nGoita\u2019s power grab is his second in less than a year.\n\nLast August, the young colonel led a coup that deposed Mali\u2019s elected President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita amid protests against perceived corruption and the government\u2019s failure to quell armed groups.\n\nBut faced with the threat of regional sanctions, Goita and other coup leaders agreed to hand over power to a transitional government that would steer the country back to civilian rule.\n\nThe colonel was then appointed vice president of the interim government and his fellow soldiers were given key cabinet posts.\n\nAt the time, mediators from the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) insisted that Mali\u2019s transition, which is due to end with elections in February, remain civilian-led. The bloc stipulated in a joint declaration that the vice president of the transition \u201ccannot under any circumstances replace the president\u201d.\n\nECOWAS heads of state are due to meet in Ghana on Sunday.\n\nNdaw\u2019s detention on Monday lifted any illusions of a civilian-led transition, said Haque, while the constitutional court\u2019s ruling made clear that \u201cthe real strongman of Mali is Assimi Goita\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the run-up to this announcement, Goita has been meeting religious leaders, union leaders, the opposition in a bid to rally them to his cause,\u201d said Haque. \u201cSo this court ruling does not come as a surprise.\u201d\n\nGoita, however, still has to deal with the looming threat of regional sanctions, the correspondent added.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the colonel made his first public remarks since his latest power grab and said the military had had little choice but to intervene.\n\n\u201cWe had to choose between disorder and cohesion within the defence and security forces and we chose cohesion,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that he would name a new prime minister from among the members of the M5-RFP coalition, which led protests against Keita last year and fell out with Ndaw and Ouane during the transition.\n\nJeamille Bitar, a member of the coalition, said its pick for the post would be Choguel Maiga, a former government minister.",
