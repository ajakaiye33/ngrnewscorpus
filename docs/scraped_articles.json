          "text": "Gbenga Adeniji\n\nNobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, on Thursday said he was prevented from boarding at the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, for failing to obtain what the airline staff described as a \u2018permit to travel\u2019 to Nigeria.\n\nSoyinka spoke in Lagos on the theme, \u2018COVID, technology and citizen banishment,\u2019 during an interaction with journalists.\n\nThe essayist said although no attempt was made to banish him, he nevertheless felt like serving a decree of banishment for 48 hours that the event lasted.\n\nEvery inbound traveller is expected to upload their COVID result on a portal created by the Federal Government, with the traveller\u2019s details including passport, ticket numbers. At the end of the exercise, a barcode is generated, indicating a permit to travel.\n\nThe playwright who lamented his experience said, \u201cOf course, there is something known as force majeure that means you cannot help it. If there are floods, or there is turbulence and your plane cannot land and it is turned somewhere else, yes we understand that.\u201d\n\nHe added that when an individual \u201cis prevented from entering his own country through the lapses of others, then there is problem.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman, who recounted two experiences, stated, \u201cI had my vaccination, I have taken the 72 hours COVID test and I was negative. But apparently, there was one more, a new one called PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), which the Nigerian government had begun to insist upon. I was away from the country at the time. I didn\u2019t know this. I thought I was all geared up. I couldn\u2019t get on that plane. I had to go back to Paris. I spent three extra days in Paris before I could get back to the airport, after taking the test and getting my result.\n\n\u201cBut it happened the second time, just about a week ago. This time, I had my PCR, and I still remained vaccinated. And of course, it did not happen to me alone; there were other Nigerians who passed the night at the airport. They couldn\u2019t leave the airport because they had already passed through immigration. But at the gate, they were also turned back.\n\n\u201cThis time, it was not PCR, or whatever it is called. It was that they had not gone to something called the Nigerian Travel Porter and obtained a permit to travel. Again, it was my turn. I said I have got everything, that I have the PCR. But they said no, that there was one more item that the Nigerian government now requires. So, I had to go back into Paris.\n\n\u201cThen I was directed where to go through a machine, and pay the necessary amount and then permission will be generated from Nigeria so that I could travel back to my own country. I rebooked, and the following morning, I was back at Air France. At the hotel, we tried to get on this porter, but we could not.\u201d\n\nHe added that by 10 am, he realised that he might miss his flight again, so he told Air France about his challenge.\n\nSoyinka said, \u201cTogether with Air France staff, between 10 am and 2 pm, we kept working. They brought their computers, some changed my password for me so that they could then try through their own but they could not. We succeeded maybe around 12 something in the receipt of the payment of my credit card being acknowledged.\n\n\u201cBut it did not generate the permit to enter Nigeria, which has a square barcode. The process itself is really remarkable. I don\u2019t believe that it was the Ministry of Health who created that questionnaire. I think it must be the Ministry of Internal Affairs. I invite you all to attempt to get on that portal and tell me what it has to do with COVID after the first couple of questions. What the majority of those questions have to do with COVID-19 I understand.\n\n\u201cI asked them if there are other flights going to West African countries, which do not require this kind of secret service questionnaire, because that was what I consider it to be. And they said there was a flight leaving for Lome at 4.30 pm. I told them to put me on it. Boarding began at about 2.40 pm; I carried my bags ready to go to Lome.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, one of the supervisors had come from the office. She was working with the phones like mad; suddenly, she broke into a sigh of relief and came running to where I was with my bags. She told me that she has good news for me, that I have been given special permission to enter my country. I don\u2019t believe that I or any Nigerian should require special permission to enter his or her own country.\u201d\n\nSoyinka added that he didn\u2019t believe that other nationals were obstructed from entering their countries the way Nigeria did for its citizens.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is a plea to the Ministry of Health, Internal Affairs, which I am convinced must have participated in this form, to find out what is going on and why one should be subjected to this ordeal. Let us go out through the front door and come back through the front door as it is befitting to all normal citizens.\n\n\u201cStop treating Nigerians like criminals and illegal immigrants who end up sleeping on couches or on the floor of the airport.\u2019\u2019\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

The informal economy is badly hit.\n\n\u201cThis is where you have people with no tenured appointment or jobs; the partially employed, the working poor.\n\n\u201dThe job losses are huge in this sector. We are therefore committing more efforts to lift millions in this bracket out of poverty. More programmes will be introduced in the near future,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister commended the Central Bank of Nigeria for its interventions in the government economic recovery plans, noting particularly the recent one-year moratorium given on interests to entrepreneurs.\n\nHe added that \u201din Nigeria, our Central Bank has been alleviating the pains of workers in the private sector, even employers \u2013 the industrialists who, for instance, have been given one-year moratorium on interest on funds sourced through the CBN.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on these programmes because we know full well that the consequences of negative turns in the informal economy are at the base of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201dTo this extent, there is no zone in Nigeria that is not affected by one insecurity problem or the other.\n\n\u201cSo, the theme of the workshop by OTUWA, which was on COVID-19 and the economy of the West Africa sub-region, could not have come at a better time.\n\n\u201dIt is a very useful step towards economic recovery and I do hope you make the conclusions from the workshop available to governments in Africa, especially our West Africa in particular, for integration into recovery plans,\u201d he said.",

What about some of our high ranking chieftains who defected to the APC in 2014 and who worked hard to ensure that the PDP lost the 2015 presidential elections.\n\n\u201cSome of these leaders are occupying prominent elective positions in government on the platform of the PDP today with some of them aspiring to get the party\u2019s presidential ticket for the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cTo some of us, this is double standard which may not help the party in the long run,\u201d a member of the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) told our correspondent on Friday night.\n\nThe meeting was also expected to take a final position on the Deputy National Chairman (North), which is being contested for by Alhaji Umar Damagum and Mrs. Inna Ciroma.\n\nThe party was yet to take a final position on who to consider for the position between the two contestants from Yobe State.\n\nAnswering a question on the party\u2019s position on the matter, the chairman of the Convention Organising Committee, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State said during a briefing earlier on Friday that matter was still being resolved.\n\nFintiri had said: \u201cWe are still deliberating on who to go for the office between the two contestants but we have resolved that the two will not contest at the convention. One of them must step down for the other\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, last minute preparations for the convention continued in earnest up to Friday judgement.\n\nThere was a flurry of activities at the expansive Eagle Square, Abuja, designated venue for the convention as party members and hired hands were observed performing one task or the other.\n\nTents have been erected and the main podium has been put in place, brightly decorated in the red, green, white signature colours of the PDP.\n\nAlso, posters of contestants in varying sizes adorned strategic locations at the venue.\n\nThe various committees and subcommittees set up by the party for the purpose of the convention were working round the clock to ensure meeting deadlines.\n\nThe meeting was still in progress as of the time of filing this report.",

And it becomes a personal as to title of the occupier of the office, either by election or appointment and it depends on who the constitution has decided.\n\n\u201cIn my view, by this analysis, I cannot see any legal right or interest which the suspension of the order of injunction granted by the lower court will protect by this application.\u201d\n\nThe court affirmed that the suspension of the appellant at the ward level which was also upheld at the local and state levels made it impossible for Secondus to function as National Chairman of PDP.\n\nThe court continued: \u201cThe appellant having been suspended as a member of the sixth respondent, can no longer partake in the affairs of the sixth respondent in any capacity. So, the injunction orders made by the lower court were intended to protect the confirmation of the suspension of the appellant.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to journalists outside the courtroom immediately after the ruling, counsel for Secondus, Tayo Oyetibo (a Senior Advocate of Nigeria), said they would return to continue with the substantive appeal.\n\n\u201cSo the court has directed that the PDP can continue with the national convention. However, the instruction is that the appeal continues and depending on the outcome of the appeal, if it succeeds, then, it has the impact on whatever decision that is taken on the national convention. So, it\u2019s still not over.\u201d\n\nAlso, speaking to journalists on behalf of first to eleventh respondents counsels, counsel representing the Ist to 5th respondent, Henry Bello, described the ruling as well deserved, which he said, has given the PDP go ahead order to conduct the national convention.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

If there was any such operation as claimed by the media, it was not carried out by the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe commission enjoins the public to discountenance the report\u201d, the statement signed by Spokesman of the commission, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, said.\n\nIn September, Odili sued the Nigeria Immigration Service for seizing his passport at the airport. The immigration service however said it acted on EFCC\u2019s request as part of a probe of the former governor. Justice Inyang Ekwo, however, ordered NIS to release the passport to Odili.\n\nA High Court had in 2007 barred the antigraft commission from investigating or prosecuting Odili.\n\nAlso in 2020, the former governor approached a Federal High Court for another injunction to stop an impending probe.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "2023: Buhari Reveals There Is Third Term Agenda As Earlier Exposed In SaharaReporters\u2019 Story",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday confirmed an earlier expose by SaharaReporters that the Presidency cabal was plotting a Third Term agenda despite his maladministration and repressive eight-year regime.\n\nBuhari had stated this at a meeting in Makkah with some Nigerians living in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where he just ended a visit that he would serve his tenure and leave when his time was up, in a subtle confirmation of what the cabal was planning as earlier exposed by SaharaReporters.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\n\nBuhari said, \u201cI swore by the Holy Qur\u2019an that I will serve in accordance with the constitution and leave when my time is up. No 'Tazarce\u2019 (tenure extension). I don\u2019t want anybody to start talking about and campaigning for an unconstitutional extension. I will not accept that.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued by Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Buhari warned anyone canvassing for a tenure extension for him.\n\nThe statement further said President Buhari also tacitly expressed support for efforts to increase the role of technology in the nation\u2019s elections, arguing that the introduction of the card reader and electronic register was God\u2019s answer to his prayers, having been cheated of his victory in three previous elections.\n\n\u201cAfter the third so-called defeat, I said, \u2018God Dey\u2019. My opponents laughed at me but God answered my prayers by bringing in technology. At that point, nobody can steal their votes or buy them.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari, who ended his visit to the Kingdom with the Friday Prayers at the Grand Mosque in Makkah said he would continue to abide by the constitution in all its ramifications and he will at all times supervise and deal with his ministers on the same basis.\n\nSee Also Politics EXCLUSIVE: Attorney-General Malami, Others Sacrifice Presidential Ambitions For Buhari's 3rd Term Agenda As President Plans To Visit Scotland, France, Others\n\nHe gave assurances at the meeting that in the balance of \u201ceighteen months or so of my time left, whatever I can do to improve the life of Nigerians, I will do it for the country.\u201d\n\nThe President commended Nigerians in Saudi Arabia for representing the country well and projecting its good image.\n\nHe also asked citizens to be fair to his administration at all times, asking critics to compare the security situations in the North-East and South-South in 2015 and the current situation.\n\n\u201cMy problem is the North-West where people are killing and stealing from one another. I had to be very hard on them and I will continue to be very hard until we put them in line and bring back order,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters on October 7 revealed that some members of the Aso Rock cabal were pushing a third-term agenda for Buhari and for the amendment of the Nigerian Constitution to allow the President to stay beyond 2023.\n\nSection 137 (1)(b) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), provides that \u201ca person shall not be qualified for election to the office of President if he has been elected to such office at any two previous elections\u201d.\n\nA similar move was made about 14 years for former President Olusegun Obasanjo, which failed.\n\nThe so-called Third Term Agenda collapsed on May 16, 2006, when the Nigerian Senate threw out the Constitutional Amendments Bill. Obasanjo left office a year later on May 29, 2007.\n\nSources in the Presidency had told SaharaReporters that members of the Aso Rock cabal were in on it and that some of them who had presidential ambitions ahead of the 2023 elections had been told to step down.\n\nOne of them was the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who had been eyeing the Presidency, as SaharaReporters had earlier reported.\n\nThe cabal, comprising some members of the President\u2019s extended family, friends, and some northern governors and leaders were described as the powers behind the throne.\n\nThe recent clamour by Northern elites had also been linked to the third-term agenda, with strong northern voices stressing that the region could retain the Presidency following Buhari's departure from office.\n\n\u201cRecently, members of the cabal with interest in Presidency were told to step down. Malami is now back as Kebbi State APC (All Progressives Congress) Governorship candidate after initially telling people he could run for President,\u201d one of the sources had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cAlso, the recent strong clamour for the presidency to remain in the Northern part of the country is as a result of this. Guess who they want to use to push the agenda?

A search warrant must have the name of the person that you want to carry out a search on his or her house,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlso, if they were looking for Imo street, they should look for Imo street elsewhere. There is an Imo close nearby. There is another Imo close somewhere in Garki, but this place is number 7, Imo river street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor that reason alone, they missed the point badly.\n\n\u201cIf one wants to give them the benefit of doubt, one can say it was a genuine mistake which was why they quietly withdrew, contrary to the information circulating that justice Odili resisted search.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, it might be politically motivated to embarrass the justice of the supreme court and to embarrass her husband.\u201d\n\nThe supreme court justice is the wife of Peter Odili, former governor of Rivers, who is currently on the watchlist of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Beyond investing in African startups, Kepple Africa Ventures is creating new industries",
          "text": "For Satoshi Shinada, taking bets and investing is not something he just started doing.\n\nAt the age of 18, he took his first bet to invest in himself by leaving Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s bold! Why did he do this?\u201d I had the same thought too, so I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to expose myself to a different environment and culture. I also loved reading stories of adventures which exposed me to stories about Africa,\u201d he told me over a Zoom call.\n\nHow was he able to afford the trip? He had just won a pact he made with his grandma. The deal was if he got admitted to the best university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, she\u2019d give him an allowance. It turned out to be an allowance of $10,000.\n\nIn hindsight, Shinada believes he used the money for a better endeavour: instead of buying items, he bought experience. His experience crisscrossing Africa taught him that, even among diverse cultures, trading is a common language.\n\nBefore making the trip around Africa, he was conflicted on whether to become a researcher or a businessman. At the end of the trip, he had chosen to become a businessman.\n\nIn 2010, upon graduation from college, Shinada joined Sojitz, a Japanese company that led investment in infrastructure and energy projects in West Africa. At Sojitz, he was in charge of developing and investing in infrastructure and energy projects like the first desalination project in sub-Saharan Africa at a commercial scale. After seven years on the job, he itched to do something different.\n\nHe took some time off to return to Japan before heading to Harvard Business School for his MBA. Afterwards, he returned to Africa as a general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\n\u201cWhile at Sojitz, I had started becoming interested in Nigerian entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. I saw a lot of Africans who studied or lived in Europe and the US coming back to their home countries to start businesses that leveraged on new technologies. This was the opposite of the brain drain. I knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did Kepple Africa Ventures start?\n\nSatoshi Shinada: The origin of Kepple dates back to when Takahiro Kanzaki, a certified public accountant, left KPMG to provide accounting and back-office support for startups in Japan. After a few years, he saw that his startups turned out to be well-established companies and unicorns. So, he came up with the idea of creating Fundboard, a portfolio management software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nAs a result of that decision, today Kepple is at the centre of the startup community in Japan with this tool. This provided Kepple with access to a network of investors to raise $18 million for Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\nThere are three persons involved in Kepple Africa ventures. Takahiro Kanzaki is in charge of fundraising from Japanese investors. Ryosuke Yamawaki handles investing in East and Southern African startups while I focus on investing in West and North African startups. Yamawaki started investing in Kenyan startups in 2018 while I started doing the same in Nigeria the following year.\n\nDA: What\u2019s Kepple\u2019s investment thesis?\n\nSS: Kepple Africa Ventures came to bridge two gaps. The first was the deep gap between seed and Series A because investors are very fragmented. We wanted to become an anchor investor in the seed stage for startups in Africa.\n\nThe second was, we wanted to bridge the mismatch between what African startups needed and the type of investors available in the ecosystem. We wanted to solve this problem by bringing more Japanese companies to invest directly in African startups and providing strategic support/capital, and in the end becoming an acquirer of the startups.\n\nIn Africa, you usually find financial investors and impact-driven social investors from Europe or the US, but you don\u2019t find lots of strategic investors. These strategic investors are supported by the existing big businesses. They drive the growth of the startups through partnerships and end up even acquiring startups and giving exit opportunities to the ecosystems. You\u2019ll find more of these strategic investors in India or Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve already facilitated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to directly invest in our portfolio companies. In the past 10 months, we\u2019ve brought four or five Japanese companies to directly invest into our portfolio companies.\n\nDA: Hmm, that\u2019s good to hear. What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nSS: First, I\u2019d like to point out that our big vision is to create new industries from Africa. So we don\u2019t consider our investment standalone. We want to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nNow to answer your question, we lookout for the quality of the founders; they have to have a big vision to tackle real problems. Beyond having a big vision, they need to understand the biggest pain points of their customers. And why I say so is that in Africa it\u2019s easy to mix up individual pains and social pains. For instance, deciding to tackle the pain point of poverty in Africa, although an important issue, doesn\u2019t really help you to monetise your business model. Africa is also a place where it is very difficult to make people pay for your service.\n\nSo, your service or product should be really laser-focused on the biggest pain points of your customers and then you monetise that solution. We are not charity investors; we are commercial investors, so monetisation and revenue growth are very important.\n\nDA: Are there any sectors you prefer to invest in?\n\nSS: We\u2019re sector agnostic, but we filter the startups we invest in based on four investment pillars. The first pillar is startups helping to complement or supplement the lack of public infrastructure. For example, we invested in a company called Flare. They are building an ambulance network for Africa. You know in Africa it\u2019s difficult to access a reliable ambulance network, but by providing an Uber-like platform to the owners of ambulances and hospitals, they can create that kind of public service infrastructure of the ambulance network to make people\u2019s lives better and safer.\n\nThe second pillar is startups that help businesses to digitise their operations and production, and make them more efficient. In this case, I\u2019m talking about helping companies with a business-to-business (B2B) model, because in Africa, business-to-consumer (B2C) models are not as active as other markets in Southeast Asia or India.\n\nThe third pillar is focused on startups pioneering innovation where Africa does not have legacy infrastructure yet. Sometimes you can find leapfrogging technology from Africa and that technology could be applicable to other parts of the world. An example of this is one of our portfolio companies called Shyft Power in Nigeria. They automate the management of different power sources: grid of generators, solar power or batteries. They could commercialise this technology because in Nigeria many people don\u2019t rely solely on power from the grid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same in Japan. If we need to develop that technology in Japan, we have to create a very artificial environment where power is not stable enough. Interestingly, in Japan we are seeing more solar power sources being introduced in each home and now they need to get this power generated by solar to be combined with the power coming from the grid and sell to their communities.\n\nTo wrap this up, the fourth pillar is about startups that facilitate African content created by Africans for Africans. That\u2019s why we have invested in a company like Mdundo, which is seen as the African version of Spotify. We\u2019ve also invested in a company called Athlst, which publishes first-person narratives of African athletes from around the world.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada ( team member at Kepple Africa) and Lanre Aina, Co-Founder/CEO of ATHLST\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 100 startups within 3 years. That\u2019s unusual. Why?\n\nSS: Yes, it\u2019s intentional for a number of reasons. We didn\u2019t start out early in VC investing in Africa; we entered this market in 2018. But I think we came to the market at the right time. When we came in, the ecosystem had matured, so we thought it would make sense to bet on great startups quickly.\n\nOur swift approach is modelled after one of the most successful VCs in Southeast Asia, BeeNext. BeeNext makes most of its returns from follow-up investments. So their first cheque is to get their feet in so many startups so they become an insider and know what\u2019s going on in their portfolio companies. Once they see signs of exponential growth, they double down on their investment.\n\nAnother reason we invested in many startups was that we were new to the ecosystem, so we had to establish a reputation by increasing our presence so that we would access greater deal flow. Moving very fast and efficiently did that for us.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to challenge the perception that Japanese companies are slow. Japanese companies are notoriously known for their very slow decision-making process, compared to Indian or Chinese companies.\n\nDA: How have you been able to combine speed and quality while investing in startups?\n\nSS: That\u2019s a good question, It\u2019s always a balance between the quality and the speed. If you\u2019re investing in seed-stage startups, you don\u2019t have to do very detailed due diligence because one day the startup can decide to change its entire business model. This rarely happens in Series A. You just need to do more detailed due diligence on their product, tech, corporate governance and the founder.\n\nFor the seed-stage deals, it\u2019s more based on your conviction and trust in the founders. If you can build enough trust and conviction, with the minimum amount of due diligence, you should go ahead. And that\u2019s the strategy we took: we usually spend less than one month for due diligence when we invest in seed-stage deals. The quickest investment we\u2019ve made took two weeks, from the first introductory call to wiring the capital.\n\nDA: Tell me about some mistakes you\u2019ve made?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\nAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\n\nDA: Have you had any bad experiences with the startups? Has any startup in your portfolio gone bankrupt?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have any business that went bankrupt in my portfolio companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve had two companies that stopped operating, but it\u2019s not like the founders just disappeared. We understood how it happened and the founders were serious enough to explain to us what\u2019s going on. One of them even gave back 100% of the money that we invested. So, it wasn\u2019t a very bad situation.\n\nInitially, we thought we\u2019d have many cases of the stories you hear about startups going under or disappearing because our investment has been driven more by conviction and trust with our founders than anything else, but that\u2019s not happening yet. I think this is great validation.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada and the co-founders of Releaf\n\nDA: I see on your website it says you\u2019ve stopped accepting applications. What\u2019s happening?\n\nSS: Yes, that\u2019s true. Now we are in transition to our fund two. So we temporarily stopped accepting applications, but we still keep the form open and get about three to four applications per day. We think it\u2019s very important to keep our doors open to any new startups.\n\nInterestingly, about 85% of our investments was made into the startup that was introduced by one of our portfolio companies, or other co-investors. So the referral is the most important source of the deals. But if you just rely on that, you might miss someone coming from outside the network. So, we want to keep that door open for the outside.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your ticket size?\n\nSS: We are focused on seed-stage deals. Our first cheque is between $50K and150K. Once we invest, we look at the revenue growth in our portfolio companies, and if it shows very dramatic growth, we will do a follow-up investment, which could be somewhere between $200K to $1 million. Where we invest $1 million, it would be a syndicate between other Japanese investors.\n\nDA: Talking about Japanese investors, are there any other Japanese investors in Africa?\n\nSS: There are a few other Japanese VCs, but unfortunately, none of them have their cooperation in Africa. They just go back and forth between Japan and Africa; they\u2019re remote investors.\n\nCompared to them, we think of ourselves as very much committed to Africa because of our background of doing business in Africa. We\u2019ve noticed that a number of them just copy our investment deals. We don\u2019t like this and aren\u2019t comfortable with people just copying us while we\u2019re on the ground bearing the cost of making investments.\n\nDA: Hmm, so why are there not so many Japanese investors on the ground like Kepple?\n\nSS: Well, I think it\u2019s not as a result of the lack of capital or lack of willingness from the Japanese investors to invest in Africa; it\u2019s more about the shortage of capable and experienced talents who can manage the funds in Africa. It\u2019s very difficult to find talent who understand the African market and who can commit their lives to Africa.\n\nI\u2019m single, so it\u2019s very easy for me to move around, but my partner Ryosuke, who is based in Kenya, had to bring his wife and two kids along with him. He\u2019s really committed. His family has been around for a while such that his kids now speak Swahili.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nThe eNaira project will be implemented in phases. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nIn addition, the CBN plans to integrate the eNaira into its forex process via international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to enable Nigerians easily receive remittances.\n\nTransactions on the eNaira platform are free for the first 90 days from Monday, after which banks will revert to applicable charges as outlined in the CBN\u2019s guide.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Estonian on-demand transportation company, Bolt, plans to launch electric taxi services in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.\n\nBolt\u2019s plan comes on the heels of launching a \u201cgreen category,\u201d which allows riders to hail an electric or hybrid vehicle.\n\nHow would this be done? Per TechCrunch, Bolt plans to partner with banks in its African markets to assist its drivers in obtaining credit for buying electric vehicles and is exploring alternatives to its current scheme with leasing companies.\n\nThe company, which has operations in 45 countries \u2013 including seven in Africa \u2013 was launched in 2013 by Markus Villig, Bolt CEO.\n\nWhat does Bolt do? The company offers a variety of services such as ride-hailing, car, scooter, and bike rentals, food delivery, and, most recently, grocery delivery, branding itself as a transport and deliveries company.\n\nBesides, Bolt recently launched its food delivery service in Nigeria, and it has expanded its reach in South Africa to Johannesburg after moving to Cape Town in 2020.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. The company provides a green card option in Kenya and also operates e-bike food delivery.\n\nThe company also plans to introduce food delivery e-mobility options in other East African markets, including Uganda and Tanzania.\n\naYo to modify business model to fuel growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant on the Nokia \u2018Banana\u2019 8110 feature phone.

Also, the company says it currently has more than 15 million customers.\n\nMarius Botha, aYo Holdings CEO, said the company\u2019s vision is to become Africa\u2019s largest financial services technology platform by enabling the distribution of a diverse range of affordable and accessible microfinance products.\n\naYo and its shareholder, MTN, as of the time of writing, are currently finalising the details of a partnership with a new insurance group to gain access to more underwriter licenses and expand its product range and market penetration.\n\nAs part of this technological evolution, aYo has shifted to a cloud data warehousing approach, employing Snowflake as a solution to deal with growing volumes of customer data.\n\nBotha said, \u201cData is a key asset that we want to grow and leverage, as it will allow us to drive better outcomes and value for our customers.\u201d\n\naYo believes that experimenting with cutting-edge technologies will help them achieve their goal of providing disenfranchised Africans with access to financial services and bringing them into the economic mainstream.\n\nFacebook changes its name to Meta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Yesterday, Thursday, October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, announced at the company\u2019s Connect event that its new name will be Meta.\n\nWhy? Per The Verge, the rebranding is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift its focus away from being known solely as a social media company and toward Zuckerberg\u2019s plans for building the metaverse.\n\nIn a blog post, Zuckerberg said its corporate structure would not change, but it would affect how financials are reported.\n\nNamibian government to reduce crime through SIM card registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, the Namibian government announced that its plan to encourage citizens to register their identities when purchasing SIM cards is to aid the tracking down of criminals who use technology to commit crimes, among other things.\n\nIn March 2021, the government approved new regulations requiring all mobile phone subscribers to register their SIM cards before accessing network services.\n\nIs this common? Yes. 50 countries in Africa have introduced mandatory SIM card registration laws.\n\nBut Mbeuta Ua-Ndjarakana, Executive Director of the Information Ministry, has not set a date for the regulations to take effect.\n\nIn a statement, Ua-Ndjarakana stated that the request for information from stored SIM cards would be made following the regulations, including an order issued by a judge or magistrate authorising the obtaining of that information from service providers.\n\nUa-Ndjarakana said that the SIM card registration process would be done to protect consumers\u2019 privacy. He also mentioned that once the Communication Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) completes the consultation process and implementation modalities with operators, he will issue a start date for SIM card registration in the country.\n\nBut does SIM card registration reduce crime in Africa? Per The Citizen, information gathered from SIM cards during the registration process is unreliable in combating cybercrime.\n\nAccording to The Citizen, experts have warned of an increased risk of citizens being subjected to state surveillance due to this technology.\n\nHowever, according to Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, incidents of terror like banditry and kidnapping have significantly decreased in the country due to the implementation of a policy requiring citizens to obtain a National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nWhat\u2019s your take?

Well, on the one hand, her tech-enabled agribusiness recently raised a $3m Series A round to help accelerate global expansion. That\u2019s plenty validation. But then, it took her five years to build her first factory, and nine years in total to the Series A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams, founder and CEO, ReelFruit.\n\nBut how did someone who had dreams of becoming a medical doctor end up as an entrepreneur? And what would motivate them to leave their comfort zone, in a bid to singlehandedly start a sub-industry that never existed?\n\nThese and many more I sought to find out during a recent interview with Affiong Williams at the ReelFruit HQ in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this inspiring interview, Affiong Williams shares her motivations, inspirations, ambitions, entrepreneurial lessons, and tips on how to achieve a work-life balance while running a global company.\n\nWatch full interview or continue below for summarised text version\n\nThe full interview will go live on Tuesday November 2, 2021 at noon.

Source: Supplied,\n\nSouth African API fintech startup, Stitch has today announced its expansion into Nigeria and a $2M seed extension, with investment from Future Africa and Norrsken Foundation, among others.\n\nStitch announced an initial $4 million seed in February when it came out of stealth. This brings its total seed round to $6 million.\n\nThe startup launched officially in February 2021 with an API that provides software companies with identity verification tools and access to users\u2019 financial data.\n\nSince its launch, the company claims to have grown by 40-50% month-on-month.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s expansion to Nigeria, Kiaan Pillay, Stitch CEO, says, \u201cNigeria is one of the most active markets on the continent, if not the world, for fintech. The opportunity we see here is endless.\u201d\n\nHe says the company plans to become the \u201cgo-to partner for any businesses building financial products in Africa.\u201d\n\nMore competition: Stitch would be facing off with other API fintech players such as Mono which announced a $15 million Series A earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono, which launched in 2020, boasts partnerships with 270 businesses and 200 million financial data transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, this seed extension is to enable Stitch to grow its team in Nigeria as it prepares to expand into other African countries.\n\nCoup attempts in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s latest military coup occurred on Monday, October 25, 2021, in Sudan.\n\nThousands of Sudanese were met with bullets as they took to the streets to protest the dissolution of their democracy.\n\nPer Reuters, 7 people were killed by gunfire while 140 others were injured in clashes between soldiers and protesters.\n\nCoup \u2018pon coup: As a continent, Africa has experienced her share of challenges, deeply rooted in political tyranny and unaccountability, resulting in coups or dictatorships.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, Africa has witnessed 83 coup attempts since 1990, with 42 successful. Although rare today, coups still threaten democracy.\n\nRecoMed\u2019s $1.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nRecoMed, an online healthcare marketplace, has closed a $1.5 million financing round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round was led by Vunani Fintech Fund with participation from others including, Growth Grid Venture Capital Partners and Push Ventures.\n\nWhat does RecoMed do? Look at it as an Amazon for healthcare professionals.\n\nLaunched in 2013, it is a platform where patients can request healthcare professionals across South Africa by searching practitioner profiles while checking reviews.\n\nRecoMed says its platform reduces the time it takes for patients to get the medical services they need. The startup takes a cut per requests made on the website.\n\nIs healthtech the next fintech? While fintech startups still get a significant chunk of African funding, healthtech startups seem to be attracting some serious cash.\n\nAccording to Disrupt Africa, funding for healthtech startups increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHowever, Africa\u2019s healthcare sector still needs more funding to increase access to quality and affordable health services. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), $25-30 billion in new investment will be needed to meet Africa\u2019s healthcare demand over the next decade.\n\nRecoMed plans to integrate new products into its platform with the funding.\n\nUnion54 raises $3m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion54 Founders, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Credit: TechCrunch.\n\nZambian fintech startup, Union54 has raised $3 million in seed funding.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, The Y Combinator-backed startup saw investments from Tiger Global, ACE & Company, and Runa Capital.\n\nWhat does the startup do? Union54 owns an API that helps software companies issue debit cards without a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe startup was launched by a couple, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, this year. It is an offshoot of their previous company, Zazu, which launched in 2015 as a neobank in Zambia.\n\nThe duo launched Union54 after they encountered difficulty in issuing debit cards at Zazu. The cards had to be issued through partner banks, a process that took a lot of time.\n\nMlambo told TechCrunch that they \u201crealised that either the processor or the bank was not necessarily well equipped to be able to answer our questions or to be able to give us the product that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be channelled at building a strong engineering and product and sales team.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nNigeria\u2019s March to the Gallows.

The union do deal on individual but on general decision and welfare of all member. Whether you own a mega bakery, average bakery, smaller bakery; you are doing one bag or thirty bags in a day it doesn\u2019t really matter as long as you are producing bread, and it\u2019s the responsibility of the union to take every member along\u201d, Ayemere told our correspondent in a chat on Friday\n\nAccording to a statement by the association, the strike was due to increment in the price of baking materials, hence members agreed to shut down production since 23rd October.\n\nThe added, upon expiration of the One-week strike on Friday 29th October 2021, the price of bread will increase to meet current market realities of price of flours and sugar which are essentials in bread production.\n\n\u201cDue to the continuous massive increment in the price of baking materials and other things like diesel, gas, firewood etc.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved that for us to keep producing wholesome bread that is up to NAFDAC standard there must be upward review of prices\u201d, excerpt of the statement read.\n\n...",

Greg Ogbeifun; renowned lawyer, Sir Oladipo Okpeseyi SAN and the General Superintendent of Gospel Light International Ministries (New Covenant Gospel Church), Rev. Dr. Felix Ilaweagbon Omobude.\n\nSome guests at the convocation ceremony include Commissioner for Education, Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe; Esama of Benin Kingdom, Chief Sir Dr. Gabriel Igbinedion; former governor of Edo State, Chief Lucky Igbinedion, and former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin (UNIBEN), Prof. Osayuki Oshodin, amongst others.\n\nThe governor, who was represented by his deputy, Rt. Hon. Comr. Philip Shaibu, listed some of the areas to be explored to include endowments, grants, consultancy services, and commercial ventures, among others, adding, \u201cInstitutions should also promote and encourage inter-institutional co-operation and international linkages in sourcing for funds.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe state government is of the firm position that the primary mandate of our tertiary institution shall be teaching, research and community service. It is also of the view that their programmes shall be relevant to meet the needs of the State and engender development.\u201d\n\nObaseki restated that his administration remains committed to upgrading facilities in tertiary institutions in the state, noting that the government undertook fundamental reforms in the education sector in order to produce the required human capital for the economic development of the State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe state government will ensure accreditation of all courses by relevant statutory bodies. Our tertiary institutions must promote and encourage scholarship, entrepreneurship and produce skilled manpower relevant to the needs of the labour market.\n\n\u201cThese goals, they shall pursue through quality student intake; quality teaching and learning; research and development; staff welfare and development programmes; high standards in the quality of facilities, services and resources, and provision of a more practical based and technology-driven curriculum relevant to the needs of the labour market.\u201d\n\nObaseki said his administration took bold steps and hard decisions to achieve its objective of turning the institution into a world-class polytechnic.\n\nThe governor noted, \u201cThe process of remodelling this institution by the state government commenced with the setting up of a panel to examine, amongst other things, the operations of the school since inception and make recommendations that will refocus and redirect it on the path to greatness, by realizing its primary mandate as a technology-based institution.\n\n\u201cThereafter, government issued a white paper to give effect to the recommendations of the panel. This was the turning point in the life of the institution.\u201d\n\nThe governor celebrated the first lady for her award in recognition of her role in putting an end to gender-based violence, discrimination and subjugation of women and girls.\n\nOn her part, Betsy Obaseki noted that with the current educational development in Edo, the state will soon become the hub of technical manpower for, not only the state, but Nigeria at large.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWhat is happening here today is not a mistake and if we continue in this way, our institution will produce great technical manpower to service industries across Nigeria. The country needs Edo State for its development.\u201d\n\nIn his convocation speech, the rector of the polytechnic, Prof. Abiodun Falodun commended the governor for his commitment, focus and determination in repositioning the institution.\n\n...",

Okezie Ikpeazu, Nyesom Wike and Seyi Makinde had told the press after their meeting with Mimiko that they are in Ondo to invite Mimiko and his teeming supporters in the ZLP to the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe stakeholders meeting was called to discuss the meeting with the PDP governors and intimate members with the outcomes of series of interactions with PDP leaders on the invitation extended to him.\n\n\u201cMimiko told the stakeholders that the ZLP in being invited to join the PDP to rescue the country from the brink of insecurity.\n\n\u201cStakeholders appraised developments across the nation and agreed that the PDP is the most viable platform to work with to be able to work towards winning future elections in the State and in the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cMimiko had earlier told members that leaders of the PDP have shown demonstrable commitment to fully integrate all willing joiners from the ZLP and accord them full membership rights in what promises to be a win for PDP members and Nigerians alike.\n\n\u201cAfter detailed deliberations by leaders across Local Government Areas, Hon Akinlaja, the State Chairman, asked that a motion moved for members of the ZLP in Ondo State to join the PDP be put to vote to which all present voted yes by popular acclamation.\n\nEarlier, after about an hour closed door meeting with Mimiko, governor Tambuwal said \u201cwe are here in the beautiful of Ondo Town, in Ondo state the home of our leader, and brother, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, former governor of Ondo state to re-invite him back to his family, his political family, PDP and work towards rescuing Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am here with the governor of Abia, Rivers and Oyo. We had a very robust engagement with mimiko and very optimistic to hear something very positive from him soonest.\n\n\u201cThe message is simple, let\u2019s come back to reposition the PDP and rescue the country. The urgency of the matter is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are rebuilding the political platform, the PDP, we are repositioning it towards ensuring that PDP is back to power in 2023\u201d.\n\nAlso addressing newsmen, Dr Mimiko said that the visit by the PDP governors \u201d is one of the many engagements to woo him back to the party.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the series of interactions we have had over the last few months. They have come to tell us why we should join forces with them in the PDP and the efforts they are making in repositioning the party.\u201d\n\nMimiko promised to make known his position on the visit of the PDP governors after meeting leaders of the Zenith Labour Party yesterday evening.\n\nAccording to him \u201cWe have listened to them and going to have our stakeholders meeting and ultimately it\u2019s the people, the stakeholders that will decide.

          "title": "Facebook rebrands, names itself Meta to emphasize \u2018metaverse\u2019 vision NEW",
          "text": "Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said his company is rebranding itself as Meta.\n\nThe move comes as an effort to encompass its virtual-reality vision for the future.\n\nExperts point out that it also appears to be an attempt to change the subject from the Facebook Papers, a document trove that has revealed the ways Facebook ignored internal reports and warnings of the harms its social network created or magnified across the world.\n\nIn letter to Facebook public on Thursday, Zuckerberg described the move as the beginning of the next chapter for the internet, and the next chapter for the company.\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express ourselves more naturally. When I started Facebook, we mostly typed text on websites. When we got phones with cameras, the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. We\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. But this isn\u2019t the end of the line,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe next platform will be even more immersive \u2014 an embodied internet where you\u2019re in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.\n\n\u201cThe defining quality of the metaverse will be a feeling of presence \u2014 like you are right there with another person or in another place. Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology. That is why we are focused on building this.\n\n\u201cIn the metaverse, you\u2019ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine \u2014 get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create \u2014 as well as completely new experiences that don\u2019t really fit how we think about computers or phones today. We made a film that explores how you might use the metaverse one day.\n\n\u201cIn this future, you will be able to teleport instantly as a hologram to be at the office without a commute, at a concert with friends, or in your parents\u2019 living room to catch up. This will open up more opportunity no matter where you live. You\u2019ll be able to spend more time on what matters to you, cut down time in traffic, and reduce your carbon footprint.\n\n\u201cThink about how many physical things you have today that could just be holograms in the future. Your TV, your perfect work setup with multiple monitors, your board games and more \u2014 instead of physical things assembled in factories, they\u2019ll be holograms designed by creators around the world.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll move across these experiences on different devices \u2014 augmented reality glasses to stay present in the physical world, virtual reality to be fully immersed, and phones and computers to jump in from existing platforms. This isn\u2019t about spending more time on screens; it\u2019s about making the time we already spend better.\u201d\n\nOutlining the role and responsibility of the company, he said: \u201cThe metaverse will not be created by one company. It will be built by creators and developers making new experiences and digital items that are interoperable and unlock a massively larger creative economy than the one constrained by today\u2019s platforms and their policies.\n\n\u201cOur role in this journey is to accelerate the development of the fundamental technologies, social platforms and creative tools to bring the metaverse to life, and to weave these technologies through our social media apps. We believe the metaverse can enable better social experiences than anything that exists today, and we will dedicate our energy to helping achieve its potential.\n\n\u201cAs I wrote in our original founder\u2019s letter: \u201cwe don\u2019t build services to make money; we make money to build better services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis approach has served us well. We\u2019ve built our business to support very large and long term investments to build better services, and that\u2019s what we plan to do here.\n\n\u201cThe last five years have been humbling for me and our company in many ways. One of the main lessons I\u2019ve learned is that building products people love isn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gained more appreciation that the internet\u2019s story isn\u2019t straightforward. Every chapter brings new voices and new ideas, but also new challenges, risks, and disruption of established interests. We\u2019ll need to work together, from the beginning, to bring the best possible version of this future to life.\n\n\u201cPrivacy and safety need to be built into the metaverse from day one. So do open standards and interoperability. This will require not just novel technical work \u2014 like supporting crypto and NFT projects in the community \u2014 but also new forms of governance. Most of all, we need to help build ecosystems so that more people have a stake in the future and can benefit not just as consumers but as creators.\n\n\u201cThis period has also been humbling because as big of a company as we are, we\u2019ve also learned what it\u2019s like to build on other platforms. Living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry. I\u2019ve come to believe that the lack of choice for consumers and high fees for developers are stifling innovation and holding back the internet economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take a different approach. We want our services to be accessible to as many people as possible, which means working to make them cost less, not more. Our mobile apps are free. Our ads model is designed to provide businesses the lowest prices. Our commerce tools are available at cost or with modest fees. As a result, billions of people love our services and hundreds of millions of businesses rely on our tools.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the approach we want to bring to helping to build the metaverse. We plan to sell our devices at cost or subsidized to make them available to more people. We\u2019ll continue supporting side-loading and streaming from PCs so people have choice, rather than forcing them to use the Quest Store to find apps or reach customers. And we\u2019ll aim to offer developer and creator services with low fees in as many cases as possible so we can maximize the overall creative economy. We\u2019ll need to make sure we don\u2019t lose too much money along the way though.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.\n\n\u201cAs we embark on this next chapter, I\u2019ve thought a lot about what this means for our company and our identity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a company that focuses on connecting people. While most tech companies focus on how people interact with technology, we\u2019ve always focused on building technology so people can interact with each other.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re seen as a social media company. Facebook is one of the most used technology products in the history of the world. It\u2019s an iconic social media brand.\n\n\u201cBuilding social apps will always be important for us, and there\u2019s a lot more to build. But increasingly, it\u2019s not all we do. In our DNA, we build technology to bring people together. The metaverse is the next frontier in connecting people, just like social networking was when we got started.\n\n\u201cRight now our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future. Over time, I hope we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and our identity on what we\u2019re building towards.\n\n\u201cWe just announced that we\u2019re making a fundamental change to our company. We\u2019re now looking at and reporting on our business as two different segments: one for our family of apps and one for our work on future platforms. Our work on the metaverse is not just one of these segments. The metaverse encompasses both the social experiences and future technology. As we broaden our vision, it\u2019s time for us to adopt a new brand.\n\n\u201cTo reflect who we are and the future we hope to build, I\u2019m proud to share that our company is now Meta.\n\n\u201cOur mission remains the same \u2014 it\u2019s still about bringing people together. Our apps and their brands aren\u2019t changing either. We\u2019re still the company that designs technology around people.\n\n\u201cBut all of our products, including our apps, now share a new vision: to help bring the metaverse to life. And now we have a name that reflects the breadth of what we do.\n\n\u201cFrom now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first. That means that over time you won\u2019t need a Facebook account to use our other services. As our new brand starts showing up in our products, I hope people around the world come to know the Meta brand and the future we stand for.\n\n\u201cI used to study Classics, and the word \u201cmeta\u201d comes from the Greek word meaning \u201cbeyond\u201d. For me, it symbolizes that there is always more to build, and there is always a next chapter to the story. Ours is a story that started in a dorm room and grew beyond anything we imagined; into a family of apps that people use to connect with one another, to find their voice, and to start businesses, communities, and movements that have changed the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve built so far, and I\u2019m excited about what comes next \u2014 as we move beyond what\u2019s possible today, beyond the constraints of screens, beyond the limits of distance and physics, and towards a future where everyone can be present with each other, create new opportunities and experience new things. It is a future that is beyond any one company and that will be made by all of us.\n\n\u201cWe have built things that have brought people together in new ways. We\u2019ve learned from struggling with difficult social issues and living under closed platforms. Now it is time to take everything we\u2019ve learned and help build the next chapter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dedicating our energy to this \u2014 more than any other company in the world. If this is the future you want to see, I hope you\u2019ll join us. The future is going to be beyond anything we can imagine.\u201d",

          "text": "The body of a Customs officer declared missing by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has been found floating on Ipaja River, Yewa South local government area of Ogun State.\n\nAlso, the two officers, who were kidnapped by daredevil smugglers operating in Ogun State, were both found dead in Fagbohun village over interception of smuggled rice meant for the country from Benin Republic.\n\nThe recent killing made it the third officer to be killed by smugglers in the State in the last three weeks.\n\nIn a chat with few journalists, the acting customs area controller, Federal Operations Unit (FOU), Zone A, Ag. Compt.

          "text": "In a last-minute effort to secure a united front in the national convention to elect national officers of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), stakeholders of the party from the South-West zone, have concluded negotiations on candidates to adopt as consensus options.\n\nSources at the consultative meeting held in Lagos on Wednesday said that the stakeholders have concluded on a former Osun State governor, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola as the deputy national chairman (South) and Hon. Debo Ologunagba as the national publicity secretary of the party.\n\nOyinlola and Ologunagba are from Osun and Ondo States respectively.\n\nLeaders of the party who organised the meeting, according to a source, were dissatisfied by the highhanded disposition of Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and thereby forging a united position to checkmate the only PDP governor from the region.\n\nThe meeting, which was learnt to have been attended by state executive officials and elders from Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti States decided to throw support behind Oyinlola on account that he is competent and was the first person to signify intention for the position.\n\nIn addition to that is the claim that the emergence of a former deputy governor of Oyo State, Taofeek Arapaja, was a creation of Governor Makinde.\n\nA source who was part of the meeting said that: \u201cmajority of party officials from other states in the South-West are not happy with the way Governor Makinde has handled the affairs of the party. The PDP in the South-West is one big family and we recognise the fact that the governor is the leader of the party in his state. In the current situation where Governor Makinde is the only PDP governor from the South-West, we recognise him to be the leader of the party from the zone.\n\n\u201cBut leadership requires that you take everybody along. When we organised election for the position of zonal chairman for the PDP in the South-West, Governor Makinde sponsored Arapaja, and even though a large number of people went against his position, we still delivered his candidate in the person of the ssame Taofeek Arapaja from Oyo State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAgain, this time around, after we, the stakeholders of the party had micro-zoned the position of the deputy national chairman to Osun State, and with Prince Oyinlola signifying intention for the post, our leader, Governor Makinde went behind us to bring this same Arapaja from Oyo State against our wish. Oyo State alone is not South-West and we would have expected that this time around, the governor would generously concede the position of deputy national chairman to someone from another state in the zone but he didn\u2019t do that.\n\n\u201cNow, remember that the Osun State governorship election is next to the 2023 general election. It is one election that is crucial for the PDP to win. We, the stakeholders, believe that Prince Oyinlola, having been governor in Osun State and with records of his achievements in office, should be the person to lead our campaign in the Osun State governorship election. For him to play that role well should require that we, as a political party, recognise the asset that we have in Prince Oyinlola and decorate him with the position of deputy national chairman. He has a more colourful appeal than Ambassador Arapaja in leading campaigns in the South-West and that is why today, we are all in agreement that Oyinlola should be the most senior party official in the South-West.\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, we will deliver our votes for him and network with our other colleagues and party members from other zones to affirm support for Oyinlola and secure his victory,\u201d a source who pleaded anonymity explained.",

          "text": "By CHIKA CHIMEZIE\n\n\u2026says State\u2019s debt profile is alarming\n\nThe Senator Andy Uba Governorship Campaign Organisation, SAUGCO has asked former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), Professor Charles Soludo to stop feigning ignorance about the total debt liability of the state he so desperately seeks to govern.\n\nSoludo, candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA in next week\u2019s Anambra governorship election, had while speaking on Channels TV programme, Politics Today, yesterday, shocked the show\u2019s host, Seun Okinbaloye, and viewers when he could not put a figure to the state\u2019s debt profile.\n\nThe usually verbose Professor of Economics had been pointedly asked if he knew what the state\u2019s debt overhang was, and how he intended to deal with it.\n\nInstead of offering a definitive answer, the APGA candidate embarked on a rigmarole, before stating that he would find out when he becomes governor.\n\nUndeterred, Okinbaloye pressed further, pointing out that statistics from the country\u2019s Debt Management Office, DMO, indicated that Anambra owed N60 billion in domestic debt, and $116 million in external loans.\n\nHowever, the real shock emerged when the eminent Professor, renown for his oratorical skills than sound macro economic solutions, said: \u2018We are going to verify that. Borrowed from who, who are the creditors?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe see Soludo\u2019s demurred stance on a very sensitive issue that affects the lives of the people as cheap politics and an attempt to cover up the sins of his pay masters to the detriment of the State.\n\n\u201cWe are however happy that APGA\u2019s antics are already known to the people who are waiting to finally send them packing on November 6.\n\n\u201cIronically, data released by the DMO on December 31, 2020 indicated that Anambra\u2019s domestic debt stood at N59,013 billion as at September 30, 2020, while the state\u2019s external debt profile was $115,886 million as at June, 2020.\n\n\u201cIn deed, it is shocking that a Professor Soludo who should have such information at the tip of his fingers, would elect to play politics with such information crucial to the lifeblood of the state, or was simply being mischievous,\u201d Hon. Victor Afam Ogene, Director, Media and Publicity of the Senator Andy Uba Governorship Campaign Organisation, SAUGCO said in a statement today.\n\n\u201cWhichever is the case, Professor Soludo owes ndi Anambra the patriotic duty of researching into what really is the debt liability of our dear state, Anambra.\n\n\u201cIn fact, for a man who was two years ago, in November 2019, given the task of fashioning out the grandiose 50-year Anambra 2070 Vision Agenda not to be seized of important data such as the profit and loss account of the state, speaks eloquently about his capacity for accomplishing small, practical assignments.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, it is this obvious flaw that caused former Minister of Finance and current Director General of the World Trade Organization, WTO to author a damning confidential report on Soludo in January, 2015.\u201d\n\nOkonjo-Iweala: \u201cThere is definitely an issue of character with Professor Charles Soludo and his desperate search for power and relevance in Nigeria. Nigerians should therefore beware of so-called intellectuals without character and wisdom because this combination is fatal.\u201d\n\nCould this character flaw have been at play when Soludo decided to cover up Governor Willy Obiano\u2019s obsessive borrowing binge, in exchange for his role in seeking to puppeteer him into political office?\n\n\u201cAs an irreducible minimum, the Senator Andy Uba Governorship Campaign Organisation, SAUGCO, requests Professor Soludo to undertake the urgent task of finding out the exact and total debt liability of Anambra state \u2013 for, in accomplishing this task, Professor Soludo would have rendered an invaluable service to a people he so eagerly crave to govern,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu Friday unveiled the new brand identity for the Lagos State Lotteries and Gaming Authority.\n\nThis comes six months after he signed the amended Lagos State Lotteries and Gaming Authority Bill into law, following its passage by the State House of Assembly. The legislation necessitated the name change and the new brand logo.\n\nThe name and brand logo of the agency were unveiled at a ceremony held at the Lagos Oriental Hotels in Victoria Island and fully attended by top government functionaries and private sector stakeholders.\n\nHe officially changed Lagos State Lotteries Board to Lagos State Lotteries and Gaming Authority as part of extensive reforms initiated by his administration to reposition the industry for greater efficiency and stakeholder satisfaction.\n\nWith the new law and new brand identity, Sanwo-Olu said the State\u2019s Lotteries and Gaming Authority was now poised to conduct its business in line with modern technological practices while adopting a more innovative, harmonious, and transparent approach in the regulation of the lotteries and gaming industry.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cThis unveiling ceremony marks a new dawn in the history of lottery and gaming regulation in the Centre of Excellence. The agency has been rebranded to set and enforce gaming standards responsibly and fairly. The goal is to gain and sustain the trust and confidence of all operators and stakeholders in the lottery and gaming business.\n\n\u201cOur administration did the needful by painstakingly collaborating with the House of Assembly to initiate and pass the Lagos State Lotteries and Gaming Authority Bill of 2021, which I signed into law last April.\n\n\u201cThe new law will help to institutionalise major reforms in the Lagos gaming sector and expand the scope of our lotteries and gaming authority\u2019s operations by gaming dynamics across the globe.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, the agency had sustained its revenue-generating momentum since its creation in 2004 during the administration of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nThereafter, he urged the management to sustain the zeal and align the vision of the new brand with the core values of his administration\u2019s T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda.\n\nThe Governor allayed the concerns of gaming operators and investors in the industry about the intergovernmental squabbles over the constitutional responsibilities of the Federal and State governments on the control and regulation of the gaming space.\n\nHowever, he said the Constitution remained clear on the concurrent powers of the Federal and State governments over matters related to lotteries and gaming, assuring operators that their businesses would not be double-taxed.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanwo-Olu advised illegal lottery and gaming operators to obtain operational licenses from the agency, warning that the Government would not hesitate to prosecute any unlicensed operators.\n\n\u201cWith this newly rebranded agency, all the functional elements of the lotteries and gaming industry will be unlocked to create a new model of gaming in Lagos State. I charge the management to forge a transparent and formidable alliance with licensed gaming operators in the State, to create a vibrant Gaming Industry for a more prosperous and sustainable economy,\u201d the Governor said.\n\nChief Executive Officer of the State\u2019s Lotteries and Gaming Authority, Mr Bashir Are, said the agency, under his watch, has recorded landmark achievements in regulating, protecting and promoting best practices in the gaming space.\n\nBased on its compliance with international gaming standards, Are said the agency had received ISO certification in Information Security Management System (ISO 27001) and Quality Management System (ISO 9001) in addition to becoming a full member of the International Association of Gaming Regulators (IAGR) and International Gaming Standard Association (IGSA).\n\n\u201cThere are more than 56,000 full-time employees and gaming agents operating in Lagos. We have deployed an automated system to monitor gaming transactions in our jurisdiction. We also launched an agent registration platform to weed out swindlers from licensed agents.\n\n\u201cFor us, the future has begun and we are excited about the unfolding development in the gaming industry. Our next goal is to focus on creating greater efficiency and sustainable economic value for the State, operators, players and relevant stakeholders in the sector.\u201d\n\nIn the coming days, Are said the agency\u2019s advocacy against underage and addictive gambling would be amplified with fortified policy and sustained campaign.\n\nMs Funmi Olotu, the Governor\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on State Lotteries, stressed that the successful harmonisation of all the State\u2019s gaming regulations had not only corrected disparities in the sector, it also established a uniform framework that would be easily implemented.\n\nThen State Lotteries and Gaming Authority Law of 2021, Olotu said, has also addressed contemporary challenges and issues that may arise from time to time.",

The party is one that has seen all but one of its eight chairmen forced out of office in controversial circumstances.\n\nFrom its pioneer chairman, the late Chief Solomon Lar, to Barnabas Gemade, Audu Ogbeh, Ahmadu Ali, Vincent Ogubulafor, and Okwesilieze Nwodo to Bamanga Tukur, and then Prince Uche Secondus, only one, Amadu Ali, served out his tenure and bowed out without rancour.\n\nThe late Lar was booted out of office by former President Olusegun Obasanjo a few months after he assumed office as president in 1999. His successor, Barnabas Gemade who played an influential role during Obasanjo\u2019s administration, was later shown the door in 2001 after his relationship with Obasanjo got sour.\n\nThe exit of Gemade paved the way for the Audu Ogbeh-led NWC. Ogbeh\u2019s tenure is perhaps the most dramatic of all as he was forced to resign in December 2004, allegedly at gunpoint, after its much-talked about letter to the president advising Obasanjo to act on the anarchy that had taken over Anambra state, where the then godfather, Chris Uba, a known supporter of the president, had allegedly overrun the state and taken its governor, Chris Ngige, captive.\n\nLike Ogbeh, another Obasanjo\u2019s friend, Ahmadu Ali, was made the party\u2019s national chairman. Though he served his term, he left without a second term. Consequently, Vincent Ogbulafor was elected the new chairman at the party\u2019s national convention of 2008. However, as a result of a bitter feud with his state governor, Theodore Orji, over the party\u2019s structure in the South-east, Ogbulafor was charged with corruption and forced to resign in May 2010.\n\nOkwesilieze Nwodo who succeeded Ogbulafor also left sometime around 2012 under controversial circumstances after a dispute with his governor, Sullivan Chime. Similarly, Bamanga Tukur who took over ran into troubles also at home where his control of the party structure in Adamawa state was challenged by Governor Murtala Nyako. He was booted out in 2014.\n\nThe present\n\nLike many others, the Prince Uche Secondus-led NWC problems started when he failed to support Governor Nyesom Wike\u2019s plot to install the Sokoto state governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, as the party\u2019s presidential candidate in 2018. However, the fear of him hijacking the party\u2019s structure for the 2023 presidential aspirants, Wike and others succeeded in getting Secondus sacked by a competent court.\n\nCumulatively, the PDP governors have continued to install their choices of NWC and sacking them at will. This has led to mass defections of party members from state to national levels, and this has affected their performances in many elections. While this remains a great concern to the party\u2019s supporters, analysts believe that the act will continue to affect the party\u2019s internal democracy.\n\nThe convention\n\nOf all the positions, only those of the national auditor, national youth leader and deputy national chairman (South) would be contested out at the convention ground as the others have already been concluded on a consensus arrangement.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman, conventional planning committee, the governor of Adamawa state, Ahmadu Fintiri, has disclosed that 3,600 delegates were expected to participate at this year\u2019s national elective convention of the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are expecting 3, 600 delegates tomorrow. This is the exact reason I told you that I\u2019ll be updating you because we\u2019re still packaging the list of delegates. You know PDP has produced a lot of officials for this country and our Constitution has also allowed for some former this and former that. We have people that have crossed over to the other side, so have to be careful so that we don\u2019t include them. But at the moment I think we\u2019re satisfied.\u201d\n\nConsensus convention, issues\n\nKeen followers of political events in the country are of the view that the main opposition party seems not to have learnt any lessons from the imposition of candidates and leaders which largely led to its downfall after reigning supreme as a ruling party for sixteen years.\n\nAs the party prepares to elect its national officials across the country today and tomorrow, tension is high as a result of what perhaps can be described as a \u201cfailed consensus.\u201d\n\nThough zoning, micro-zoning and consensus remain alien to the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria and that of the PDP, they have now become a norm. Like in the past, the party zoned and micro-zoned the positions available in the NWC; this development has increased tension among party members. Consequently, many aspirants are not comfortable going for the election; one of such aspirants is Okey Muo-Aroh, who wanted to run for national secretary before he was disqualified for allegedly taking the party to court.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome people are bragging that there was a consensus candidate; this is the bane of the party in the South-east. We have a situation where the party in its wisdom zones offices to the South-east, and nobody was privy to any arrangement. We only heard that the office of the national secretary has been zoned to Anambra auditor to Imo state.\n\n\u201cThat was why Hon. CID Maduabum, Osita Chidoka and I started having consultations and moving around, only for us to come to Enugu on Thursday and the zonal chairman said the governors would brief us. The Enugu state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, introduced the Abia state governor, Okezie Victor Ikpeazu. And Governor Okezie Victor Ikpeazu read from a script and said they had changed their mind, and that they have put the secretary to Imo state and their candidate is Senator Sam Daddy Anyanwu. And they pronounced somebody from Anambra as the auditor. So, on that basis, the people of Anambra rejected that so-called arrangement.\u201d\n\nAlso, in the same South-east, a former national publicity secretary of the party, Chief Olisa Metuh, had a misunderstanding with the former Anambra state governor, Peter Obi, on the choice of candidate for the national auditor.\n\nMetuh, in a statement signed by his special assistant, Ebiloma Abdullahi, recently said, \u201cWhile we concede to the former governor and acknowledge his stories on moral values to the general public, we are totally against his lack of consultation, dialogue and inclusion on matters affecting party administration; an area where he knows little or nothing about.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that in the South-east caucus meeting of the PDP, Peter Obi himself led the rejection of a name put forward by Senator Ekwunife as a candidate for the position of the national auditor, wherein he openly stated that the person is not known to him and the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that this position was re-echoed by the entire Anambra stakeholders present at the meeting except for Senator Ekwunife. However, 24 hours later, the same Peter Obi, a man said to be of very high moral standard, somersaulted to claim the adoption of the same name without any form of dialogue or consultation.\u201d\n\nGrudges\n\nIn the South-west too, many are aggrieved over the zoning and micro-zoning arrangement. A former secretary of the party, Professor Wale Ladipo, and former national vice-chairman (South), Dr. Eddy Olafeso, both alluded to the fact that they were disqualified to force a consensus candidate on the zone and the party at large.\n\nReacting to his disqualification, Prof. Ladipo said, \u201cYes, I saw it coming. I have been joking with some members of our party in Osun state over the last one week that it has been in the public domain that certain people were not comfortable with my candidature. They said clearly that I would be screened out. I thought it was impossible, but then it became a reality. I spoke to people who are close to me and I said I was not going to the screening because I hate \u2018arrangee things.\u2019 I like people to be straightforward. We spoke to senior members of the party and they said I should go for the screening and see how it goes. And lo and behold, about 10 minutes before my appearance before the screening committee, somebody brought a petition and hurriedly gave it to them. Up till now, I have not been privileged to read the petition.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Dr. Olafeso said: \u201cThis is pure politics to scheme me and others out of the race.\u201d\n\nPolitical pundits believe that this type of consensus has increased the level of tension in the party, which if not properly managed may make some people leave the party.\n\nAn aspirant who does not want his name mentioned in print told Blueprint Weekend that many people never consented to the consensus arrangement, adding that \u201cconsensus candidates were forced on us.\u201d\n\nHe told this reporter that, \u201cI was told to step down; in fact they stopped me from purchasing forms. Some of us felt that the issue of consensus should be discussed, but in this case, we were more or less forced.\n\n\u201cThey invited me and others for a series of meetings, and said you step down, this is the person that we want, I felt so bad. To me, all positions should be open for all and the delegates should decide the fate of every aspirant. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as consensus candidates were forced on us.\u201d\n\nGov. Fintiri\u2019s reaction\n\nReacting to allegations that some aspirants were forced to step down, the chairman of the convention planning committee, Governor Fintiri said aspirants were not forced to step down.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re making efforts to reconcile most of our contestants so that we can streamline them to have a better Convention which will be hitch-free and will deepen our chances for 2021. Most of the positions as of today, except for three, will not be contested for.\n\n\u201cThe problems have reduced significantly and we will keep posting as the events unfold. At the moment we are talking to those that are contesting for the office of the deputy national chairman (South) and those that are contesting for the office of the auditor, and those that are now contested for the office of youth leader. I think at the moment it is just the offices that still have many people contesting for. The rest have been streamlined and the consensus looks okay.\n\n\u201cLike I told you, there are positions and there are people that we\u2019re still talking to. We\u2019re not forcing anybody to step down and the candidates are talking amongst themselves.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s take\n\nA political analyst, Jide Ojo, said the aftermath of an improper consensus arrangement is not always palatable. Ojo, in a telephone chat with this reporter, said: \u201cI am not a fan of consensus arrangements, but the political leaders who initiated that did it because they thought it is a better arrangement to how people negotiate for political offices than to fight for the political offices at a ballot.\n\n\u201cBut we know that it has also backfired to an extent. The way it has been playing out in Nigeria is synonymous with imposition. And when you impose candidates, the aftermath of that is always not palatable. This is because what then happens is that people who felt bad may end up defecting from the party to another. But if they have agreed through horse-trading and it works out well, then it may go well. For those who are opposed to a consensus I think it is always good to allow people to vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\n\u201cThe way the consensus arrangements have been done is another way for imposition of candidates.\u201d\n\nTambuwal\u2019s hope\n\nIn his reaction, the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, the Sokoto state governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, said the party \u201cwill come out of the national convention united.\u201d\n\nTambuwal, who stated this recently, said: \u201cWe have just finished our meeting where we received briefings from the chairman of the convention planning/organising committee, the governor of Adamawa state, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, that we are on course and by the grace of God, they have almost concluded every arrangement and plan for a very successful, free and fair convention.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to the convention planning committee and other sub-committees for the work they are doing. We are optimistic that PDP is going to come out more united from this convention and much more ready to provide the desired platform upon which many Nigerians can realise their aspirations. And we shall continue to deepen our democracy and work together as democrats for a greater Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The Appeal Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State has granted the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) the right to hold its national convention scheduled for October 30 and 31, 2021.\n\nDelivering the ruling on behalf of two other justices on Friday, Justice Gabriel Kolawole held that the attempt by the applicant, Uche Secondus, to suspend the planned convention is an act of \u201cself-induced urgency\u201d to disrupt an ongoing lawful process of the party.\n\nHe wondered why Uche Secondus waited for too long to seek the stoppage of the process which had been communicated to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by the acting national chairman of the party, Yemi Akinwonmi, who Secondus duly handed over to.\n\nThe judge also held that Secondus did not oppose the notice of the convention written by the acting chairman to INEC and did not also oppose INEC replying to the PDP through the acting chairman.\n\nREAD ALSO\n\nSecondus Vows To Challenge Appeal Court Ruling\n\nPDP Crisis Being Propelled By APC \u2013 Dino Melaye\n\nPDP Governors Hold Closed-Door Meeting With Mimiko In Ondo\n\nMeanwhile, the lawyer to Secondus, Tayo Oyetibo, said his client will wait for the outcome of the main suit on his status as the chairman and a member of the party before the same court to determine whether or not to go on appeal.\n\nHe, however, maintained that an outcome in favour of his client will definitely have a consequential effect on the convention slated for Abuja.\n\nWike reacts\n\nA chieftain of the PDP and Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has reacted to the ruling.\n\nMr. Wike said the ruling was a victory for every member of the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is a victory for every member of PDP,\u201d Wike told reporters. \u201cIt is a sign that PDP is prepared for 2023.\u201d\n\nThe Governor said Mr Secondus had already handed over his chairmanship to PDP National Deputy Chairman (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, and had no right to seek the postponement of the convention.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cWe will not allow any individual or groups to derail the rescue mission of the PDP,\u201d he said. \u201cThe title of our convention is \u2018Join us to rescue Nigeria\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in problem and we cannot do it alone. We require everybody to work with us for collectively and see how this country can be rescued.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is anybody or group who are being used to derail us, PDP will not take it lightly. We are serious about it and nothing will stop us from rescuing this country.\n\n\u201cPDP should be thanking God Almighty. We should be jubilating and praising God for bringing unity to this country.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the Court of Appeal judgement granted PDP an \u201cunrestrained\u201d right to hold the convention, making any other court judgement obtained to halt the process irrelevant.\n\nSecondus vows to appeal\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Secondus has said he will challenge the ruling of the Appeal Court, according to a statement obtained by Channels Television.\n\n\u201cI have just been briefed of the ruling of the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt dismissing my motion to halt the National Convention of the party,\u201d he said. \u201cI respect the position of the court even though I disagree totally with it.\n\n\u201cEven as the substantive case is still pending at the Court of Appeal I have instructed my lawyers to study the ruling with a view to appealing it immediately as no abuse of the constitution of our dear party should be allowed to stand.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not about Prince Uche Secondus but about the sanctity of our party constitution and core democratic principles of justice and rule of law not only in PDP but in our democracy. No impunity must be condoned.\n\n\u201cI will therefore wish to emphasis the fact that I did not take the party to court and would not have done that. As a foundation member of this party who has served at various levels, State Chairman, Chairman of state Chairmen, National Organizing Secretary, Deputy National Chairman, Acting National Chairman and now National Chairman, am very much abreast with the workings of the party. I have been a witness to how much harm litigations have done to our party in the past and as a result I have been a strong advocate against settling issues in courts.\n\n\u201cThis was why I resisted and rejected entreaties of those who wanted me to go to court to halt these forces when it was obvious that they were determined to disrupt my leadership and truncate my tenure in office with the sole objective of hijacking the party for their selfish ulterior motives.\n\n\u201cTo allow this travesty to stand is to reduce our beloved party to a level where anybody can wake up over night and remove officers against the proscribed constitutional process and the National Chairman for that matter. And purporting to use the judiciary through an experte order to legitimize same.\n\n\u201cAs a major practitioner in our democracy, I am duty bound to protect and defend the sanctity of the provisions of our constitution of which am the custodian.\n\n\u201cI wish to therefore at this juncture thank and appreciate leaders and other stakeholders of our party who have called in to express their concerns on this matter and appeal for the understanding of all.\n\n\u201cIf those who orchestrated and fostered this avoidable crisis had listened to wise counsel of party leaders and elders who advised the withdrawal of cases, this situation would have been avoidable. I wish the party well as always.\u201d",

Our partnership with Standard Bank demonstrates that fintechs and banks are not competitors but trusted partners with the key focus being the customer. We plan to grow financial and digital inclusion through this partnership and in the long run, we expect to generate more jobs in the digital economy and enable rapid business growth across the continent\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking during the announcement, Chief Executive Officer of Client Solutions at Standard Bank, Margaret Nienaber, stated, \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step in Standard Bank\u2019s platform journey expanding from our leadership position in traditional financial services to meet clients on the digital platforms where they are shopping, socialising and doing business.\n\n\u201cPartnerships with innovative fintechs like Flutterwave underpin our strategy by integrating our scale and expertise across the African continent with the services and offerings of our partners to offer an expanded range of solutions, delivered in a seamless manner to our clients\u201d.\n\nThe Chief Executive of Africa Regions at Standard Bank, Yinka Sanni, while reinforcing the importance of the partnership to clients across the continent, said, \u201cStandard Bank has an almost 160-year history of serving clients and supporting economic development in Africa.

          "text": "The premarket trading Friday is putting Microsoft Corp. on pace to become the world\u2019s largest listed company by market capitalisation, after a drop in Apple\u2019s shares.\n\nApple fell 3.6% to $147.10 in premarket trading after reporting fourth-quarter revenue that came in below the average analyst estimate.\n\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s market value would fall to $2.41 trillion should shares continue to trade at this level during regular hours.\n\nMicrosoft closed at a market value of $2.44 trillion on Thursday, blowing past Apple after reporting estimate-topping results for an 11th straight quarter earlier this week.\n\nAccording to the head trader at US Global Investors, Michael Matousek, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for safety in tech, Microsoft probably seems like a safer bet to me than Apple. \u201cIf there was a downturn in the economy, I would expect Microsoft to stand up better, because its products are diversified across more businesses\u201d.\n\nThe last time Microsoft dethroned Apple was in the first half of 2020 as investors flocked into growth stocks amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Microsoft was little changed in premarket trading as of 7:00 a.m. in New York.\n\nIn June, Microsoft took its place in the history books as just the second US public company to reach a $2 trillion market value, buoyed by bets its dominance in cloud computing and enterprise software will expand further in a post-coronavirus world.\n\nIts shares have outperformed Apple and Amazon.com Inc. this year on expectations of long-term growth for both earnings and revenue, and expansion in areas like machine learning and cloud computing. Microsoft is up more than 40%, while Apple is 15% higher and Amazon is up about 6%.\n\nIts shares aren\u2019t cheap, trading at a 20 percent premium to the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index. But lofty valuations haven\u2019t stopped investors from adding to their positions in tech stocks this year. The Nasdaq 100 Index is on pace with the S&P 500 Index with a more than 22% rally each and the Nasdaq Composite is up about 20 percent.\n\nMatousek said, \u201cSize begets size and strength begets strength. This is the sort of thing that is nice to see; Microsoft was a rock star in the 90\u2019s \u2014 one of the four horsemen \u2013 and it has clearly gotten its mojo back\u201d.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
