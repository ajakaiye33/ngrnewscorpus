At the last count, eight members of the House of Representatives from APGA and PDP joined the APC.\n\n\u201cJust this afternoon, the Deputy Governor of Anambra State joined the APC and has been presented to the President. If there is any strong parameter for conducting an opinion poll, this exodus of legislators and the second-in-command in Anambra State, should automatically translate into electoral victory.\u201d\n\nOn the claim by Governor Willie Obiano that APC was giving N100m to defectors from the other parties, Uzodimma said he would not want to \u201cjoin issues\u201d with the Anambra governor.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat means that APC is working. So, I don\u2019t want to lament. In political programme, you can lobby people. And I don\u2019t think APC has money to buy people.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God, the way we are going, I won\u2019t be surprised if everybody in Anambra declares for APC before the election, including the governor.\n\n\u201cWell, if the governor wants to come and collect money, we will give it to him.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Thus, it is logical to consider restructuring BDC operations to weed out the dysfunctional units and operators bringing out the real outfits for operational efficiency. These can be achieved through the design of a dynamic operational modalities of standard practices.\n\n\u201cThe refined outfits can effectively operate on independent transparent platforms dealing in autonomous funds in the economy. They should be permitted to operate as a fully independent foreign exchange professional under the best practices in international foreign exchange operations. Medium scale dealers in foreign exchange should be permitted to operate a lower platform to the Investors and Exporters (I&E) market under a transparent clearing house modalities.\n\n\u201cThe market or platform will compete for funds in the global foreign exchange market thereby deriving a merger and stability in exchange rate in the economy. This is a basic solution to the divergent and multiple exchange rates regimes plaguing the Nigerian foreign exchange market for ages.\u201d\n\nABCON also called on the CBN to investigate the actual causes of the depreciation since July 2nd when it suspended dollar sales to BDCs and why the Deposit Money Banks were unable to bridge the gap of supplying foreign exchange to satisfy the demand earlier fulfilled by BDCs",

Federal Road Maintenance Agency, FERMA, and contractor handling the various road projects in the country, where they are promised to fix failed portions of critical roads across the Federation.\n\nThe Director, Highways Construction and Rehabilitation, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Funso Adebiyi, who opened the discussion, said the current raining season has affected many sections of the road across the country.\n\nHe hinted that there is need for urgent palliative works on such roads to avoid further deterioration, adding that such roads were identified.\n\nHe said the affected roads have been mapped out and will be awarded to contractors for palliative work as part of preparation for Ember Months.\n\nAccording to him, the total cost for the repair works is estimated to cost N75,765,087,178.28 to carry out palliative works on those road.\n\nIn his address, the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola appealed to stakeholders in the road sector to rededicate their efforts towards improving safety and sanity on the high ways.\n\nFashola said that the government is doing is to move almost the Cargos by road and as Railway network is fast and I hope that we will divert all our Cargos to Railway track. So that is when we will have full long time value of the road.\n\nThe President Muhammadu Buhari administration is making efforts to ensure that overloaded trucks no longer ply the nation\u2019s highways.\n\nAccording to him, a measurement scale device installed on a computer will be put in place around the nation to ensure that trucks and haulage vans do not convey excess goods.\n\n\u201cYou may not be aware of this that the government is building the Kano, Lagos and the Abeokuta pipeline and we want to see Petrol Tankers, Timber going on Railway and we hope this can relieve pressure on the road.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to road users, NUPENG, NATO, NURTW and FRSC that we have to works together. Our responsibility is to ensure safety of the road users.\n\n\u201cAll the data that we have about the road show us that most of the accidents on the road are as a result of speed violation.\n\nAccording to him, speed violation, loss of control, traffic light violation, dangerous driving, wrongful overtaking, among others, the causes of all road crashes across the country. So if you reduce the speed there will be less road accident. So let us try it this time around.\n\n\u201cWe are going to start our restrictions with over loading.We are going to start it in Lagos at the Tollgate.\n\n\u201cIf you carry over load you will pay fines So the reason we have done that is that we want to make it cheaper to comply and very expensive to break the law. That way, we hope that people will choose to comply instead of paying excessive penalties,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his response, NUPENG Deputy National Chairman, Lucky Osezuwa, appealed to the government to made good the promise to fix the roads, adding that they shelved the planned industrial action because of the engagement with the Federal Government.",

However, in the video after the accident, he was clearly seen driving the truck steadily and in control, without any indication of any faulty braking system.\n\nChecks by our correspondent from the video confirmed that the Caterpillar driver approached the barrier from the side of the barrier, not in front or from behind, he drove from the side at a rather awkward angle.\n\nThe Caterpillar truck did not proceed towards the concrete fence just beyond the barrier, a fact that would be evident if it was indeed a case of a failed braking system.\n\nThe TTP management has confirmed that the Caterpillar truck driver has been apprehended and handed over to the police, describing the open sabotage of the call-up system as a sad development.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Romanus Ugwu, Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji, Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nApplause and knocks have greeted the decision of the Senate to give the Independent National Electronic Commission the green light to transmit results of elections electronically in the conduct of the 2023 general elections and the adoption of direct primaries method.\n\nThose who hailed the lawmakers included the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ebonyi Professionals Forum (EPF), Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, former Senate deputy president, Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu and\n\nThe upper legislative chamber had reconsidered its earlier position and gave the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) the nod to determine the mode to transmit election results: either electronically or manually.\n\nIt also reversed its earlier position and approved that all political parties must use the direct primary mode in picking candidates. This, however, drew the ire of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) and Governor Wike.\n\nIn its earlier amendment passed in July, Senate had approved both direct and indirect methods.\n\nThe landmark moves came barely 24 hours after Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Villa on Monday.\n\nThe decision of the Senate, followed the re-committal of some clauses of the Electoral Act 2010 to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nIn July, the Senate, rejected its committee\u2019s report, which had approved electronic transmission of results by INEC. The House of Representatives, however, approved it.\n\nThe Senate, said: \u201cAfter critical examination of the Bill by the Senate Committee on INEC, some fundamental issues which require fresh legislative action on clauses 43, 52, 63 and 87, were observed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDesirous of the need to address the observations by the committee and make necessary amendments, and relying on Order 1(b) and 53(6) of the Senate Standing Order, accordingly resolves to rescind its decision on the affected clauses of the Bill as passed and re-commit same to the Committee of the Whole for consideration and passage,\u201d Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi stated while moving the motion.\n\nThe Senate, had in July, while rejecting the position of its Committee on INEC, opted for a position, which was outrightly rejected by Nigerians.\n\nThe senate approved four clauses in the electoral act amendment bill. Part of the clause amended, read: \u201cSubject to section 63 of this Bill, voting at an election and transmission of results under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission (INEC), which may include electronic voting.\n\n\u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the Commission.\u201d\n\nDaily Sun had reported that plans were underway to force direct method of conducting primary elections on political parties.\n\nGovernor Wike said the resolution of the National Assembly joint committee to allow the electoral umpire transmit election results electronically is a good development for Nigeria and democracy.\n\n\u201cI think it is a good news to hear that the Joint Committee of the House of Representatives and the Senate agreed for INEC to transmit result electronically. That is a good news to hear. Like I have always said, what is important now is what do people want. The moment you do what the people want you\u2019ll see happiness everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who has been a proponent of transparent electoral system, observed that many nations have moved beyond manual result declaration and Nigeria cannot afford in the 21st century to be left behind.\n\nOn the amendment of the Electoral Act, Governor Wike stated that the issue of direct or indirect primaries should be the exclusive decision of the political parties in the country.\n\nGovernor Wike insisted that National Assembly prescribing how political parties conduct their primaries is tantamount to interference in the internal politics of the parties.\n\nIPAC also believe that electronic transmission of results would go a long way in deepening the nation\u2019s political process critical for inclusive, free, fair, credible, transparent and generally acceptable elections.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, IPAC, Ambassador Agbo Major, in a statement released said: \u201cReversing itself is a giant step forward in making Nigeria a great arsenal of democracy in Africa. Manipulation of election results, ballot box snatching, violence, vote buying and selling are the bane of the nation\u2019s electoral process.\n\nFormer VP Atiku, in a statement by his media office, yesterday, said the harmonisation of positions between the parliament and the electoral body was an indication that the country\u2019s democracy is growing.\n\nHe also commended individuals and groups, especially the various pro-democracy advocacy groups that participated in the public discourse on the controversial issue.\n\n\u201cBy this outcome, I am convinced that public institutions in Nigeria will continue to play their roles as guardians of public policy.\u201d\n\nSpokesman of ADF, Abia Onyike and National Secretary of Ebonyi Professionals, Ugochukwu Hanks-Ezekiel, described it as a progressive move indicative that power belongs to the people. They said it would go a long way to guarantee free and fair elections in Nigeria.\n\nOn the issue of direct primaries, Onyike said: \u201cIt is equally a welcome development because the members of political parties would have a say in who their candidates for elections should be. The power is being removed from few delegates who can be easily bought over by money bags.\u201d\n\nFor Hanks-Ezekiel, it is a sign of the people\u2019s power to stand together. He also noted that direct primaries would end Godfatherism in the nation\u2019s polity.\n\nEkweremadu said the Senate\u2019s action justified his assurances to Nigerians in July that all hope was not lost for electronic transmission of 2023 election results despite the initial setback.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, Ekweremadu said: \u201cI want to specially commend the Senate for setting aside narrow partisan interests to correct the mistake of July 15, 2021 by reversing itself on the issue of electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cThis clause, though not originally part of the Bill, was introduced by the Joint National Assembly Committee on the Independent National Electoral Commission, which I am part of, to save the nation the troubles of ballot box snatching, electoral violence, and manipulations that happen between the polling booth and collation centres. Although I was representing Nigeria at an international parliamentary session in Montenegro and therefore unavoidably absent during the passage of the Bill in July, I had assured Nigerians that we would work with the progressives across party lines to dialogue with our colleagues and other critical stakeholders to ensure that electronic transmission of results was restored in the Bill. It is, therefore, heart-warming that my confidence in the capacity of my colleagues to dialogue and rise above narrow partisan interest on this matter was not misplaced.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "The Speaker, Abia State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Chinedum Orji and Chairman/CEO, Marco Polo Group of Companies, Chief Frank Okafor, have described The Sun awards as a great honour to them and their organisations.\n\nThey also described The Sun as an example of purposeful journalism, saying the newspaper has done a lot to give Nigerians a voice.\n\nSpeaking at separate meetings with a delegation of The Sun Publishing Ltd, led by the Managing Director/ Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh, who visited them in Umuahia and Lagos to present letters notifying them of their emergence as winners of The Sun Public Service Award 2020 and The Sun Investor of the Year 2020, Orji and Okafor commended the newspaper for revolutionalising journalism in Nigeria.\n\nThey expressed happiness for being recognised by a platform which respects the ethics of journalism in its operations.\n\nThe Sun Awards, Abia Speaker said, will spur him to further contribute more to the development of the state.\n\nOrji said he had declined several awards offered him by some organisations, but said he had to accept that of The Sun because of the credibility and reputation of the newspaper.\n\nThe Speaker said The Sun has endeared itself to Nigerians because of its insistence on recoganising excellence.\n\n\u201cI have perused the list of those given awards by your organisation in the past and came to the conclusion that the awards are not for all comers, but for those who have excelled in their various endeavours. \u201cI like constructive criticism and that\u2019s exactly what The Sun Newspaper is doing. You criticise individuals who are not doing well in their areas of concern, including the federal government and even world bodies, when they derail. You also praise those who deserve it. I believe that is what journal- ism is all about.\u201d He admonished The Sun \u201cto continue to critically appraise politicians so that we can be on our toes, be up and doing so that the society will be better for all. \u201cI\u2019m not the type who always like to face the press but I must say here that because of the credibility of The Sun Newspaper and the respect I have for its editorial team, it was the first newspaper I granted an interview.\u201d Orji dedicated the award to his colleagues in the House whom he said have continue to stand by him. \u201cIf I did not get the support of my colleagues and the House did not do well, there\u2019s no way we will receive this honour,\u201d he said. On his part, Okafor expressed happiness that his efforts in the business world are being recognition. \u201cI have witnessed a couple of The Sun Awards with friends and business associates. I am proud of the previous awards winners. I must say, however, that I\u2019m very surprised about this honour being given to me. My surprise is that I do not know how the management of The Sun got to know so much about my business and me. The Sun management seems to know me more than myself.\u201d Earlier, Ukeh praised Orji and Okafor for excelling in their different areas of focus . Listing some outstanding achievements of Orji, The Sun MD said: \u201cThe Speaker is part of the Abia House of Assembly that passed the anti grazing bill into law, long before the South came out with a decision on that. The Assembly could be said to have seen tomorrow and acted promptly. \u201cThe Speaker, among other things, has shown leadership as well as doing much to uplift humanity. As part of his pro- gramme for talent hunt, he is constructing nine mini-stadia in his constituency. He gave members of the House excellent environment by remoulding the House of Assembly to a world class environment.\u201d For Okafor, he said: \u201cAside from importation and real estate, you have invested also in hospitality sector with Marco Polo Hotels and Suites.\u201d Hesaid Okafor\u2019svision of providing housing for all made Marco Polo Properties develop houses for different classes: low, medium and high individual. The Sun Awards ceremony holds on Saturday, October 16, 2021 at the Expo Convention Center, Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.

          "text": "\u2022Directs SGF to convene quarterly meetings to review govt\u2019s priority areas\n\n\u2022Okonjo-Iweala: Cost of Nigeria\u2019s trade too high to attract investments\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nWith just 19 months and two weeks to finishing his two terms of eight years tenure, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, directed ministers and permanent secretaries to redouble their efforts and work in synergy towards total delivery of his administration\u2019s set target to improve the livelihood of all Nigerians.\n\nThe president, who gave the charge at Abuja, during his closing remarks at the end of a two-day Mid-term Ministerial performance review retreat, also instructed the ministers to, \u201cramp up implementation\u201d of their mandates along the nine priority areas of his administration.\n\nThis is just as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who spoke during one of the sessions at the retreat, lamented that cost of Nigeria\u2019s trade was too high to attract foreign investors\n\nBuhari, who further mandated the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha to convene quarterly meetings to enable them further review the administration\u2019s priority areas, stressed the need for synergy between the fiscal and monetary authorities in the country to keep the economy on the trajectory of growth.\n\nIn the same shared spirit, the president directed the Head of Service, Dr. Folashade Yemi-Esan, to as a matter of urgency, invest in capacity strengthening of the Planning, Research and Statistics departments in all MDAs.\n\nBuhari noted that intensive discussions at the retreat provided an opportunity to reflect on what this administration had done and the areas it needed to improve and refocus attention.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe retreat provided an opportunity for us to undertake an objective assessment of our stewardship in line with the contract we signed with the Nigerian people to deliver on our electoral promises. From the assessment report and discussions at this retreat, I am glad to note that progress has been made towards the achievement of our objectives.\n\n\u201cThe independent performance assessment report presented on day one of the retreat, indicates that significant progress has been achieved in the delivery of the Ministerial Mandates. Distinguished participants, the discussions at the retreat have prompted the need for us to ramp up implementation on the deliverables.\n\n\u201cWe must close the gaps in our implementation efforts to ensure that we attain set targets by 2023.\u201d\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the president directed Mustapha to immediately begin the process of convening quarterly coordination meetings for each priority area based on the collaborative results framework.\n\nHe explained that the aim of the meetings was to ascertain status of implementation across the nine priority areas, identify bottlenecks, and proffer immediate solutions.\n\n\u201cAll Ministers and Permanent Secretaries must be in attendance. These are not meetings to delegate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also instructed the Office of the SGF to immediately commence engagement with stakeholders to agree and push forward a framework for the institutionalisation of the Central Delivery Coordinating Unit.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAll Ministers and Permanent Secretaries are to promote a robust performance culture across the Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) by setting up intra-ministerial delivery task teams.\u201d\n\nDirecting the Head of Service to as a matter of urgency, invest in capacity strengthening of the Planning, Research and Statistics departments in all MDAs, Buhari added that the initiative should be done in collaboration with the Central Delivery Coordinating Unit.\n\nWhile underscoring the need for synergy between the fiscal and monetary authorities, the President assured Nigerians that his administration would continue to implement fiscal measures to improve domestic revenues and mobilise external funding support to build a more resilient economy.\n\nHe pledged that issues around expanding access to quality education, affordable healthcare and productivity of Nigerians would be given priority attention within the period of this administration.\n\n\u201cWe will sustain all on-going efforts in rebuilding our health system through targeted investment in the health sector, especially, our vaccination drive to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis administration remains committed to providing the education and training required for employment and entrepreneurship, particularly using technology to impact the relevant skills on our youths.\n\n\u201cOur Social Investment Programmes will be sustained in the coming years. We will continue to reach out to the poorest and most vulnerable households through the National Cash Transfer Programme and other initiatives of government.\u201d\n\nThe president further directed the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, to come up with a legislative framework for social protection that also guaranteed its funding stream.\n\nAlso, in view of the critical role of micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) in economic growth and development, he added that, efforts would be geared towards removing all bottlenecks that militate against access to government support schemes by MSMEs.\n\n\u201cGovernment will adopt a holistic approach to industrialisation that is aligned with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations and requirements, working closely with key stakeholders in the private sector. We will continue to support SMEs in view of their multiplier effect on the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the National Single Window Project, the President also directed the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to ensure all relevant MDAs involved in the implementation of the projects complete all processes needed for effective take-off of the National Single Window platform by first quarter of 2022.\n\nHe spoke on the administration\u2019s determination to build systems to fight corruption and improve governance, saying, \u201cWe will continue to address the issues that foster corruption and impair transparency in the management of public resources. Efforts will be geared towards improving coordination and synergy between anti-corruption agencies.\u201d\n\nOn infrastructure, the president promised that the federal government would prioritise funding and ensure that all high-priority ongoing infrastructure projects were completed before the end of his administration.\n\nHe announced that the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund would continue to support the delivery of legacy infrastructure projects across the country.\n\nAccording to Buhari, the nine priority areas set out by the administration included building a thriving and sustainable economy, enhancing social inclusion and poverty reduction, enlarging agricultural output for food security and export as well as attaining energy sufficiency in power and petroleum products.\n\nOthers were expanding transport and other infrastructure development, business growth, entrepreneurship and industrialisation; access to quality education, affordable healthcare and productivity of Nigerians.\n\nThe administration has also prioritised building a system to fight corruption, improve governance and create social cohesion as well as security for all.\n\nMeanwhile, Okonjo-Iweala, a former Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of Economy under the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan, spoke of the need to improve the nation\u2019s security in order to attract foreign and domestic investments.\n\nThe WTO DG said the country must cut down not only its trade cost, but also infrastructure cost, linkage cost, regulatory cost, customs cost, and all costs associated with moving goods from the factory to the final consumer to complement investment facilitation.\n\nShe pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s trade cost was equivalent of 306 per cent tariff, one and half times higher than the cost in high income countries.\n\nAccording to her, congestion, capacity constraints and high costs at Nigerian ports do not encourage investment as they make it difficult to build supply chain operations in the country.\n\nShe said: \u201cImproving security and lowering transaction cost for foreign investment, even for domestic investment, would be necessary. And Nigeria is part of a group of countries negotiating an agreement on investment facilitation at the WTO.\n\n\u201cOnce this agreement is negotiated, ratified and is being implemented, it could be instrumental in attracting additional trade-oriented investment.\n\n\u201cTo complement investment facilitation, Nigeria has to cut down on trade cost, infrastructure cost, linkage cost, regulatory cost, customs cost, basically, all costs associated with moving goods from tie factory or farm gate to the final consumer.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s trade costs are too high. According to the World Bank-ESCAP trade costs for 2019, trade costs for African countries are on average equivalent of a 304% tariff and for Nigeria, it\u2019s even slightly higher at 306 per cent.\n\n\u201cThese numbers are one and half times higher than trade cost in high income countries. Such high costs are not conducive to forming regional value chain.\n\n\u201cCongestion, capacity constraints and high costs in our ports make life difficult for anyone seeking to build supply chain operations in Nigeria and hence, expand trade from there.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber",
          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "China\u2019s growing influence is transforming African tech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years is a long time, and in the startup scene, it can often seem like forever. In the nine years since its founding, Savannah Fund-backed startups have raised follow-on funding of over $200 million. Techpoint Africa caught up with Mbwana Alliy, the firm\u2019s Managing Partner and chatted on what drives the firm\u2019s investments and future plans.\n\nBefore starting Savannah Fund, Alliy, an electrical and communications engineer and Stanford MBA graduate, worked as a software and aerospace systems engineer for several technology companies in Silicon Valley and the United Kingdom, including Microsoft and the UK\u2019s Defense Evaluation Research Agency.\n\nHe cut his teeth as an investor while working as an associate at i/o Ventures, an early-stage seed fund. He helped source deals, incubate startups, and provide strategic directions for the venture\u2019s portfolio companies.\n\nHis experience at these organisations allowed him to observe developments in Africa\u2019s tech industry. This opportunity showed him the difficulty founders face in getting early-stage capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether with Paul Bragiel, Savannah Fund\u2019s General Partner and a partner at i/o Ventures, he started the firm in 2012. Initially an accelerator, the firm hosted startup cohorts for three months, culminating in a $30,000 investment. In 2016, it fully transitioned to a VC firm supporting early-stage startups.\n\nWhat the firm looks for in startups\n\nSavannah Fund invests between $100,000 and $250,000 in startups, and Alliy shares what they like to see in the founders they back. The first requirement is having at least one technical solid co-founder on the team. With both partners having technical backgrounds, this does not come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, the best startups have strong engineering teams. Aerobotics and Smile Identity (portfolio companies) have strong engineering teams. We are seeing more and more startups that could work without a technical CTO, but that is something that we like.\u201d\n\nThe market size the startup is pursuing is another factor the firm considers. \u201cWe like to go after frontier markets where there\u2019s not much going on. That\u2019s why I like Ethiopia right now. It\u2019s quite disconnected from the rest of Africa, and with a hundred million people, it\u2019s a big market.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a big market, the firm also favours startups with the potential to scale across Africa and go global. Two of the companies in its portfolio \u2013 Aerobotics and FlexClub \u2013 have expanded outside Africa; the former operates in the United States while the latter has launched in Mexico.\n\nIn March, the firm brought the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Women\u2019s Finance Initiative (WeFi) on board as investors in their second fund. This has affected the firm\u2019s investment policy, emphasising female founders/teams and issues around environmental, social, and governance (ESG).\n\nAlliy discloses that about 46% of the startups in their portfolio have at least one female founder or a female CEO. In addition, he encourages startups in their portfolio, especially those in the logistics sector, to adopt sustainable practices. Governance is another area the firm takes seriously, but he cautions that timing is crucial in instituting corporate governance.\n\nMore than money\n\nA major effect of the success enjoyed by African startups is that more investors are itching to get a piece of the pie. However, this also means that founders need strategic partners who bring more than money to the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavannah Fund is well-placed to offer founders a lot more than money. Alliy and Bragiel have extensive contacts in the US, having worked there previously. Also, Bragiel is a partner at Golden Gate Ventures, a Singaporean VC firm that has invested in startups like Stripe and AngelList.\n\nPortfolio companies and failures\n\nSome of the startups in Savannah Fund\u2019s portfolio include lending startup, Lidya, identity management startup, Smile Identity, eCommerce startup, Supermart.ng, logistics startup, Sendy, Ugandan gaming company, Kola Studios, and edtech startup, Eneza Education. So far, none of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies has failed.\n\nHowever, Alliy reveals that most of the startups from the firm\u2019s accelerator days failed.\n\nPitfalls for startups to avoid\n\nAlliy believes that focus is vital for startups, especially at the early stages when they may not have as much freedom to experiment. \u201cI see too many startups trying to do too much, too quickly, too early. A focus on the next step is very important.\u201d\n\nHe also advises that founders build to solve problems they care about and not for investors.\n\nWhile speaking with Alliy, his pride in those who work or have worked with him is evident. One such person is Malaika Judd, Co-Founder and CFO at Sendy, a logistics platform. Before joining Sendy, she was a mentor at Savannah Fund, leading the firm\u2019s investment in Nigerian logistics company, African Courier Express (ACE).\n\nDespite being Tanzanian, Savannah Fund has not funded any Tanzanian startup; Alliy hopes to change this soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not made any investments in Tanzania because the previous governments have not been friendly towards startups. Hopefully, that changes soon. Investing in a Tanzanian startup would be my proudest moment,\u201d he remarks with a laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The report is in line with Techpoint Africa\u2018s mission of democratising the African technology narrative\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint \u2014 the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa \u2014 has since released 12 editions of NSFR and the West African Startup Decade Report (WASDR) within the last three and a half years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this moment, only the first three editions of NSFR were available for free but after rethinking the ultimate vision of Techpoint \u2014 becoming the information warehouse for everything startups, technology, and innovation on the continent, we have decided to make all our reports available for free, starting with the WASDR and NSFR Q1 2021.\n\nFor believing in the Intelligence by Techpoint dream\n\nI\u2019d like to use this opportunity to once again appreciate brands and individuals that have believed in the Intelligence by Techpoint dream.\n\nFuture Hub and SUNRYSE believed in the dream enough to work with us in translating WASDR to Mandarin and Japanese editions respectively. They also played a major role in the campaign and marketing of the report alongside the likes of Statista, Crunchbase, and Maxime Bayen.\n\nThe WASDR is our most expensive report to date but people still believed in our work enough to make a purchase. These people are getting part of the credit for making the decade report available for free. Some of them who accepted to be mentioned are Odunayo Eweniyi (co-founder, PiggyVest and FirstCheck Africa), and Salient Advisory.\n\nOn the part of NSFR, we have subscribers of the paid editions in three digits: it would have been nice to mention you all but that would be a very long list.\n\nBeyond making all our past reports available for free, most (if not all) of our subsequent reports will also be available for free as well. And we will be working with brands, as sponsors, to make them available for free. A couple of these are already in the works and would be released before the year runs out.\n\nTo every brand and person mentioned above (and those not mentioned), we say thank you for believing in the Techpoint Africa dream once again. Do note that this decision doesn\u2019t imply that we are abandoning the Intelligence by Techpoint dream. The only change is that we will be releasing only a single annual edition of the Nigerian Startup Funding Report.\n\nMeanwhile, we will keep our subscribers up-to-date on funding activities in the country, and Africa by extension, as well as other relevant activities, through our monthly newsletter that was started earlier in the year.

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nLab testing at your doorstep\n\nKlasha\u2019s Ghanaian expansion\n\nSudan\u2019s first tech investment in over 25 years\n\nHealthtracka wants to bring lab testing to your doorstep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson & Victor Amusan, Healthtracka Co-founders\n\nThe death of a loved one is often a life-changing event. While it drives some to despair, others are inspired to create solutions that ensure a better survival rate for more people.\n\nIfeoluwa Dare-Johnson falls into the second category. She started healthtech startup, Healthtracka, following the avoidable death of her father from several illnesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Healthtracka does: Easing the process of conducting laboratory tests, the startup allows people to get tested without leaving their homes or offices.\n\nHow does this work? Phlebotomists visit the patient at home or the office where they take samples required for the test. These samples are then sent to laboratories where the tests are carried out and results sent to patients via email.\n\nAt what cost: The average pricing for a test costs \u20a615,000 ($37). While this may be expensive for most Nigerians, if you live in Lagos, Nigeria \u2014 where the startup launched \u2014 this might be a small price to pay for the inconvenience that comes with leaving your house.\n\nDare-Johnson, however, hopes that they can carry out tests at cheaper costs as Healthtracka grows.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, no more spoilers; here\u2019s a link to the full story on our website. Also, while you\u2019re here, please share this newsletter with anyone you know.\n\nKlasha launches in Ghana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Klasha\u2019s Founder\n\nCross-border payment startup, Klasha, has launched in Ghana. Last week, the startup announced its $2.4 million seed investment led by Greycroft. At the time, the startup hinted at possible expansion plans into three African countries.\n\nWith this announcement, Ghana opens the floor, with two more coming soon.\n\nJessica Anuna, CEO of Klasha, believes that its expansion into Ghana will make it easier for residents of the West African country to shop online. \u201cBefore now, international online and offline businesses faced the challenge of accepting online payments from Africa and even delivering items to Ghana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur solution will simplify the process, removing payment and last-mile delivery barriers, making it easier and faster for retailers to collect online payments in Ghana, manage payouts and expand seamlessly.\u201d\n\nThe Ghana expansion also comes with more functionalities for users, with the ability to send and receive money between Ghana and Nigeria. And access to a multi-currency wallet, giving them the option to hold, exchange, and send money in different currencies at the best rate for free.\n\nSudan gets its first foreign investment in over 25 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarneem Nina Saeed, CEO of alsoug. Source: Technext\n\nSome news from Sudan. Yes, Sudan. Egyptian payments company, Fawry has announced its investment in alsoug, Sudan\u2019s largest online classifieds marketplace, to help build out the latter\u2019s new fintech platform, Cashi.\n\nThis is part of a $5 million investment in alsoug by Fawry and other investors and is symbolic as it marks the first foreign funding in Sudan in over 25 years.\n\nWhat does alsoug do? The company allows Sudanese consumers to buy and sell products and services, including real estate, furniture, and electronics. The platform reportedly has had nearly two million app downloads since its launch in 2016.\n\nFawry CEO, Eng. Ashraf Sabry said, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be kicking off our partnership with alsoug, one of Sudan\u2019s most exciting prospects and a Sudanese leader in tech innovation. This is our first investment foray outside of Egypt in our thirteen years of operation, and we\u2019re confident that our story with alsoug and Cashi will be a special one.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? After being isolated for over 25 years, the investment into alsoug could prove to be a watershed moment in Sudan\u2019s startup space, coming at a time when there is increased interest in African startups.

          "title": "Here\u2019s why Nigerians may pay more for cooking gas in festive period",
          "text": "Here\u2019s why Nigerians may pay more for cooking gas in festive period\n\nWith the festive season less than six weeks away, there are indications the soaring cost of cooking gas may extend beyond December 2021, a development that will compound what has been a terrible year for Nigerians\u2019 disposable income.\n\nA combination of supply shortfall, re-introduction of VAT, foreign exchange scarcity/naira devaluation, logistic hitches among others, are some of the reasons experts gave for Nigeria\u2019s current inability to meet local gas demands.\n\nThese reasons have led to an 87percent increase in the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) popularly called cooking gas as prices of 12.5kg cylinder has risen from N4, 000 in January to about N7, 500 in Lagos and Ogun States, depending on locations.\n\nOther experts fear LPG\u2019s price may jump to N10, 000 before the yuletide season unless urgent steps are taken to increase local production and improve supply to the market.\n\nAs the yuletide season approaches, here are four reasons why Nigerians may pay more for cooking gas.\n\nSupply shortfall\n\nNigeria has one of the world\u2019s largest reserves of natural gas estimated at about 600 trillion cubic feet, which has made it to be the sixth-largest gas country globally as well as the ninth-ranked country in terms of gas export. Yet meeting local demands remains a major challenge.\n\n\u201cEarly in the year a 20-metric ton of gas was selling for below N5 million but today, the same tonnage sells for N10.2 million. As long as there is that supply shortage, the available quantity and the dynamics of supply-demand will keep pushing the price higher,\u201d Bassey Essien, the executive secretary of the National Association of LPG Marketers said at an event.\n\nThe marketers union warned that the 12.5kg cylinder of cooking gas, which currently sells between N7,500 and N8,000 could rise to N10,000 by December if the government fails to address the crisis.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s poor feel pain of soaring price of cooking gas\n\nHe also lamented that more Nigerians were being forced to return to kerosene, firewood, charcoal, and sawdust due to the sudden rise in the price of cooking gas.\n\nRe-introduction of VAT\n\nThree months ago, the Federal Government reintroduced the 7.5 percent VAT on imported LPG in a bid to boost its revenue sources, following evident pressures through the year.\n\nThe government had in 2019 gazetted the removal of VAT on cooking gas, as a product to increase its domestic utilization.\n\nHowever, the director of Depart of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Sarki Auwalu, had said the government had to re-impose VAT on imported LPG to attract investments to local gas production.\n\nInvestigation in the market shows that the price of cooking gas in Nigeria has been on an upward swing since the reimposition of VAT, with the price of LPG skyrocketing to N7,500 in October for 12.5 kilograms of LPG.\n\nForeign exchange scarcity/naira devaluation\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s findings also revealed naira devaluation and foreign exchange scarcity, to a great extent, have adversely affected LPG pricing, which is denominated in dollars.\n\nAccording to Muda Yusuf, the immediate past director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), the country\u2019s high dependence on importation of LPG plays a major role in the latest price hike of LPG.\n\nHe noted that as long as the dollar was appreciating against the naira, the price of cooking gas would keep increasing.\n\nPresently, the official exchange rate of a dollar to the naira is N410.87. The rate is also within the range of N570 \u2013 N572 at the parallel market.\n\nIn May, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) devalued the naira by 7.6 percent in an attempt to migrate towards a single exchange rate system.\n\nThe CBN replaced the fixed official rate of N379 to a dollar and adopted the more flexible NAFEX exchange rate of N410.25 per dollar.\n\nLogistics hitches\n\nFindings by BusinessDay further showed the inability of energy marketers to off-take 450,000 metric tons per annum (MTPA), of product allocated, is another major factor responsible for the supply shortages.\n\nNigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) marketing manager, Austin Ogbogbo, told journalists recently, that because of certain logistics, only about 375,000mt of the company\u2019s dedicated 450,000mt LPG supply was being taken by the domestic market.\n\nThe factors, according to him, had to do with delay of the company\u2019s LPG vessel at the Apapa Port, preference of white products for LPG by the terminal owners, and insufficient coastal storage facilities.\n\nHe said if those logistical challenges were solved, the company would supply 100 percent of its LPG production to the domestic market.\n\n\u201cWe could go up 100 percent if coastal storage is available. Sometimes, you want to supply, LPG takes the backstage. They prefer white products in the coastal storage, or if it\u2019s not white products, your vessel might be there for days, accumulating demurrage.\n\n\u201cImmediately that is cleared and we are sure we can come in and supply, we will push that in, and hopefully, we will ramp up to the 100 percent,\u201d Ogbogbo said.",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has increased Nigeria\u2019s growth forecast for this year to 2.6 percent from an earlier prediction of 2.5 percent amid the rally in oil prices, but analysts say the improved growth will not bring relief to people in the world\u2019s poverty capital.\n\nThe growth revision was made in the IMF\u2019s October 2021 World Economic Outlook Report, which was released Tuesday.\n\nThe projection for 2022 was also raised to 2.7 per cent from 2.6 percent.\n\nThe improved outlook for the economy is a result of the rally in oil prices which is currently trading at a 7yr high at over $80 per barrel. A barrel of Brent Crude sold for $83 Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data, as oil races towards $90 per barrel on the back of an energy crunch.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s top exporter of the commodity is expected to reap some benefits from the rally, according to the IMF, even though the benefit is muted as it has only translated to a 0.1 percent points upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade however comes at a time when the Washington-based lender has downgraded global growth projections for 2021 due to the adverse impact of supply chain disruptions on advanced economies even as the lack of access to Covid-19 vaccines holds back prospects for the emerging economies.\n\n\u201cPartially offsetting these changes, projections for some commodity exporters have been upgraded on the back of rising commodity prices,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the Economic Counsellor/Director of Research, IMF said.\n\nRead Also: IMF upgrades Nigeria\u2019s GDP growth on oil price rally\n\n\u201cPandemic-related disruptions to contact-intensive sectors have caused the labour market recovery to significantly lag the output recovery in most countries,\u201d Gopinath added.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s growth outlook for Nigeria is more optimistic than the World Bank\u2019s 2.4 percent estimate but lower than the government\u2019s 3 percent target.\n\nNigerian analysts see the IMF\u2019s projection as achievable considering the gradual economic recovery and the ongoing vaccination exercise in the country but said it would still be unable to reduce poverty in a country that is home to the highest number of poor people globally.\n\n\u201cIt is a slight improvement over July 2021 growth forecast but still below the country\u2019s population growth rate and below the growth potential of the country which means it brings no relief for rising poverty levels,\u201d said Ayodele Akinwunmi, relationship manager, corporate banking at FSDH Merchant Bank Limited.\n\nAkinwunmi said it meant more policies were required to unlock the growth potential of the country in order to achieve sustainable growth that is inclusive and able to reduce poverty.\n\nNigeria\u2019s real GDP Year-on-Year real expanded by 5 percent in the second quarter (Q2) of 2021, the highest since 2014.\n\nBut it was due to the base effect following the implementation of lockdown and restrictions in Q2 2020.\n\n\u201cThe deeper an economy contracted in 2020Q2, the higher it will grow in 2021Q2,\u201d said Doyin Salami, Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee on the Economy.\n\n\u201cIn the third and fourth quarters of 2021, the base effect is expected to fade out. Hence, growth will be lower,\u201d Salami said.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham also said the IMF\u2019s projection is achievable given the increase in business activities so far this year.\n\nAdditionally, he said the impact of COVID has been minimal on the economy and vaccination is progressing albeit at a slow pace.\n\nElsewhere, the global growth projection for 2021 was downgraded by 0.1 percentage points to 5.9 per cent, while the global growth forecast for 2022 remained unchanged at 4.9 per cent.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s Gopinath said \u201cPandemic outbreaks in critical links of global supply chains have resulted in longer-than-expected supply disruptions, further feeding inflation in many countries. Overall, risks to economic prospects have increased, and policy trade-offs have become more complex,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "After cleaning her teary eyes, Jenifer Abbas arranged more firewood to intensify the flame under her pot. She looked tired and sick, but could not quit her business. She has run the food business for over 25 years, alternating between firewood and cooking gas.\n\nAbbas, who resides in Sabongida village, a community close to Nigeria\u2019s federal capital, battles chest pain and cough. She told BusinessDay that the incessant increase in the price of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) also called cooking gas, has made life more difficult for her.\n\n\u201cI alternate between cooking gas and firewood because I have to factor my children\u2019s school fees into the business. The current rising price of cooking gas won\u2019t allow me to consider it as an option,\u201d Abbas said.\n\nShe added, \u201cThe little I make from my rice and beans sales are channelled into different responsibilities. With N200 firewood, I will prepare food for my customers for two days and make little money for the needs of my children.\u201d\n\nEunice Okon, a fruit seller and resident of Lagos State described as worrisome, the rising cost of cooking gas, which she said had made many go back to use of coal and firewood because kerosene was also expensive.\n\nAccording to Okon, it\u2019s becoming cheaper to cook with charcoal at N200 per bucket of paint than buying 3kg of cooking gas at N2,000 or 12.5kg at N7,500, excluding transportation.\n\n\u201cWith the way things are going, the cost of gas may rise to N1, 000 per kilogram by end of the year,\u201d she predicted.\n\nRead Also: Nigerians to expect further rise in cost of cooking gas as problem persists\n\nAina Babatunde, a taxi driver, said he abandoned his gas cooker for a charcoal stove. \u201cMany of us can\u2019t buy cooking gas anymore; the government should do something about it. The price keeps increasing every day.\u2019\u2019\n\nBusinessDay findings revealed that the price of LPG has increased five times in the last two months.\n\nFindings further showed that a 12.5kg cooking gas cylinder was sold in Lagos for N3,800 in October 2020; N4,500 in June and July 2021; N6,000 in September, and now N7,500 in Lagos and Ogun States, depending on locations.\n\nMajor fear among consumers and stakeholders is that the price may jump to N10, 000 soonest unless urgent steps are taken to increase local production and improve supply to the market.\n\nExperts blamed the price hike of LPG on the dearth of infrastructure, global shortfall in gas supply, inadequate local production, shortage of foreign exchange (Forex), devaluation of naira and logistic hitches.\n\n\u201cThe government need to review the recently introduced import charges and value-added tax (VAT), else the price of cooking gas may as well reach N10,000 for a 12.5kg cylinder,\u201d Bassey Essien, the executive secretary of Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) said at weekly e-discourse organised by a Platforms Africa.\n\nRecall that in September, oil marketers under the aegis of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), protested the Federal Government\u2019s reintroduction of VAT on imported LPG.\n\nThey argued that the introduction of VAT to the already high price of gas which is largely imported due to the global gas crisis will negate the government\u2019s policy on the adoption of LPG.\n\nMembers of the association who are major stakeholders in the downstream sector of the oil industry asked the Federal Government to rescind its decision by removing the 7.5 percent VAT on the product, warning that the fee will hamper the adoption of gas in the country and create a barrier to the objectives of the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 agenda of the government.\n\n\u201cWe are also meeting with the marketers via moral suasion not to capitalise on the situation to inflict more pain on citizens by increasing the price of gas in their locations, though they are equally incurring a huge cost to have cooking gas at their locations,\u201d Essien said at the event.\n\nThe NALPGAM executive secretary also decried the gradual rise in the cost of cylinders over the years, maintaining that all the raw materials used by the two cylinder manufacturing plants in the country are imported.\n\nHe said despite Nigeria\u2019s over 200 million population, the country can hardly boost of 10 million cylinders in circulation, most of which are even substandard, a development that is forcing more households to other means of cooking.\n\nMost health experts say those cooking with firewood and charcoal are likely to develop Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a condition that makes breathing difficult. Also, children around the vicinity are particularly at risk of asthma.\n\nIn 2018, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said \u201ceach year, close to four million people die prematurely from illness attributable to household air pollution from inefficient cooking practices using polluting stoves paired with solid fuels.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also said that non-communicable diseases caused by firewood often lead to premature deaths due to stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.\n\nIn another report, WHO says smoke emanating from firewood used for cooking is the third greatest killer of women and children in Nigeria as no fewer than 98,000 Nigerian women die annually from smoke inhaled during cooking with firewood.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nOfficials of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank, Debt Management Office (DMO), Budget Office, among others, today, staged Eurobond Roadshow in New York, United States.\n\nThe Roadshow was led by DMO DG, Ms. Patience Oniha, and had in attendance are DG Budget Office, Mr Ben Akabueze and the Central Bank Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele.\n\nNigeria had last month, raised $4 billion through Eurobonds, an amount that was raised after an intensive two days of virtual meetings with investors across the globe.\n\nThe DMO had in a statement explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.\n\n\u201cThis exceptional performance has been described as, \u2018one of the biggest financial trades to come out of Africa in 2021\u2019 and \u2018an excellent outcome,\u201d the DMO had said.\n\nBids for the Eurobonds were received from investors in Europe and America, as well as Asia, even as there was good participation by local investors.\n\nThe DMO had noted that the size of the Order Book and the quality of investors demonstrates confidence in Nigeria.\n\nThe Eurobonds were issued in three tranches, details, namely seven years\u2013,$1.25 billion at 6.125 per cent per annum; 12 years -$1.5 billion at 7.375 per cent per annum as well as 30 years -$1.25 billion at 8.25 per annum.\n\nThe long tenors of the Eurobonds and the spread across different maturities are well aligned with Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy, 2020 \u20132023, the DMO said.\n\nIt stressed that since the Eurobonds were issued as part of the New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the raising of $4 billion through Eurobonds provides a significant amount of funds to finance projects in the Act, thus contributing to the implementation of the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nNigeria returned to the International Capital Market (ICM) three years after its last outing in 2018, when it floated a $2.5 billion aggregate Eurobonds under its Global Medium Term Note Programme.\n\nThe DMO had stated that in addition to providing funding to part-finance the deficit in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the issuance of the Eurobonds would benefits the country in many other strategic ways.\n\nAccording to the DMO, it would also bring about an inflow of foreign exchange, leading to an increase in external reserves to help support the naira exchange rate as well as Nigeria\u2019s sovereign rating.\n\nIt further explained that when Nigeria raised funds externally through Eurobonds, it freed up space in the domestic market for private sector and sub-national borrowers.\n\nThe debt management body stated, \u201cIn effect, it helps the sovereign not to crowd out other borrowers in the domestic market. The issuance of Eurobonds by Nigeria has opened up opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s corporate sector, notably banks, to issue Eurobonds to raise capital in the ICM.\u201d",

Paschal Oluchukwu, gave Ebonyi State government 24 hours ultimatum to release the said journalist from detention and apologise to him for violation of his fundamental human rights.\n\n\u201cWe at the Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora, (AESID) received with stern reservations and downright condemnation, the assent recently given to a so-termed controversial; Cybercrime Prohibition Law Number 012 2021 by the Governor and Chief Executive of the State, Engr. David Nweze Umahi.\n\n\u201cThe said law which we believe must have been surreptitiously signed into law without the traditional public debates especially at the legislative arm and involving the people\u2019s inputs claims it genuinely wants to fight and stamp fake news spread through the use of Social media out of our dear State,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group alleged that the law, which was only assented reportedly on September 27, 2021, was already being tested, amidst public outcry on a journalist and On-Air-Personality, Chikwere, whom the Umahi government accused of making \u2018offensive\u2019 posts against the provisions of the law on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cAs a leading governance and accountability platform, we have taken time to read through the Facebook posts made by the victim, Mr. Chikwere and we are sincerely at a loss just like virtually every other Social media users on how a mere post counseling youths to be careful with politicians who would engage them to kill and maim fellow youths became offensive to the said law?\n\n\u201cWhat exactly is the contravention in a post that never mentioned, abused or incited anyone either against individuals or the government? We are even further disturbed watching the Commissioner mention another post also made by the victim claiming that the Nigerian Army must have lost public respect following its arrest and detention of popular Nollywood Actor, Chinwetalu Agu who was picked up at the Upper Iweka area of Onitsha, Anambra State for adorning a dress with the customary rising sun logo. We ask; Assuming without even conceding that the army was assaulted or libeled, when did it cede the powers to restore its image on the Ebonyi State government or empowered them to act on its behalf?\n\n\u201cAESID, therefore, wish to ask certain pertinent questions regarding the hurried disposition of the government to enforce the said law. One; Was there any public debate before the Ebonyi State House of Assembly to enable the masses make submissions before this law was passed and assented to by the governor?\n\n\u201cTwo, as guaranteed in a constitutional democracy, did the House of Assembly ever call for a memoranda from members of the public to keep them informed, aware and participatory in the entire process of enacting the said anti-social media law?\n\n\u201cThirdly, knowing how sensitive and controversial any regulatory law on the use of Social media is, is the government not merely targeting opposition elements particularly in the PDP as has been the case since the defection of the Governor to the ruling APC?,\u201d Oluchukwu queried.\n\nWhile calling for the immediate and unconditional release within 24 hours of the journalist, \u201cwhom we understand is now lying critically ill in the hospital following his arrest and detention by the Police over the last weekend,\u201d the group also demanded that the journalist should be compensated with apology.\n\n\u201cAESID demands that Governor Umahi should in the same vein withdraw the said hasty assent he gave to this rather draconian law that should have no place in a democratic regime like ours.\n\n\u201cThe law, which we believe is against the spirits and letters of Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Freedom of Information Act effectively operational in our nation should have no place at all in a young and developing State like Ebonyi which is earnestly yearning for a marketplace of ideas to grow and level up with its contemporaries and competing neighbours.\n\n\u201cBut for the fact that Umahi, in his outright dictatorial tendencies and overwhelming greed has not only \u2018stolen\u2019 enough from our public treasury but afraid of any form of dissenting opinion, there is no other reason we can blame for this secret promulgation of an utterly senseless \u2018decree\u2019 in a democracy to gag the Social media.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty as always therefore to call the State government and their agents to order not to continue to ridicule our beloved State which anti-progressive laws and actions that are not in conformity with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which Ebonyi is part of.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEbonyi is not an Umahi Republic and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), proclaims its supremacy in section 1 (1), in the following words: \u2018This Constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria\u2019 and Section 1 (3) then goes on to state most unambiguously that \u2018If any other law is inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution, this Constitution shall prevail and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void,\u201d they argued.\n\nThe group said it was deeply saddened by the developments in the state and cautioned the Umahi administration \u201cto stop further embarrassments and ridicule of our young state as the images of all reasonable and hardworking Ebonyians all over the globe are affected by their actions, and even inactions.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) has faulted the state governor, David Umahi, for implementing Cybercrime Prohibition Law in the state without a public hearing.\nThe group also demanded the immediate release of a Radio presenter, Godfrey Chikwere, arrested and detained over a Facebook post on the order of the state government.\nPaschal Oluchukwu, gave Ebonyi State government 24 hours ultimatum to release the said journalist from detention and apologise to him for violation of his fundamental human rights.\nWe ask; Assuming without even conceding that the army was assaulted or libeled, when did it cede the powers to restore its image on the Ebonyi State government or empowered them to act on its behalf?\nOne; Was there any public debate before the Ebonyi State House of Assembly to enable the masses make submissions before this law was passed and assented to by the governor?",

Hope Uzodimma of Imo and Governor Mai Mala Buni at the State House, Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement issued in Awka by Mr Tex Okechukwu, APGA National Publicity Secretary, the party said the defection was long expected.\n\nAccording to APGA, the deputy governor had thought that the governor and the party were going to hand over the governorship ticket of the party to him on a platter.\n\n\u201cWhen that didn\u2019t happen, he started behaving abnormally, even to the point of insubordination and dereliction of duties,\u201d it claimed.\n\nAPGA said the deputy governor left the party without formally notifying the party or the state governor, adding that the move was uncalled for, ill-timed and ill-advised.\n\nAccording to the statement, the governor had always treated his deputy with respect, love and consideration.\n\nAPGA called on party members to remain united and ensure victory in the Nov. 6 governorship election.\n\nIt called on Gov. Willie Obiano not to be distracted by the defection of his deputy, which it claimed was a ploy to create a semblance of disunity in his government.\n\n\u201cLet nobody be deceived, APC has no root anywhere in Anambra and that is why all that they do is going about luring political deadwood with money and other lucres.\n\n\u201cNo matter the designs of the opposition and other subterranean forces, APGA is poised to win the forthcoming election and continue with the massive infrastructural development going on in the state.\u201d\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodinma who briefed State House correspondents after the new APC member was presented to the President said there will be more defections to the APC before the November 6 governorship election.\n\nThe governor faulted that claims by APGA and Governor Willie Obiano that members of the State House of Assembly who defected from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) were financially induced to join the APC.\n\nHe said on the contrary, the defectors were lobbied through persuasion and counselling.",

          "text": "By Abbas Bamalli/Kankara\n\nKankara, the local council of Katsina state where more than 300 students were kidnapped by terrorists in December 2020, is facing a crisis of out-of-school children.\n\nA report just released has indicated that 75 per cent of children in the council area drop out of school upon completing primary school.\n\nAlhaji Isa Muhammad, Secretary of the Katsina state Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), disclosed this on Wednesday, while quoting the report of a survey conducted by UNICEF.\n\nThe occasion was the launch of the back-to-school and dissemination of behavioural campaign in Kankara.\n\nThe programme, which was launched on Tuesday, in Katsina, is being implemented, in collaboration with UNICEF and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the UK.\n\nMuhammed said that the data had revealed that only 82 per cent of children aged between 6 and 11 attend primary school, while 28 per cent were out of primary school.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 25 per cent of the children between the ages of 12 to 14, were those in Secondary schools, and 75 per cent are out-of-school.\n\n\u201cThus, this signifies that the majority of the children that attend primary school do not transit to Junior Secondary School (JSS), as they drop-out at the primary level.\n\n\u201cKatsina state is one of the identified states in the northern parts of the country with a significant number of out of school children, with children within the 6-14 age bracket having a higher percentage.\n\n\u201cThe figures are alarming, with Kankara among the leading LGAs in the state. And access to secondary Schools is challenging.\n\n\u201cIn Kankara, which has an area of 1,462 square kms in size, some students trek more than five kms from their communities to the nearest secondary school.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the lack of Secondary schools in some communities in Kankara, mostly stopped pupils transiting from primary to JSS level.\u201d Muhammed said.\n\nHe explained that the state government and other development partners had achieved a lot in terms of ensuring that school age children were in school, retained, complete, as well as transit to a higher level.\n\nAccording to him, transition is one of the challenges that had contributed to the out-of-school-children in the LGA.\n\nHe said as pupils complete the cycle, they were unable to transit to higher levels.\n\n\u201cThis is alarming and need immediate attention or a state of emergency on education in Kankara, so as to propel avenues and activities, as well as implementing them to overcome the challenge.\n\nThe Head of Administration, Kankara Local Government Council, Alhaji Nura Labaran said the high number of out-of-school-children in the area was 95 per cent caused by insecurity.\n\nThree per cent of the cause could be attributed to inadequate learning structures and materials, while the rest two per cent were due to human lapses.\n\nWhile commending the development partners, Labaran assured of the LG administration\u2019s support to the success of the exercise.",

At the same time, roughly 96 per cent of the population in low-income countries have yet to receive a single COVID jab,\u201d the IMF noted.\n\nThe recovery gap between richer and poorer countries is expected to widen, with the IMF calling for advanced economies to regain their pre-pandemic trend path next year and exceed it by 0.9 per cent in 2024.\n\nBy contrast, the fund predicted economic growth in emerging and developing economies \u2013 minus China \u2013 would remain 5.5 per cent below pre-pandemic forecasts in 2024, \u201cresulting in a larger setback to improvements in their living standards.\u201d\n\nWhile the IMF saw inflation reverting to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of next year, a more granular analysis reveals a wide disparity in the outlook between nations.\n\nFor advanced economies, the fund believed headline inflation would peak in the final months of this year and decline to about two per cent by mid-2022.\n\nFor emerging market and developing economies, headline inflation is expected to peak at 6.8 per cent later this year before falling to about four per cent by the middle of next year \u201cwith risks tilted to the upside over the medium term.\u201d",

These MDAs failed to appear. These MDAs failed to appear.\n\n\u201cThe Senate considers this attitude as a sabotage to the effort of the federal government to secure the loans and fund the infrastructure development that this country desperately needs.\n\nAlready, the National Assembly has approved the loan requests but there is need for clarifications by the affected agencies.\n\n\u201cI will therefore call the names of these MDAs, and we are giving them just one week to appear before the Committee on Loan and Foreign Debts.

Statistics generated over the last four weeks on testing have shown that the trend of infection is going down in some states while in others, the trajectory is upward. The combined total for testing by PCR and RDT now stands at about 3.141, 795 million persons.\n\n4. The aviation authorities in collaboration with the diplomatic sector have made reasonable progress in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Discussions are still ongoing with the UAE authorities to resolve the impasse.\n\nThe Hon Minister of Aviation today, presented the position of African countries on Vaccine Passport which some economic blocks and countries wish to impose, for travel purposes. This is because African countries have found it difficult to access the vaccines for their citizens in sufficient numbers.\n\n5. Over several months, four countries were placed on high-level restrictions for travellers from such countries. The PSC has after a review of the developments in these countries, decided to remove South Africa, Turkey, and Brazil from the restricted list.\n\n6. As you are aware, the UK has eased restrictions on fully vaccinated travellers from Nigeria to the UK with effect from 11th October. Nigeria welcomes this development and assures that the PSC shall continue to review Nigeria\u2019s protocols based on global developments, science and national experience. A revised protocol will be issued in the next 24 hours.\n\n7. With effect from 1st December 2021, Federal Government employees shall be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result done within 72 hours, to gain access to their offices, in all locations within Nigeria and our Missions. An appropriate service-wide advisory/circular will be issued to guide the process.\n\n8. The PSC wishes to put Nigerians on notice that two major religious festivities (Salah and Christmas) are approaching and we shall be experiencing increased passenger traffic in and out of the country. Similarly, events of large gatherings are likely to hold. While the PSC prepares to escalate surveillance and other control activities, we urge the States and all Nigerians to also increase their vigilance and take measures to moderate activities.\n\n9. I thank you for your patience. The PSC shall be elaborating on all these at our next regular briefing.",

          "text": "Justice Daniel Osiagor of a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos on Wednesday has imposed a fine of N200,000:00 on a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani Kayode, for his absence, to take his fresh plea on an alleged N4.6 billion fraud.\n\nMr Fani-kayode is being prosecuted before the court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) along with a former Minister of Finance, Nenadi Esther Usman, and a former chairman of the Association of Local Governments Of Nigeria, Danjuma Yusuf, as well as a company, Jointrust Dimentions Nigeria Limited.\n\nTheir trial had initially commenced in 2016, before Justice Muslim Hassan, who has now been elevated to the Court of Appeal.\n\nBut midway in their trial, the defendants\u2019 case file was transferred to Justice Rilwan Aikawa, on the ground that Justice Hassan, was formerly a legal officer with the EFCC, as the defendants\u2019 had alleged that the judge could be biased in the case.\n\nAnother plea was then taken before the second judge, Justice Aikawa. But, the case file was again transferred to a third judge, Justice Osiagor, for the matter to start afresh, as Justice Aikawa was transfered to the Akure division of the court.\n\nAt the resumed hearing of the matter in Wednesday, the prosecutor, Bilikisu Buhari, applied for the bail initially granted Femi Fani-kayode to be revoked, as he was not in court to take his plea before Justice Osiagor.\n\nBut, Mr Fani-kayode\u2019s counsel, F. B. Ajudua, pleaded with the court not to revoke his bail, saying that a letter has been written on behalf of his client, the he is currently on \u2018bed rest\u2019, at Kubwa General Hospital, Abuja.\n\nHe also told the court that his client has been readily attending his trial since the matter commenced in 2016, and that today is the only day that he was not in court.\n\nThe trial judge, upon perusing the Court\u2019s records, discovered that the defendant in question had been absent from previous sittings for five times, and noted that this stalled the smooth hearing of the charge.\n\nJustice Osiagor, gave the defense counsel two options of either to revoke the bail or opt for a fine of N200, 000:00.\n\nUpon choosing the latter, the judge ordered that the fine must be paid before the next sitting, and adjourned till November 30, for all the defendants\u2019 rearraignment.\n\nThe EFCC in the charge marked FHC/L/C/251c/2016, alleged that Mrs Usman, a former Minister of Finance, under president Goodluck Jonathan Administration, Femi Fani-kayode, who was the chief media adviser in the Goodluck Jonathan Presidential Campaign Organization, as well as Danjuma Yusuf and Jointrust Dimentions, had on or before January 2015, unlawfully retained the total sum of N4. 6 billion, which they knew to have been proceeds from an unlawful act.\n\nWhile the former State Minister for Finance, Danjuma Yusuf and Jointrust Dimentions Nigeria Limited retained the sum of N1.5 billion, Femi Fani-kayode and one Olubode Oke, said to be at large, were alleged to have retained the total sum of N1,650,650 billion.\n\nThe accused persons were also alleged to have made payment of several amounts running to billions on Naira without going through Financial institutions.",

He\u2019s the show\u2019s main character.\n\nChloe says the drama also gives viewers a different perception of South Korea.\n\n\u201cPeople in general think of South Korea as a big flash country with a lot of rich people, so it\u2019s nice to see the other side that is not really spoken about, like the struggle and poverty.\u201d\n\nKorean influence has grown massively in the UK.\n\nPeople here Googled Korea-related topics in October more than ever before, according to Google Trends data, and last month the Oxford English Dictionary added 26 new words of Korean origin to its latest edition to ride \u201cthe crest of the Korean wave\u201d.\n\nAs in the Oscar-winning Korean film, Parasite, the hardship seen in Squid Game is what makes it appealing to an international audience, says Dr Hye-Kyung Lee \u2013 who\u2019s researching the rise of K-drama and K-pop at King\u2019s College London.\n\n\u201cThese dramas or films are entertaining, and they have something unique which can strike a chord with people around the world.\n\n\u201cThey present a critique of society and social-economic conditions, which people can relate to through the characters.\u201d\n\nDr Lee says other Korean dramas do touch on issues of society, economy and politics, but Squid Game has been far more direct in its approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s serious, the message is extreme and I think that reflects what\u2019s happening right now.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s something Chloe agrees with.\n\n\u201cOther Korean shows can be quite modest, they don\u2019t show blood, nudity and they blur out weapons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able see things and be unexpected.\u201d\n\nBBC",

It also found \u201cno compelling evidence that Somalia has acquiesced\u201d to Kenya\u2019s claim of a maritime boundary along a parallel line of latitude.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Malcolm Webb reporting from Nairobi, Kenya said the \u201cnew maritime border that the court has specified gives most of the disputed territory to Somalia and a little sliver of it to Kenya.\n\n\u201cThe court has already said Kenya does not have any legal grounds to reject this judgement because it signed up to this court\u2019s authority in the 1960s and can\u2019t retroactively renege on that,\u201d Webb said.\n\n\u201cThe question now is will Kenya accept this ruling and if it does not, it puts Somalia in a stronger position to seek support from the UN to seek diplomatic support in enforcing or obliging Kenya to uphold this ruling.\u201d",
