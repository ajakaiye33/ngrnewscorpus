This number is not very encouraging, hence, the need for all eligible Nigerians to come out and be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cHowever, the PSC has reviewed these situations around the world and applies such to the situation in Nigeria and have revised the International Travel Protocols, which should come into effect on Monday, 4th April, 2022 as follows: In-bound (fully vaccinated) passengers arriving in Nigeria will no longer be required to take a pre-departure PCR COVID-19 Test.\n\n\u201cOn arrival, for fully vaccinated passengers, a sample will be taken at the airport for rapid antigen test by the NCDC within the arrival hall of the airport; passengers who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated shall take a COVID-19 PCR test 48 hours before departure, or do a Day 2 and day 7 test on arrival.\n\n\u201cSuch passengers will be expected to pay for their PCR tests through the travel platform; fully vaccinated passengers will not be charged for arrival rapid antigen tests at the airport;rules that apply to fully vaccinated adults also apply to children aged 10 \u2013 18 years; they will not be required to have pre-arrival PCR tests but will have a sample taken at the arrival hall but not charged.\n\n\u201cAll passengers travelling out of Nigeria are encouraged to be fully vaccinated and to fully comply with COVID-19 protocols and requirements in their country of destination.\n\n\u201cThe PSC wishes to put Nigerians on notice that two major religious festivities (Easter and Sallah) are approaching and we shall be experiencing increased passenger traffic in and out of the country. While the PSC prepares to escalate surveillance and other control activities, we urge the States and all Nigerians to also increase their vigilance and take measures to moderate activities.\u201d\n\nRecall that following vaccines received from foreign donors, the Nigerian government made appeals to citizens to get vaccinated, but in the past few months apathy towards the virus has set in.",

A government should not be seen or perceived remotely or otherwise as protecting a bunch of killers.\n\n\u201cThe most disturbing phenomenon is that whenever these attacks are imminent or happening, the people who are usually at the receiving ends of these attacks usually raise alarm mostly on social media.\n\n\u201cThe alarms are usually circulated but they don\u2019t get interventions as if people just wait and see how many casualties would be recorded and how many houses burnt .\n\n\u201cNothing gets done and nobody is held accountable for those attacks and nobody is ever punished among the heads of security for negligence of duty, dereliction of duty or total failure.\n\n\u201cBut we get to hear news stories that are all over the place of DSS accusing governors of plotting to [undermine democracy.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re not concerned about the veracity or otherwise of the DSS claim. We\u2019re not contending the veracity or otherwise of that statement but we are saying that that statement is vexatious.\n\n\u201cHow can you be talking about governors trying to set inter-ethnic crisis when people are already being killed and you\u2019re not doing anything about it? And you\u2019re saying some people are plotting and you couldn\u2019t even name the governors making the plot.\n\n\u201cYou just make a generalised statement that is so annoying. And as you\u2019re making that statement people are being killed in many communities like chickens. Less than four hours ago, people, not too far away from Abuja, Kagoro is just two hours drive from Abuja. Nigerians were killed.\n\n\u201cThey said over 50 people were killed and several houses were raised to the ground and these people actually raised alarm when they sighted the attackers and nothing ever happened and you\u2019re here telling us that governors are plotting to undermine democracy.\u201d",

They\u2019ve been very useful, working with other security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t also wait, we initiated a community-oriented program where the vigilante approach has been re-enacted and the community leaders have shown sufficient interest. We\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\nReacting to the allegation that his administration might be culpable in the crisis in his state, as it had been accused of sponsoring some of the people behind the trouble, including the \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 phenomenon, Uzodinma described such thinking as abnormal.\n\n\u201cWell, thank God that you called us government and I don\u2019t know how a government, with paraphernalia of office available to it, ranging from the army, the police, the air force, the navy, the DSS, the Civil Defense, will now go for non-state actors to be used for governance.\n\n\u201cAs civilized people, you also represent the elites, you should be able to advise such minds to reason well and think well because the only person that officially has power for coercion is government. If anything is to go by, we are a God-fearing government, that is why we have not used force as the only way of controlling the violence in Imo State.\u201d",

So, we are telling you so that nobody on the 26th, will have the guts to tell us to extend. Now, we have registered about 1.5 to 1.6 million candidates; so, we are good to go.\n\n\u201cYou can see how vacant the registration centres are. As big and as efficient as this centre is you have only one candidate and look at your time. So, it shows clearly that candidates are not coming out or we may have exhausted the number of candidates that are eligible for registration.\n\n\u201cWe are working on a very tight schedule because of the other examination bodies who has their slot and we cannot encroach into the slot of NECO or WAEC or NABTEB. We have a very tight schedule. And that is why we continue to say yes, we have capacity to register 100,000 in a day.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: JAMB discovers 1m illegal admissions\n\nThe JAMB boss urged prospective candidates to come out and register, adding that the board was taking the campaign to the public to call its attention to the fact that students are not coming out to register so there would be no appeal to the board to extend the date.\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd we have been registering seventy, eight but now we are registering; day before yesterday we registered less than 20,000. So, we are saying that all the people who want to register should register now because there will be no extension.\u201d\n\nOloyede urged the media to take a tour of the CBT facilities in Abuja and witness the low turnout of candidates for registration in the closing days of the exercise.\n\nOn the complaints by CBT centres over the high cost of diesel and energy problems in the country, Oloyede said the board is trying to open a discussion with the NNPC and after due consultations, it would do something about it.\n\n\u201cSince we have pegged our charges at N700, they are complaining because they felt that it is practically impossible to run. We are not oblivious to the situation. We are in consultation with NNPC. We want to know what the situation is and by God\u2019s grace, when we have the appropriate advice from the NNPC, we would address the issue.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to our partners the CBT centres to please be patient with us and give efficient services to our people. We are not wicked; we wouldn\u2019t want people to run at loss, but this is where we are; we would see what we can do. We would take appropriate,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Court Dismisses Another Suit Seeking Sack of Buni-led CECPC",
          "text": "\n\n*Holds serving governors, other members of committee not on paid employment\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Y. Halilu of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court has dismissed a suit challenging the legality of the Caretaker /Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHalilu, in a judgement delivered March 1, with its Certified True Copy Dated March 18, which was sighted by THISDAY, held that the claimant woefully failed to prove allegations made against the defendants.\n\n\n\nThe claimant, former Chairman of the Kwara State APC, Bashir Bolarinwa, had last year dragged the party and members of CECPC to court challenging the legality of the committee set up June 25, 2020 as well as his removal as Kwara State APC Chairman. Bolarinwa also challenged the powers of APC\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) to dissolve the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee in 2020, among other issues.\n\n\n\nAPC, CECPC Chairman Mai Mala Buni, John Akpanudoedehe, Abubakar Bello, Isiaka Bello, Stella Okotete, Professor Tahir Mamman, Ken Nnamani, Senator Abubakar Yusuf, Hon Akinremi Olaide, Dr. James Lalu, Chief David Lyon, Senator Abba Ali, Ismael Ahmed, and Abdulahi Samario, were the first to 15th defendants, respectively, in the suit.\n\nAmong the issues Bolarinwa took to court for determination were: whether the appointment of the 2, 4, and 5 defendants, being serving governors of Yobe, Niger and Osun states respectively, as Chairman and members of CECPC of the APC, was legal and constitutional, having regard to the provisions of Section 183and 223 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\n\nHe said if the question was answered in the negative, whether their appointment was not a gross violation of the constitution.\n\nClaimant further urged the court to determine whether the decision of the APC NEC made on December 8, 2020 to extend the tenure of the CECPC for a period of six months was valid, having regard to Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 of the APC constitution.\n\n\n\nAmong the declarations Bolarinwa sought from the court was that Buni and the other serving governors\u2019 presence in CECPC was illegal and unconstitutional with regard to Sections 183 and 223 of the constitution. He further called for another declaration that having violated the provisions of Sections 183 and 223 of the constitution, the governors were no longer entitled to Section 308, which guaranteed their immunity from prosecution.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the claimant urged the court to declare that all decisions and actions taken by CECPC from June 25, 2020 till they were removed from office were illegal, null and void, having regard to Section 183, 223 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 of the APC constitution.\n\n\n\nThe court was then urged for an order removing the second to 14th defendants from office as chairman and members of CECPC, as well as another nullifying and setting aside all actions and purported removal of claimant by the second to 14th defendants on January 4, 2021\n\nBolarinwa had sought, \u201cAn order nullifying and setting aside the purported ward congresses conducted by the CECPC in Kwara State on July 31, 2021\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the first to 14th defendants from conducting any other congresses into any office in the APC pursuant to the Notice of Congress issued by the second to 14th defendants or from performing any other functions in their capacities as CEPCC.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after an examination of the case of the claimant, the court came to the conclusion that the, \u201cContention of the claimant is borne out of the misinterpretation and misconception of the provisions of Sections 183, 223 of the constitution as well as provisions referred to in this case which clearly shows the claimant\u2019s failure to appreciate the essence and purpose of the resolution of the APC\u2019s NEC on June 25, 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe court also noted that the fulcrum of the claimant\u2019s complaint against the dissolution of the NWC were that the appointment of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 14th defendants contravened Section 183 and Article 17 of APC and that the appointment of CECPC by NEC to take the place of NWC was not democratic in line with Section 223 of the constitution.\n\nThe court explained that all the allegations were denied by the defendants, thereby putting the claimant to the strictest proof of the same.\n\nAccording to the judge, the claimant could not prove that the governors and other members of CECPC, who are sitting and serving members took up the appointment in full capacity or are in paid employment in that executive official capacity to constitute an infraction or contravention of the provision of Section 183 of the constitution.\n\nHalilu stated that the counter affidavits of the defendants also showed that they were constituted to temporarily perform the function of conducting the national convention of APC and nothing more.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the dissolution of the Oshiomhole NWC, the court held that NEC did not violate the constitution of the party as Article 13 (3) of the APC constitution empowered it to intervene when there was crisis in the running of the party and that by setting up CECPC, which was mandated to conducted a national convention to elect new NWC, , NEC was in order.\n\n\n\nThe judge further explained that Section 223 of the constitution was not a guarantee of tenure of office of four years but rather for the conduct of election into the party elective offices by political parties.\n\nOn the removal of the claimant by CECPC in January last year, the court held that he who had power to appoint also had the power to fire, adding that NEC donated its powers to CECPC when it inaugurated the committee to replace the NWC in the interim.\n\n\n\nThe judge accordingly dismissed the suit for lacking in merit.\n\nHalilu held, \u201cClaimant has woefully failed to justify the grant of reliefs sought in his originating summons. The entire suit having regards to the facts and circumstances of the same, constitute an abuse of judicial process and liable to be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI shall dismiss the said suit by consigning the same to a forlorn of judicial debris.\n\n\u201cAccordingly suit number CV/2006/2021 is hereby dismissed for the reason advanced.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Aminu Bello Masari had earlier scheduled to conduct the screening exercise in two batches yesterday and today.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY however gathered that the exercise did not start yesterday as scheduled apparently due to the late submission of forms by the aspirants. Though the party gave no reason for not commencing the exercise as scheduled, it was learnt that the aspirants were still returning their forms as of 7 p.m. last night.\n\nWith the delay in the commencement of the screening, the seven chairmanship aspirants are expected to be screened on Monday.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Chairman of Venue, Decoration, and Site Servicing Committee for the National Convention and Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong has promised adequate security and logistics for the event.\n\nChairmanship aspirants who beat the deadline for the submission of nomination forms were two former governors of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; Senator Sani Mohammed Musa; former Governor of Benue State and Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; former Governor of Zamfara State, Senator Abdulaziz Yari; and the youngest aspirant, Mr. Etsu Mohammed.\n\n\n\nYari, who is from the North-west, is the only aspirant that is not from the North-central, which is expected to produce the party\u2019s national chairmanship, according to the zoning arrangement.\n\nYari\n\nYari was a two-term Governor of Zamfara State and a one-time Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), a position that gave him a lot of influence and respect among his former colleagues and some serving governors. He has the resources and political experience.\n\n\n\nIf antecedents are anything to go by, then it would be difficult for Yari to realise his ambition. The way Yari managed the 2018 primaries before the 2019 elections caused all the APC candidates in the state to lose the elections to the PDP. Also, his inability to curtail bandits during his tenure as the governor of Zamfara State was a disaster. Today, bandits have almost crippled not only the state but the nation. The defection of the current Governor Bello Matawalle to the ruling APC is seen by political watchers as a threat to his aspirations. Matawalle is reportedly not on the same page with Yari. The zoning arrangement of APC is also not in his favour.\n\nSaliu Mustapha\n\nHe is the Turaki of Ilorin. Mallam Saliu Mustapha is the founder of Saliu Mustapha Foundation (SMF) which is involved in huge philanthropic services.\n\nA die-hard Buharist, Mustapha paid his dues in political party administration. He was once a national deputy chairman of the defunct CPC, one of the legacy parties that formed the APC. His membership of the defunct CPC gave him an edge as both ACN and ANPP blocs have had their slots; it is the turn of the CPC bloc to produce the next national chairman.\n\nHis weakness is that he lacks leadership experience as he has never held any other political appointment apart from the deputy chairman of the defunct CPC.\n\nGeorge Akume\n\nAkume was a two-term governor of Benue State, former senator, and a serving Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs. With these positions, he has acquired enough leadership experience to manage the diverse interests of the ruling party.\n\nAs a cabinet member, he can also galvanise the support of some of his colleagues to realise his ambition. He also has the intellectual and mental capacity required to battle for the national chairmanship seat. His major weak point was the loss of APC in the state to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nTanko Al-Makura\n\nAl-Makura is also a former Nasarawa State Governor. The 69-year-old businessman-turned-politician is also keen on becoming the next APC chairman. As a former governor and serving Senator, Al-Makura has the required resources, experience, and network to become the next national chairman. Al-Makura has running battles with the EFCC. Last year, he visited the EFCC headquarters a couple of times to answer questions on money laundering running into billions of naira. The former governor, however, said he was only invited by the EFCC but was never detained.\n\nAbdullahi Adamu\n\nAdamu was the pioneer Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and the current senator representing Nasarawa West senatorial district in the National Assembly.\n\nAdamu was governor of Nasarawa State from May 29, 1999, to May 29, 2007. He is believed to have been anointed as the consensus national chairman but the other contestants have refused to accept his nomination.\n\nAs a third-term senator and former governor, he has the enormous experience to pilot the affairs of the ruling party.\n\nAt 75, some party leaders believe Adamu is too old to be in the race, taking into cognisance the complex nature of the job.\n\nSani Mohammed Musa\n\nThe 54-year-old member of the upper chamber of the National Assembly represents Niger East senatorial district. He has a good relationship with party members. Two governors were said to have recommended him to President Muhammadu Buhari as a consensus candidate. However, he does not have the necessary experience as a party administrator.\n\nEtsu Mohammed\n\nAt just 37, Mohammed is the youngest of all the aspirants. He is an aide to Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State and a former youth leader of the defunct ANPP. Not much is known about him politically.\n\nIyiola Omisore\n\nFor the position of the National Secretary of the party, zoned to the South-west, a former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore has also submitted his nomination form. Omisore was a senator from 2003 to 2011. A former Minister for Communication, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu, and an Executive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Ife Oyedele are also in the race but it was not clear if they had submitted their forms as of last night.\n\nAdebayo Shittu\n\nA former Minister for Communication, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu is the first person to indicate interest in the office of APC National Secretary. However, Shittu\u2019s aspiration did not garner the support of the APC governors in the South-west. That did not deter him from pursuing his aspiration, leveraging on his goodwill with Buhari\u2019s political allies.\n\nShittu, a member of the 2005 National Political Reform Conference, has been an ally of Buhari.\n\nIfe Oyedele\n\nExecutive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Ife Oyedele, is another aspirant for the office of APC National Secretary. Before he was appointed NDPHC\u2019s executive director in charge of Engineering &Technical Services, little was known about Oyedele. Like Shittu, he has been close to the political family of the president since the time of the defunct CPC.\n\n\n\nHe was among the key persons that promoted Buhari\u2019s presidential aspiration in 2011. At its formation, Oyedele served on the CPC Constitution Drafting Committee and also represented the party during the alliance talk in 2011 and merger talks that produced the APC in 2013. He also contested the governorship election in Ondo State in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\n\nThe position of the Deputy National Chairman (North) is being contested by Mr. Sunny Monidafe, and Senator Abubakar Girei, while the National Vice Chairman (South-south) is being contested by Mr. Yekini Nabena, a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC.\n\n\n\nMr. Ismaeel Ahmed and Abubakar Fakai are contesting for the post of National Organising Secretary, while Mr. Isaacs Kekemeke and Afeez Bolaji Repete, are jostling for the position of the National Vice Chairman (South-west)\n\nFor the position of the National Women Leader, Mary Eta and Hellen Effiong are in the race for the job.\n\n\n\nThe position of the Zonal Organising Secretary (South-west) is being contested by Mr. Femi Egbedeyi, while Mr. Olusegun Dada and Rinsola Abiola are in the race for the position of the National Youth Leader.\n\nThe Deputy National Youth Leader is being contested by Jamal Kabiru, while the Zonal Organising Secretary (North-West) is being contested by Salihu Uba.\n\n\n\nHalima Ibrahim is contesting for the position of the Deputy National Women Leader of the APC. This list is however not exhausting as more aspirants were still returning their forms last night.\n\nWe Will Provide Adequate Security, Logistics for Convention, Says Lalong\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of Venue, Decoration and Site Servicing committee, and Plateau State Governor, Lalong has promised a hitch-free convention.\n\n\n\nA statement by Lalong\u2019s director of press, Simon Macham quoted the governor as saying, \u201cWe are working closely with the committees on security, protocol, and others to ensure that there is a synergy which will lead to the conduct of a hitch-free exercise.\u201d\n\n\n\nLalong had led members of the committee to Eagle Square Abuja, the venue of the proposed convention to inspect the facility and also interface with the management.\n\nHe said the Committee would have started making arrangements at the venue before now, but for the Science and Technology Expo which just ended at the same venue.\n\n\n\nLalong however said he had been meeting and engaging relevant stakeholders to ensure that the plans for the venue and associated services are put in place for the comfort of delegates and officials during the APC convention.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Northern group rallies support for CBN gov\u2019s presidency\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi, Uzoma Mba in Lagos and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\nA civil society organisation, Save Nigeria Project (SNP), has alleged that desperate politicians have approached it and other credible groups to launch a million-dollar smear campaign against President Muhammadu Buhari; his economic agenda, as well as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele and his monetary policies.\n\nThis is coming as the Unified Northern Nigeria Youth Forum (UNNYF) yesterday stormed Nasarawa State in continuation of its consultations with relevant stakeholders in the northern states to put pressure on Emefiele to contest for the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\n\nSNP disclosed the alleged smear campaign plot yesterday at a World Press Conference on 2023 and the State of the Nation, held in Lagos, which had in attendance, representatives from Arewa Consultative Youth Movement, All Progressives Congress (APC) Young Professionals Movement, and Niger Delta Youth Vanguard.\n\n\n\nOthers include the Yoruba Council of Youths, Igbo Youth Movement, Middle Belt Youth Movement, South East Youth Assembly and Lawyers in Defence of Democracy.\n\nSNP Convener, Mr Peter Abang, said they alerted the public to disregard the smear campaigns once they kicked off.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Save Nigeria Project will also take advantage of this briefing to alert the world on the activities of desperate politicians ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWe have been approached and we believe, many other credible groups have also been approached by some desperate politicians of questionable character with a pool of funds of up to one million Dollars to be allegedly shared by consenting groups for a massive smear campaign against the person of President Buhari, his economic agenda, the person and office of Mr Godwin Emefiele and his policies in the CBN.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have outrightly rejected the offer. Nigerians should note that once this condemnable project starts, they should disregard it and treat them with the disdain they deserve,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said part of the plan by those behind the plot was to clone and impersonate credible groups to churn out lies and misrepresentation of facts.\n\n\n\nPassing a vote of confidence on President Buhari, SNP said the country has been on a steady march towards development since 2015, adding that more infrastructural growth has been recorded than at any other time.\n\n\u201cThe unprecedented revolution in the agricultural sector cannot be overemphasised in discussing the state of the nation today.\n\n\n\n\u201cUntil President Buhari came to power, no Nigerian had ever seen massive pyramids built with only rice paddy.\n\n\u201cNigeria was never rated as a global producer of rice before 2015 but now it is a super force in global rice production and no longer a dumping ground for spoilt unhealthy rice from Asia and other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cOn the economic front, we note that the latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that inflation is going down. This shows a positive trajectory and recovery for the economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough the various Social Intervention Programmes now domiciled in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, the federal government has lifted millions out of penury and joblessness into economic productivity and prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe economy has also expanded and fortified against global shocks in record time, beating the projection of financial experts, the country has exited recession. Available data also show economic growth which is more than the projections.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is given this favourable assessment of our country\u2019s leadership and the state of the nation this first quarter of 2022 that we as a civil society organisation pass a vote of confidence on President Muhammadu Buhari, his economic agenda and the monetary policies of the Central Bank of Nigeria ably led by Mr Godwin Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele\u201d.\n\nThe group commended APC for \u201czoning power to the South in the interest of peace and inclusiveness,\u201d urging other political parties to do the same.\n\n\n\nIt said the country should have a president that would continue to consolidate and expand the vision, as well as the landmark legacy of Buhari, adding that a thorough professional of Igbo extraction should succeed the president next year.\n\n\n\nSNP also called on Buhari to support a candidate who embodies a winnable personality and ticks all the numerous boxes, adding that it should be someone he would be proud of.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is after a very rigorous search that we have come to the unequivocal and emphatic conclusion that only one man fits this description and we make bold to present to Mr President for his endorsement and to Nigerians for their massive support, Mr Godwin, Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria for President, 2023. Emefiele has shown unprecedented sagacity as Governor of the country\u2019s central bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis initiatives for small, medium and large scale enterprises have been unprecedented. In manufacturing, oil and gas, agriculture, trade and commerce, the signature of the CBN Governor has been very clear and precise.\n\n\u201cThe numerous interventions of the bank under high standard supervision is second to none. Rice farmers in our country have never had it so good in our entire history,\u201d the group added.\n\nNorthern Group Rallies Support for Emefiele\u2019s Presidency\n\nIn a related development, a northern group, UNNYF yesterday stormed Nasarawa State in continuation of its consultations with relevant stakeholders in the northern states to put pressure on Emefiele to contest for the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\n\nAddressing stakeholders in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, the spokesperson of the youth group, Mr Aliyu Muhammad Sani, said the forum has been going around some states in the North for consultations with relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n\nSani explained that the youth group embarked on the consultation to produce a credible, competent, and economically-endowed leader that would consolidate on rapid economic growth that the CBN governor had already started in his current position.\n\n\n\n\u201cI stand to be corrected, but I dare boldly to say that, Mr Godwin Emefiele\u2019s achievements have reflected in all states of the country and are there for history and posterity to judge.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt never came easy; it was not done at his comfort zone, rather, it took a lot of courage, foresight, perseverance, determination, and hard work to overcome the numerous challenges scavenging on the fragile economy of our dear nation,\u201d Sani said.\n\n\n\nHe concluded that Emefiele had contained and dealt with a 60 per cent decline in the price of crude oil.\n\nIn a remark, the Nasarawa State Coordinator for UNNYF for Emefiele 2023, Mr Faruk Mohammed Ofoku, said the Lafia consultation became necessary considering the youthful inclusion of Nasarawa youth in the decision-making process in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe good people of Nasarawa State benefited so much from the good stewardship of the current CBN Governor. Nasarawa is the home of solid minerals; Mr Emefiele\u2019s policies of diversification invested so much in solid mineral resources and agriculture.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooking at all these economic and life-saving interventions of the CBN Governor in Nasarawa State and all other northern states, we the progressive Northern Nigerian Youth of Nasarawa State joined the National leadership of our Coalition and strongly call on Mr Godwin Emefiele to please, as matter of urgency, declare to run for the President of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d Ofoku explained.\n\nOfoku said their call was timely because the Nasarawa youths wanted their economy, especially mining and agriculture, to be rejuvenated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa",
          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Tangerine Africa, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nhe told me to stop wearing dresses. that i need to wear jackets & trouser suit all the time (presumably to cover my breasts) after his gf alice commented saying she liked them\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "text": "Google has announced that Equiano, a subsea internet cable running through Portugal to South Africa, will first land in Togo. Equiano is expected to land in South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena later in the year, connecting the continent with Europe.\n\nThis announcement marks a milestone in Google\u2019s plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Last October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa, of which project Equiano is part of.\n\nMap of Africa indicating Lisbon, Togo, and Cape Town landings with branching units\n\nFor Togo which currently ranks as the sixth-best country in Africa regarding ease of doing business, the landing of Equiano opens up more possibilities and opportunities. It\u2019s expected that once connected to Equiano, it will provide 20 times more bandwidth than any other cable currently serving West Africa, helping Togo attract even more investments and further boosting its vibrant startup culture.\n\n\u201cBroadening the access to high-speed internet is a fundamental part in our national digital development process as we strive towards achieving the objectives set out in our Digital 2025 Strategy,\u201d Cina Lawson, Minister of Digital Economy and Digital Transformation for Togo said.\n\nAccording to an economic impact assessment of Equiano in Togo from Africa Practice and Genesis Analytics, it is estimated that the subsea cable will add approximately 37,000 new jobs between 2022 and 2025, and increase Togo\u2019s economic output by an additional USD 351 million during the same period.\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa commented, \u201cThe landing of Equiano affirms Google\u2019s commitment to the African continent, to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation. We are thrilled that Togo will be Equiano\u2019s first landing on the African continent, as it aligns with the country\u2019s continuing efforts to promote digital inclusion for Africa.\u201d\n\nThis announcement is coming a year after Google shut down project Loon, a cost-effective solution to the difficult challenge of bringing internet access to people in underserved remote areas. The shutdown of Google\u2019s Project Loon brought up questions about the fate of Google\u2019s other internet projects targeted at Africa. The progress made so far hints that Equiano will be different from Loon.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difficulties in Africa\u2019s financial sector create room for many opportunities. Like a giant onion bulb, when one financial service issue is resolved, other layers reveal more issues to be solved.\n\nWhen businesses found it difficult to receive payments online, people hurt under ridiculous bank charges, but fintech companies have come to the rescue.\n\nToday, financial inclusion has improved considerably from previous years. For example, Nigeria\u2019s banked adult population has increased from 36 million in 2016 to 47.7 million in 2020. As of March 13, 2022, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) places the number of Nigerian bank account holders at 53 million.\n\nHowever, the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion growth has come from savings and payments, leaving a considerable gap in the credit and insurance space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdedeji Olowe, Open Banking Nigeria Trustee, believes that unlocking credit access is a surer method of boosting financial inclusion in Africa. Tying into his ambition to democratise banking in Nigeria, he is currently building Lendsqr, a startup that would create large-scale lending infrastructure in Africa.\n\n\u201cI believe that without an evolving middle-class, we may not come out of our national morass. But without credit to help people stand up, the middle-class wouldn\u2019t emerge.\u201d\n\nWith over two decades of experience in banking, credit, technology, and venture capital, Olowe delved into lending in his two-year (2006 \u2013 2008) stint at First City Monument Bank (FCMB), one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks, where he built a lending system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nOlowe, who is on the boards of Sparkle and Paystack, has been neck-deep in Nigeria\u2019s financial space, having previously been the chairman of TeamApt.\n\nOlowe is currently building a reputation as Africa\u2019s Open Banking leader, and our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, went behind the scenes of his enviable LinkedIn profile. However, building any lending solution is tough, but what the fintech mogul has planned with Lendsqr is a different beast entirely.\n\nThe stubborn onion bulb\n\nNigeria\u2019s lending space could be likened to the difficult parts of the onion bulb that are not so straightforward to peel. Accessing credit in Nigeria is difficult, and for good reasons.\n\nA 2021 Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) report reveals that in 2020, only 3% of Nigeria\u2019s 106 million adults had access to credit from a regulated financial institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a low percentage points to a considerable gap, and per Lendqr\u2019s analysis, the credit market is worth \u20a672 trillion ($173.5 billion) in Nigeria alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraditional financial institutions should be jumping at the opportunity, right? Apparently not, and for a good reason.\n\nMost financial institutions across Africa are only willing to lend to the most creditworthy of borrowers like governments, large corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. The scenario is different for small businesses and regular individuals.\n\n\u201cSmall firms and individuals borrow at high rates because of the high risks involved as lenders do not have information on their credit behaviours,\u201d said Juma Reli, Bank of Tanzania Deputy Governor, at the launch of the country\u2019s official databank.\n\nIn recent years, several digital lending platforms have sprung up in Nigeria, but going by current events, most have been operating illegally and unethically. The few legal ones constantly deal with loan defaulters.\n\nIn 2009, just 15 million Kenyans had access to credit, but that number rose by 7.2 million in the next seven years.\n\nHowever, loan defaulters and rogue lenders are also increasing.\n\nAll things considered, Olowe believes it may be hard to blame institutional lenders. The average Nigerian\u2019s credit score has not improved considerably, and the low lending percentage says it all.\n\n\u201cThen came the light bulb moment \u2014 what if tech and data are combined, made available at bargain prices, to enable lenders to lend securely and responsibly? Wouldn\u2019t that make lenders expand? Wouldn\u2019t that curb chronic debtors and block them from abusing credits?\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that make institutional investors make capital available to lenders? Wouldn\u2019t lenders be able to reach Africans at the point of need through BNPL?\u201d Olowe asks.\n\nProviding a solution\n\nTo tackle the issues with lending, Lendsqr provides small to medium-sized lenders with a comprehensive technology and data stack to lend to customers at scale using the best of breed decision engine, integration to payments systems, and data for quality decisions.\n\nAn excellent way to explain the startup\u2019s value offering would be Canadian tech giant, Shopify. The platform allows retailers to create and manage their online stores. If you have anything to sell online, Shopify takes the pains of creating your website and lets you customise the platform to attract visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Lendsqr provides a platform for any company interested in entering the lending game.\n\n\u201cOur stack has 100% of everything a lender needs to lend. And they can register and issue their first loan in five minutes, running off one of the largest data repositories for credit in Nigeria. All for free.\u201d\n\nFor context, data on a business or an individual is critical for any lending decision. Your employment history, your income level, and your debt-to-income ratio all come into play. Behind the scenes, there are hundreds of data variables to choose from.\n\nOlowe explains that this data comes from lenders already on Lendsqr and from other established lenders, who he prefers to keep secret for now. Lendsqr is also plugged into the CRC Credit Bureau and Credit Registry.\n\nRecall that in 2020, a former OKash CEO went on to create a Blacklist, a platform for small digital lenders to access data on Nigerian borrowers.\n\nThe Blacklist creator, Darlington Onyeagoro, who\u2019s currently CEO of Aladdin, a digital bank, argued that such a platform would create little escape room for serial defaulters.\n\nOn the flip side, such a platform can be positively used by lenders to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWe plan to use this data to unleash credit for the underbanked. And we\u2019re powering our lenders to reach their customers via our Web app, Android app, iOS app, and Web SDK,\u201d Olowe explains.\n\nLendsqr has painstakingly assembled a team of engineers and data experts with experience in Nigeria\u2019s credit and tech space. However, there are players with similar value offerings.\n\nIn 2020, Evolve Credit went live as a marketplace for borrowers to review and choose the best lenders to borrow from. Since its launch, it has evolved into a platform offering a cloud-based solution for would-be lenders. It claims to help them set up in 24 hours.\n\nIndicina\u2019s product, Originate, helps lenders digitise identity verification, credit decision/analytics, and disbursements and collections.\n\nThough initially offering similar features to the other two, Creditclan, has pivoted to aid the process for buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies, a growing sensation in the eCommerce space.\n\nInterestingly, Lendsqr claims its customers can start lending in five mins with already configured products and domain names.\n\n\u201cOur cost of set up and user onboarding is as cheap as free (\u20a60). Our decision engine is very smart with over 300 data variables available for lenders to tweak as they wish, yet we provide them with simple start configurations, to begin with,\u201d Olowe submits.\n\nContinuing, he says, \u201cOur collections and recovery is relentless; it hunts down bad borrowers until the very end. We have one of the largest blacklists to protect lenders from predatory borrowers and chronic debtors.\n\n\u201cFor our APIs, unlike the credit bureau and others, we only charge if and only if it finds data.\u201d\n\nSolutions can be tearful\n\nLendsqr\u2019s aggressive approach certainly comes at a cost. Few people can boast of not tearing up when peeling an onion or trying to build a startup\n\nIf Lendsqr has zero costs for setup and user onboarding, how does it make money? The answer seemingly lies in playing an Amazon-esque long game.\n\n\u201cThe core of our revenue model is charging a fee when we help lenders collect their loans. And there is an alignment \u2014 we don\u2019t charge them before \u2014 our bread isn\u2019t buttered before theirs,\u201d Olowe insists.\n\nConsidering this, any keen observer can guess Lendsqr will earnestly chase growth and try to corner the lending market. So far, it is growing an enviable user base.\n\nThe CEO claims that Lendsqr already has over 100 lenders offering credit to almost half a million users.\n\n\u201cLendsqr will break even after two years. We follow the model of Amazon \u2014 amazing technology and data play at basement level pricing,\u201d Olowe maintains, and for emphasis, adds Jeff Bezos\u2019 famous words, \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhen building products for the African market, its peculiarities have to be addressed. For instance, the challenges involved with building a lending infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe cost of underwriting is high in Africa, which puts lenders in a bind. The technology is too expensive to build. Or the cost of data (Credit bureau and statement) is so expensive it is ruinous to small ticket loans.\u201d\n\nOlowe and his team at Lendsqr have had to draw on their wealth of experience and network to navigate the space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to engage with different data providers, credit bureaus, and others. We successfully argued cases for cheaper and scalable lending with the likes of CRC and Mono, who are partners in this journey.\u201d\n\nThese were just some of the wins, though, as Lendsqr had to walk away from some data providers with unnecessarily high usage costs.\n\nThe rewards at the end\n\nWhen eating a well-prepared meal, few people remember the tear-filled eyes of the onion-slicing cook. The same applies to the founder of a unicorn. For a financial sector replete with lending-averse financial institutions, Olowe is adamant that Lendsqr is tailored to match the market\u2019s reality.\n\n\u201cWe are a scale company. We understand that the categories of lenders we are serving are super sensitive about pricing, and we offer propositions that are unmatched in value anywhere in Africa.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Olowe, Lendsqr is using its scale to pass on cost savings to the lenders, which invariably leads to cheaper loans for Africans and Nigerians.\n\nSo far, Lendsqr\u2019s approach has won the hearts of investors as it has closed an undisclosed pre-seed round. On the strength of this, Lendsqr has some major upgrades in sight.\n\n\u201cIn four months, our lenders would have access to native mobile SDKs that allow them to lend even to the mass market, using their phone data for free instead of paying over $0.5 (\u20a6250) as offered by many lendtech providers.\u201d\n\nThe startup also plans to hit customers at their point of need by targeting BNPL players across different sectors.\n\nBeyond technology, it also plans to connect lenders with capital providers to help them scale their lending.\n\nOlowe encapsulates Lendsqr\u2019s immediate vision with the following words:\n\n\u201cWithin 18 months, 1 in 4 consumer credit in Nigeria would either be originated by lenders on Lendsqr or Lendsqr would have provided data comfort to other lenders.\u201d\n\nTo understand the full impact of Lendsqr\u2019s development, one only needs to look at the recent funding trends for BNPL startups, credit-led neobanks, and innovative companies like Indicina and Evolve Credit playing in the space. All things being equal, Africa\u2019s lending scene looks set to explode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, March 11, 2022, we hosted the first Techpoint Pitch Friday of 2022.\n\nSince 2018 when the first session of Pitch Friday was held, we\u2019ve provided a stage for budding entrepreneurs to share their ideas, get feedback, and refine their pitches.\n\nThe audience is not left out either. They gain a better understanding of business processes and meet individuals with similar interests. It wasn\u2019t different this time, and the event kicked off by 5:15 p.m.\n\nProviding credit financing for Africans\n\nAfter a brief introduction, the first entrepreneur \u2014 Dayo Oyekanmi \u2014 stepped up to pitch his startup \u2014 Harmony. Harmony plans to play in the increasingly competitive buy now, pay later industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOyekanmi shared that it plans to focus on providing credit financing for its consumers. Rather than hold inventory, the startup will assess data provided by a prospective customer to determine how much credit they can extend. Currently running its private beta, the startup also plans to issue credit cards that will be used to shop at partner merchants.\n\nEmergency responses for Nigerians\n\nThe second person to pitch was Oluwafemi Adeleke. His startup, Siara, plans to provide emergency response and security services for Nigerians using a community model. Unlike Harmony, Adeleke disclosed that Siara had not launched but was still in development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback and networking\n\nProviding feedback to entrepreneurs is an integral part of Pitch Friday. Occasionally, entrepreneurs whose business models are still unclear get more clarity from questions asked by the audience.\n\nAfter the two entrepreneurs had pitched, they got questions and feedback from a highly engaged audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Oyekanmi, many of the questions revolved around the risk management and profitability of the business. He explained that the startup uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to assess a customer\u2019s capability to repay a loan while clarifying that it intends to focus on credit financing.\n\nWith Siara appearing to be offering too many services, the audience grilled Adeleke on the startup\u2019s core proposition.\n\nWhen the event ended at 6:30 p.m., participants hung around to meet each other. April\u2019s edition of Pitch Friday will be held on Friday, April 8, 2022, and you can register to pitch your startup or join the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nEver heard of the term, Hope as a Service? Well, me neither. At least until last Wednesday when we recorded the latest Techpoint Africa Podcast. I think it\u2019s a perfect phrase, though, and if you render that service or know someone who does, please point me in the right direction.\n\nIf the term confuses you, you should listen to last week\u2019s Podcast. Find it on your preferred streaming service here. (Please click \u201cIgnore\u201d when you get the warning)\n\nIn today\u2019s Digest, we have:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nthe Internet: one word connecting Google, MTN, and Ethiopia, and\n\nWaitlisting as a marketing strategy.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Equiano lands in Togo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, Google. Source: Supplied\n\nLet\u2019s start with an image: You\u2019re in the kitchen, standing over your sink, with a bowl in it and the tap running. For some reason, you\u2019re lost in thought, and you forget to turn off the faucet. Soon, everywhere is overflowing with water, and you still don\u2019t turn it off.\n\nWhy the analogy, though? Well, Google\u2019s subsea Internet cable \u2014 Equiano \u2014 has landed in Togo. The company announced this on Friday, March 18, 2022, and said it has partnered with ex-Google project, CSquared.\n\nStay with me a bit: First announced in 2019, Equiano is a 100 terabit fibre optic cable from Portugal to South Africa, with landing points in Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena and will connect Africa with Europe. As of 2021, the West and East African coasts each had cables with an Internet capacity of at least 100 Tbps.\n\nAdd Google\u2019s Equiano, and this becomes 300 Tbps. Technically, this should automatically mean faster Internet, right?\n\nNot so fast: However, the reality is, out of an available 100 million megabits per second, Ghana \u2014 the highest ranking African country for fixed broadband \u2014 has a speed of 53.28 megabits per second.\n\nWhy so tiny? Lack of Internet infrastructure. It\u2019s one thing for an Internet subsea cable to land on your shores, and it\u2019s another for it to get to where it\u2019s needed.\n\nHere\u2019s where the analogy comes back: Think of this as that bowl (Africa) overflowing with water (subsea Internet cables). The tap isn\u2019t turned off, and the wasted water is not helpful to anyone.\n\nHere\u2019s a handy explainer if you want to know more: Subsea Internet cables and the race to connect Africa to the Internet\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has a plan: CSquared provides fibre infrastructure that helps connect the Internet coming from subsea cables to where they are needed. So, this partnership with CSquared in Togo could mean that Google\u2019s Equiano\u2019s cable actually does the good it is intended to do.\n\nThere\u2019s also a boring backstory here of the government working together with CSquared to form CSquared Woezon, but there\u2019s also a bit more exciting news.\n\nNew jobs! According to Africa Practice and Genesis Analytics\u2019s economic impact assessment of Equiano in Togo, the subsea cable will add approximately 37,000 new jobs between 2022 and 2025, and increase Togo\u2019s economic output by an additional $351m during the same period. It also brings 20 times more bandwidth than any cable currently serving West Africa.\n\nWho\u2019s next? Word on the street says the cable will land in Nigeria next, then Namibia, and after South Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Eastern part of the continent, Ethiopia\u2019s government plans to sell part of its stake in Ethio Telecom have hit another snag. The country\u2019s Ministry of Finance announced this on Friday, March 18, 2022, and gave no definite date on when the process will continue. The race to commercialise one of the world\u2019s last state-owned monopolies is still on.\n\nElsewhere, MTN\u2019s bid to secure spectrum in South Africa has been successful. On Thursday, March 17, 2022, the telecom giant revealed that it had spent $347 million in the controversial Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) auction as it looks to expand its 4G and 5G coverage in South Africa.\n\nCurrently, MTN\u2019s 4G network supposedly covers 96% of the South African population. This spectrum allocation could mean more reach, coverage, and speeds.\n\nNigeria\u2019s electricity woes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, March 14, 2022, Nigeria\u2019s National electric grid collapsed, plunging many citizens into darkness. Barely 24 hours later, it collapsed once more on Tuesday.\n\nThe chart above shows the daily amount of energy generated as at Wednesday, March 16, 2022.\n\nWant a little more context? You can check out this article by BusinessDay\u2019s Oladehinde Oladipo\n\nTo see interesting statistics and charts like this, please, follow Techpoint Intelligence at @techpointintel on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nWaitlisting as a startup marketing strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just have to chip in that this heading reads like a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform. But then, away from Internet speeds and millions of dollars, we are moving on to waitlists.\n\nWhat is a waitlist? It is a marketing strategy used to create a sense of exclusivity while generating a buzz around a new product or service. For example, ABC company wants to launch a new and exciting product. So, they advertise the product and ask people to join a waitlist \u2014 basically fill in their names and email addresses \u2014 to be among the first new users.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably had to join a waitlist once or twice in the past few months. You also probably forgot about the product at some point, didn\u2019t you? So what\u2019s the hype around waitlists recently, and how can you use them correctly?\n\nWe had a chat with Ized Uanikhehi, Founder, Zedi Africa; Peace Obinani, Product Marketing Manager, PiggyVest; and Oluwaferanmi Ajetomobi, Co-founder, Ni Fries to answer some questions on when and why you should use a waitlist, how you should use it, privacy implications, among other things.\n\nFirst thing I can tell you for free is, don\u2019t forget to build the product you advertised while creating your waitlist. Things could get a little problematic.\n\nCatch up on our conversation here, and don\u2019t forget to watch out for our next Twitter Spaces in April.\n\nTechpoint Africa stories last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nMy week was relatively barren music-wise, but I can certainly recommend the latest Techpoint Africa Podcast this fine Monday morning. You can listen here (Please click \u201cIgnore\u201d when you get the warning)\n\nI found this story about this TikToker who moved into his office oddly hilarious. P.S.

          "title": "How corruption denies Nigeria of mining sector dollars",
          "text": "The Nigerian government is losing billions of dollars to illegal mining activities in the country\u2019s solid minerals sector as corruption continues to hold sway.\n\nThe Federal Government has often expressed keenness to develop the sector in order to diversify the economy by increasing its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exports and foreign reserves.\n\nThe Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) had in 2019 said the sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP was only a paltry 0.5 percent, compared to over 12.1 percent in the 1970s.\n\nIn contrast, the mining sector contributes much more to the national economy in countries such as Botswana, Ghana and South Africa at 16 percent, 12.6 percent and 7.3 percent respectively.\n\nA 2019 Columbia University Capstone report said to achieve its goal, \u201cthe government initially tried to attract FDI and multinational corporations into the Nigerian mining sector. It redefined its role from owner-operator to administrator-regulator.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet, investments did not pour in from abroad. Despite high commodity prices and a concerted effort by the government, not a single major mining company invested in Nigeria and only a few junior companies did. Foreign investors and companies continue to perceive the market as unsafe and challenging,\u201d it added.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Uche Ogar, admitted in 2021 that Nigeria lost over $5 billion through illegal smuggling of gold between 2012 and 2018.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), over $9 billion is lost every other year as a result of illegal mining activities in the country.\n\nLast year, market researchers at CSL Stockbrokers warned that illegal mining activities had continued to wipe gains in the sector.\n\nThey said, \u201cDespite the endowment of mineral resources in Nigeria, the solid minerals sector has significantly underperformed with a meagre contribution of less than one percent to the GDP over the years.\n\n\u201cThe figure is, however, solely from formal channels as the artisanal and small-scale mining activities that constitute over 80 percent of the current mining activities in the country are unaccounted for.\u201d\n\nThis is where Nigeria\u2019s mining problem lies. Nigerians, noted the Capstone report, have practised informal artisanal mining for centuries.\n\nIt said, \u201cToday, the activity is largely poverty-driven and supports the livelihoods of at least 500,000 people. Partly due to its informality, artisanal mining is associated with many negative externalities such as environmental degradation, crime and health hazards.\n\n\u201cOne tragic example is the 2010 lead poisoning outbreak in Nigeria\u2019s northwestern Zamfara State, which killed approximately 400 children and has affected thousands more.\u201d\n\nMaurice Ogbonna, a senior research consultant with the Pretoria-based Institute of Security Studies, said the rise in illegal mining \u201chighlights fundamental social, institutional and structural problems in Nigeria\u2019s governance system.\n\n\u201cIt reveals the prevailing socio-economic problems in the region, especially the inadequate responses to poverty and poor service delivery by the state,\u201d he added.\n\nAcross the country, large-scale illegal mining and small-scale artisanal mining dot the nation\u2019s landscape.\n\n\u201cIt is a sectoral landscape characterised by extreme corruption,\u201d an official of the Mining Cadastre Office in Abuja, the country\u2019s capital, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe Mining Cadastral Office is responsible for the issuance of mining titles/rights. It is also responsible for the promotion of private sector investment in the solid minerals sector, the improvement of the investment climate in the sector and attraction of foreign investors as well as the generation of appropriate revenue for the government.\n\nOutside the premises of the organisation in Lobito Crescent, a coterie of mostly young men parade around. \u201cThey are touts who help people to get mining titles, get coordinates and any information you might want from the Cadastre Office. It is easier and more efficient to deal with them than to deal with the officials of my office,\u201d the official said.\n\nOne of them, who simply identified himself as Paulson, told BusinessDay, \u201cWe work with officials of the Mining Cadastre Office.\n\n\u201cI am a businessman. If you want a mining site for gold, I can get you a correct site. What we do is: we lock down lucrative sites on the cadastral system and make them unavailable. We then market these sites to interested big miners.

At their peak in 2017, these mines in Niger employed as many as 600,000 people.

It is just not possible. They cannot see the gold; how can they determine the value? There are no inspectors to monitor our operations.

          "text": "The Nigerian government is losing billions of dollars to illegal mining activities in the country\u2019s solid minerals sector as corruption continues to hold sway.\n\nThe Federal Government has often expressed keenness to develop the sector in order to diversify the economy by increasing its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exports and foreign reserves.\n\nThe Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) had in 2019 said the sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP was only a paltry 0.5 percent, compared to over 12.1 percent in the 1970s.\n\nIn contrast, the mining sector contributes much more to the national economy in countries such as Botswana, Ghana and South Africa at 16 percent, 12.6 percent and 7.3 percent respectively.\n\nA 2019 Columbia University Capstone report said to achieve its goal, \u201cthe government initially tried to attract FDI and multinational corporations into the Nigerian mining sector. It redefined its role from owner-operator to administrator-regulator.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet, investments did not pour in from abroad. Despite high commodity prices and a concerted effort by the government, not a single major mining company invested in Nigeria and only a few junior companies did. Foreign investors and companies continue to perceive the market as unsafe and challenging,\u201d it added.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Uche Ogar, admitted in 2021 that Nigeria lost over $5 billion through illegal smuggling of gold between 2012 and 2018.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), over $9 billion is lost every other year as a result of illegal mining activities in the country.\n\nLast year, market researchers at CSL Stockbrokers warned that illegal mining activities had continued to wipe gains in the sector.\n\nThey said, \u201cDespite the endowment of mineral resources in Nigeria, the solid minerals sector has significantly underperformed with a meagre contribution of less than one percent to the GDP over the years.\n\n\u201cThe figure is, however, solely from formal channels as the artisanal and small-scale mining activities that constitute over 80 percent of the current mining activities in the country are unaccounted for.\u201d\n\nThis is where Nigeria\u2019s mining problem lies. Nigerians, noted the Capstone report, have practised informal artisanal mining for centuries.\n\nIt said, \u201cToday, the activity is largely poverty-driven and supports the livelihoods of at least 500,000 people. Partly due to its informality, artisanal mining is associated with many negative externalities such as environmental degradation, crime and health hazards.\n\n\u201cOne tragic example is the 2010 lead poisoning outbreak in Nigeria\u2019s northwestern Zamfara State, which killed approximately 400 children and has affected thousands more.\u201d\n\nMaurice Ogbonna, a senior research consultant with the Pretoria-based Institute of Security Studies, said the rise in illegal mining \u201chighlights fundamental social, institutional and structural problems in Nigeria\u2019s governance system.\n\n\u201cIt reveals the prevailing socio-economic problems in the region, especially the inadequate responses to poverty and poor service delivery by the state,\u201d he added.\n\nAcross the country, large-scale illegal mining and small-scale artisanal mining dot the nation\u2019s landscape.\n\n\u201cIt is a sectoral landscape characterised by extreme corruption,\u201d an official of the Mining Cadastre Office in Abuja, the country\u2019s capital, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe Mining Cadastral Office is responsible for the issuance of mining titles/rights. It is also responsible for the promotion of private sector investment in the solid minerals sector, the improvement of the investment climate in the sector and attraction of foreign investors as well as the generation of appropriate revenue for the government.\n\nOutside the premises of the organisation in Lobito Crescent, a coterie of mostly young men parade around. \u201cThey are touts who help people to get mining titles, get coordinates and any information you might want from the Cadastre Office. It is easier and more efficient to deal with them than to deal with the officials of my office,\u201d the official said.\n\nOne of them, who simply identified himself as Paulson, told BusinessDay, \u201cWe work with officials of the Mining Cadastre Office.\n\n\u201cI am a businessman. If you want a mining site for gold, I can get you a correct site. What we do is: we lock down lucrative sites on the cadastral system and make them unavailable.

          "text": "In the 1970s, Nigeria was a recognised global mining destination, with significant production of coal, tin and columbite. However, with the discovery of crude oil in the Niger Delta region, the nation became a major producer of oil and neglected the development of the mining sector.\n\nSome other African countries such as Botswana, Ghana and South Africa have been able to push ahead with the development of their mineral resources since then, leaving Nigeria behind.\n\nBotswana\n\nA small economy with abundant diamond resources, Botswana has gained a reputation for its remarkable economic growth and prudent macroeconomic management. The country\u2019s good governance has enabled the resources to be put to growth-enhancing and development uses.\n\nThe mining sector accounts for about 35 percent of the country\u2019s GDP, with diamonds contributing about 94 per cent of the total mining share in GDP. Botswana produces the world\u2019s largest gem\n\ndiamonds, with an output that represents about 40 percent of the total world output.\n\nThe modern era of mining in Botswana began one year after Independence in 1965, when De Beers\n\ndiscovered the first kimberlite pipe after decades of fruitless exploration activity.\n\nIn 1971, the first diamonds were produced at Orapa, followed by copper-nickel production at the Bamangwato Concessions Ltd at Selibe-Phikwe several years later. Debswana Diamond Company, a 50/50 joint venture between De Beers Consolidated Mines and the Government of the Republic of Botswana, is the largest contributor to the national treasury.\n\nBotswana\u2019s GDP has been growing at about seven percent since diamonds were produced and has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Without the diamond trade, Botswana would lose approximately $500 million in export revenue per year.\n\nThe mining industry as a whole has provided the greatest contribution of all industrial sectors to GDP since the early 1980s, ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent. The industry contributes significantly to the country\u2019s financial reserves, and provides 3.2 percent of formal employment.\n\nA 2016 World Bank review of the sector showed, among other things, that performance across the minerals value chain was better in the latter stages and the country\u2019s mining policy and legal framework were largely sound.\n\nIn addition, the review noted that \u201cthe environmental protection legislation is quite current and mostly based on \u2018good practice\u2019 except in areas where greater efforts needed to be made to ensure that Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are accessible and interactive throughout the mining lifecycle.\u201d\n\nGhana\n\nThe mining sector contributes 37 percent of export revenues and 19 percent of all direct tax payments in Ghana. Gold is the most commercially exploited mineral in Ghana, accounting for about 95 percent of the country\u2019s mineral revenue.\n\nGhana\u2019s mining and quarrying sectors contribution to domestic tax receipts increased from 14.2 percent in 2018 to 18.3 percent in 2019. Gold mining accounts for 10 percent of national GDP.\n\nThe country is one of the top 10 gold producers, accounting for around three percent of global gold output.\n\nThe country\u2019s gold mining sector is one of the oldest in Africa, and retains a crucial role in the Ghanaian economy. In 2019, gold exports were valued at $10.8 billion, comprising 50 percent of all merchandise exports.\n\nA data firm, Statista, noted that in 2020, Ghana\u2019s receipts from minerals represented 48.4 percent of the country\u2019s total exports. In the previous year, 43 percent of the export receipts were from minerals.\n\nRead also: Mining sector\u2019s contribution to GDP remains low despite potentials \u2013 Minister\n\nGold generated the highest income in Ghana, compared to other minerals. The mineral fetched the country over $7.1 billion that year. \u201cMoreover, revenue accumulated from manganese and bauxite added up to around $142 million and $38 million, respectively. Overall, Ghana\u2019s receipts from minerals covered 48.4 percent of its total exports in 2020,\u201d it added.\n\nGhana\u2019s gold mining sector scored 69 out of 100 points in the 2021 Resource Governance Index (RGI), improving by 13 points since the 2017 RGI. Stronger resource governance was driven by improvements across both the index\u2019s value realisation and revenue management components, with notable increases in governance of local impacts and national budgeting.\n\nThe RGI report showed that while governance of taxation and local impacts had improved, contract and beneficial ownership disclosures required attention. The report found that while management of mining revenues had improved with the adoption of new fiscal laws, revenue sharing mechanisms remained poor, with the country having poor scores in open data in the extractive sector.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThe mining industry has been a driving force of the South African economy for the last 150 years. Since the discovery of diamonds in 1867 and subsequently of gold, the mineral sector has contributed to making South Africa the most advanced economy in Africa.\n\nToday, despite growing economic challenges, South Africa is a well-established global player, both in the value of its mineral endowments, and in terms of industries and suppliers.\n\nStatistics from the South African\n\nDepartment of Mineral Resources and the US Geological Survey indicate that South Africa possesses ore reserves amounting to over $2.5 trillion, with 16 commodities ranked in the top 10 internationally.\n\nSouth Africa has the largest known reserves of platinum-group metals (PGMs, 88 percent), manganese (80 percent), chromite (72 percent) and gold (13 percent) in the world. It is ranked second in titanium minerals (10 percent), zirconium (25 percent), vanadium (32 percent), vermiculite (40 percent) and fluorspar (17 percent). In addition, the country is home to 17 percent of the world\u2019s antimony reserves.\n\nSouth Africa is currently ranked 5th internationally in terms of mining contribution to GDP and the country is ranked in the top three globally in terms of production of PGMs (59 percent), vanadium (25 percent), ferrochrome (39 percent), alumino-silicates (60 percent), vermiculite (35 percent), zirconium (32 percent), titanium minerals (19 percent), manganese ore (17 percent) and antimony (two percent), with its gold (eight percent), coal (four percent), iron ore (four percent), ferro-silicon, silicon metal and fluorspar ranked in the top 10 globally. PGMs, Gold, Iron ore and Coal alone account for 82% of sales and 38% (R282 billion) of exports.\n\nThe relative share of the mining sector has declined in the last 20 years for a number of reasons. First, the South African economy is well diversified and the growth of secondary and tertiary industries have, over time, dwarfed the contribution of the mining sector to the overall economy.\n\nData from Statista show that in 2019, the mining sector in South Africa contributed with an added value of approximately 226.2 billion South African Rand (roughly $13.5 billion) to the country\u2019s GDP. The amount decreased by roughly two percent in comparison to the previous year.\n\nAs of 2018, the mining industry added approximately 230.5 billion Rand (around $13.7 billion) to the GDP.\n\nAs of 2021, the distribution of the market capitalisation of mineral commodities in South Africa, by mineral, showed that platinum accounted for a 65 percent share of the market capitalisation of mineral commodities in South Africa.\n\nYet illegal mining is prevalent and thriving in the country. A 2020 Voice of America investigation showed that illegal mining in South Africa was among the most lucrative on the continent, pushing miners to risk health and safety in mostly abandoned shafts. But the chance to strike it rich drives the miners, who are often armed to defend their illegal claims.",

So, the one (pupil) that wants to go to TVET can go to.\n\n\u201cIf they go to TVET, that doesn\u2019t mean that is where their education stops; they can decide on to read medicine; they can decide on to go to Polytechnic.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We just want to ensure the basic education as stipulated by the 2004 UBE Act is first 10 years of education is free and compulsory.\n\n\u201cSo, by the time a student is graduating from JSS 3, we want them not only to be literate and numerate, we also want them to be skilled.\n\n\u201cSo, by the time we are able to do that, Edo is going to be far ahead of everybody else,\u201d she said.\n\nThe commissioner added that the state was in the process of formalising the informal skilled sector in the state.\n\nShe noted that going forward, the state would ensure that all electricians, plumbers, welders and tailors among other artisans operating in the state, work in line with the guidelines of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\n\u201cSo, for our informal apprenticeship sector, we want to link that with our adult education system.\n\n\u201cIf you are already an artisan; a master craftsperson, but you don\u2019t know how to read, we can send you to our adult education school; it is free. That is for those who are already established.\n\n\u201cFor new apprenticeship that will be coming into the system, we are now going to say you must know how to read and write,\u201d said the commissioner.\n\nThis mainstreaming of skilled acquisition, technical and vocational studies, she explained would be extended to schools for Special Needs in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, mainstreaming skilled acquisition, technical and vocational is not just in our regular schools, the governor has mandated that we should extend to our Special Needs schools.\n\n\u201cWe want to train the next generation of differently able learners to be self sufficient.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to raise the next generation of differently able people who grow up and we acculturate them to become beggars.\n\n\u201cThe world has advanced to the stage that almost everybody can be self sufficient, if they put their minds to it,\u201d she said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Gov. Soludo\u2019s day in the Sun",
          "text": "Thursday March 17, 2022, marked a major milestone in the life of Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo, former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria; the development quest of Anambra state, and the political aspirations of the Igbo nation. On this day, Soludo, having won the November 6, 2021 governorship election with a huge landslide, was inaugurated as governor.\n\nSince coming into political limelight under former president Obasanjo\u2019s administration, first as Chief Economic Adviser, and subsequently governor of the CBN, Soludo had shown like a thousand stars with his captivating eloquence and disarming brilliance. He had projected his fervent desire to set the country on the path to sustainable economic and social development, which has unfortunately continued to elude the national over time.\n\nSoludo is Anambra state\u2019s sixth governor since 1999, and perhaps, the most aspiring of collective hope by the state in particular and NdiIgbo generally. He is one candidate, for the first, not only in the state but the entire region, with a consensus approval of the people cutting across bbo best chance for the presidency.\n\nHe came to office prepared, unlike our common tradition, hit the ground running, and committed to a personal governance manifesto beside that of government, which demands subjection of power to the will and mandate of the people. His five point agenda for governance include security, industrial and technology hub, good governance, etc. Listening to him deliver the inauguration address raised the nostalgia of how leadership can change the course of history.\n\nSoludo has big ideas for the state and the Southeast;, no doubt about that; the challenge now is to make them happen. He had said in the address: \u201cOur contract with Anambra people derives from three seminal documents: (a) \u201cAnambra Vision 2070\u2014a 50-Year Development Plan\u201d which I chaired the drafting; (b) \u201cThe Soludo Solution: A People\u2019s Manifesto for a Greater Anambra\u201d; and (c) \u201cThe Transition Committee (Combined) Report\u201d\u2014which built upon the first two.\n\n\u201cIn sum, this is an agenda for an itinerant tribe in search of a livable and prosperous homeland. Driven by the philosophy of One Anambra, One People, One Agenda, our goal is to build Anambra into a livable and prosperous smart megacity. We aim to transit beyond petroleum into the digital world of the 4th Industrial Revolution, and envision Anambra as an industrial, technology, and leisure/entertainment hub of West Africa.\n\n\u201cOur detailed Plan rests on five key pillars: law and order (homeland peace and security); economic transformation as Nigeria\u2019s next axis of industrial-tech and leisure; competitive and progressive social agenda (education, health, youth, women and vulnerable groups); Governance, rule of law and a rebirth of our value system; and aggressively tackling our existential threat posed by the environment\u2014towards a clean, green, planned and sustainable cities, communities, and markets\u2026.\u201d\n\nThis vision raises much hope for both Anambra and the region. His vision goes beyond the state and governance and challenges one of the most dysfunctional traits of Igbo politics; visionary leadership, which other people are now taking advantage of. Since the great Zik and his immediate successors, particularly after the war, Igbo have lost their sense of purpose and place in history. Everything about their world view seems to revolve around money.\n\nThis has largely constrained their influence in politics as they were ready for sale to the highest bidder. Mr. Peter Obi had great promised but his limited vision of leadership which focus on governance alone to the exclusion of politics vitiated his relevance. APGA, as a party is the only pan Igbo party in Nigeria founded to give the people a platform in national politics, as did AD which gave the Yoruba presidency in 1999.\n\nBut it has failed in the task to galvanize the Igbo for national leadership. Its inability to push beyond Anambra has reduced it to a state party rather a regional and national party, a money making venture for the few with access to it. The Igbo need good leadership and all eyes are on Soludo. Most likely, the presidency will still elude them because they have failed to organize and their voice and unity is in question.\n\nSoludo must walk the talk and fill this yawning vacuum. Time for speeches is over. APGA must move beyond Anambra to other Igbo states. To do this, it must first reform itself to be more inclusive of others too. Otherwise, its future is in jeopardy. Soludo must provide Anambra with good governance; but he must also take the Igbo a step further into national politics. He must regain the momentum from where Dim Ojukwu left it. We are waiting.",

          "title": "The Big scam: Fresh doubts over NNPC\u2019s 75 million per day consumption figures",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nExperts in the financial and petroleum sector as well as exhaustive data obtained by Business Hallmark have exposed the fuel subsidy regime as a huge scam.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had put the average daily consumption of petrol at 75 million litres per day.\n\nBased on an average 75 daily consumption estimate, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had in January 2022 approved the sum of N3 trillion for the new subsidy regime.\n\nThe N3 trillion fuel subsidy budget amounts to 17.5 per cent of the total 2022 budget of N17.126 trillion which has a deficit of N6.39 trillion (37% of the N17.126 trillion national budget).\n\nAlso, the N3 trillion subsidy budget is 55% and 43% of the capital component and recurrent expenditure of the 2022 budget, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC had never provided any methodology on how it arrived at the fuel consumption rates it employs to determine the subsidy bill it usually presents to the Federal Government.\n\nAlso, all the regulatory agencies in the petroleum sections have never agreed on the actual petrol consumed in the country with each presenting contrasting figures.\n\nFor instance, in 2020, the now defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) put the fuel consumption figure consumed daily at 38 million litres daily, while the Ministry of Petroleum Resources presented a slightly higher figure of 52 million litres daily consumption.\n\nMeanwhile, the conservative figures presented by the two are not close the that of the NNPC at over 70 million.\n\nBH investigation indicates that that the NNPC\u2019s figure is overstated as the country consumes nothing close to what the corporation had made Nigerians to believe.\n\nJustifying the overbloated figure, the Group Managing Director (GMD), Mele Kyari, had during a presentation at an interactive session by the Joint Senate Committee on the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper, among several reasons, blamed the high consumption figure on smuggling.\n\nAccording to him, with a price difference of over N100 per litre between what is sold in Nigeria and in countries bordering the nation, it was difficult to cage the activities of petrol smugglers..\n\n\u201cWe all know that our daily consumption is not up to 60 million litres. We all know that, and that is why we have to pull it down. We will pull it down by every means necessary.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is arbitrage between the price that you sell and what is obtainable elsewhere, you can be sure that it is very difficult to contain the situation,\u201d Kyari had explained.\n\nAlso, sources in NNPC put the percentage of petroleum products smuggled across the borders into neighbouring countries at between 40% to 50%.\n\nThough, BH investigation revealed that a large quantity of Nigerian fuel is been smuggled across the borders to neighbouring countries, the figure mentioned by the NNPC is largely bloated and unrealistic.\n\nFor instance, the latest United Nations estimates of the population of the 16 West African nations of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania,\n\nNiger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo as well as Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha as of Friday, March 18, 2022, is 419,365,080, with Nigeria accounting for 215,222,606 which is more than half of the figure.\n\nSome population experts who faulted NNPC\u2019s fuel consumption figure of over 70 million litres unanimously agreed to go with the lesser figures presented by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the defunct DPR.\n\n\u201cIf we take the average of 38 and 52 million figures presented by the DPR and the petroleum ministry, we will have about 40 million litres consumption rate.\n\n\u201cLet us now assume that Nigerians consume the DPR and petroleum ministry\u2019s average of 40 million litres, leaving the over 30 million left to the remaining 15 West African countries, we can see that there is something fundamentally wrong with the NNPC figure.\n\n\u201cI said this because our fuel is not smuggled to all the 15 other countries in the region but only to Benin Republic, Cameroun, Niger Republic, Chad and probably Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe population of the five countries is around 100 million. Assuming they rely 100% on Nigerian fuel, they should be consuming about a quarter of what we consume in Nigeria. That is another 20 million litters.\n\n\u201cIf you add that to the 40 million average of DPR and the ministry of petroleum, we should have about 60 million litres. And this is for all the 6 countries. So how did NNPC arrived at its own figure of over 70 million?\u201d demanded Dr. Rasheed Adegoke, a lecturer at the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, Osun State Polytecnic, Esa-Oke.\n\nThe United Nations put the estimated population of Benin Republic at 12.72 million,Togo 8.48 million persons, Niger Republic 24.96 million, Chad 17.32 million, Cameroun 27.2 million and Ghana 31,732,129 as of March 2022.\n\nBased on the UN\u2019s projections, the population of the 5 West African countries came to 122.34 million. Added to Nigeria\u2019s 215million people, the figure rises to 337.58 million.\n\n\u201cCan you now see my argument? If the whole population of West African people estimated at 419,365,080 consume about 60 million litres, how can just six countries of just 337.58 million consume over 70 million litres\u201d, Dr. Adegoke elaborated.\n\nA data released by the now defunct Department of Petroleum Resources, though unintentionally, picked holes in NNPC\u2019s high fuel consumption figure.\n\nA critical review of the data suggest that Nigerian fuel marketers load more petrol than their current distribution capacity.\n\nFor instance, A.A RANO Nigeria Limited with less than 100 filling stations nationwide lifted 115.4 million litres of petrol in June 2021, while A.Y.M Shafa Limited, a petroleum firm with less than 100 filling stations lifted 89.2 million litres of petrol in the same period.\n\nSimilarly, Matrix Energy which has less than 60 filling stations, lifted as high as 123.6 million litres of petrol in June 2021.\n\nIn contrast, Total Nigeria Plc, a multinational oil company with an extensive distribution network of over 570 service stations nationwide, lifted 24.3 million litres of petrol in the same period under review.\n\nThe data practicality confirms the fact that the nations lacks the distribution network to handle over 70 million litres pf petrol daily, practically tearing to pieces NNPC\u2019s consumption figure.\n\nAnother revealing aspect of the data is the revelation that 18 states consume same amount of petrol as Lagos, the most industrialised and populated state in the country.\n\nAccording to the data, while Lagos, with all the homes, small and medium scale enterprises that rely heavily on petrol powered generators for electricity, as well as the notorious traffick logjams on its ever busy roads which made vehicles consume more fuel consumed 430 million litres in June 2021, 16 states, including economically backward states of Yobe Bauchi and Jigawa also consumed a combined total of 397.3 million litres per in the same June.\n\nAccording to JCDecaux Grace Lake Nigeria, the biggest outdoor advertising firm in the world, the over 5 million private vehicles and 200,000 commercial vehicles in Lagos State get stuck in the same spot for an average of 4.2 hours every day and 30 hours every week owing to population explosion and under-utilised waterways which ensure that the state roads are always locked up in traffick.\n\nThe advertising firm further explained that on the average, Lagos records 227 vehicles per kilometre of road daily, more than the national average of about 11.\n\nThe Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) put the number of registered vehicles in the whole country at of the 4th quarter of 2018 at 11.8 million, with Lagos accounting for about half of the figure.\n\n\u201cSo, it is practically impossible for other states with less population, businesses and vehicles to be competing with Lagos in the area of fuel consumption.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that the figure bandied by the NNPC is largely false\u201d.\n\nA state-by-state comparison pointed to the farce called petrol subsidy. For instance, Zamfara, a banditry ravaged state, consumed 77.2 million litres, while a more industrialised Anambra consumed an average of 68.8 million litres in the same month of June.\n\nLikewise, while Adamawa State consumed 68.8 million litres of petrol for the month of June, a more commercially vibrant state, Ondo, only consumed 59.6 million litres same period.\n\nIn the area of petrol tankers deliveries to states, the industry report shows that the number of petrol trucks that delivered fuel to border states are higher than states with higher IGR.\n\nFor instance, in the month under review, Adamawa State received 1,501 petrol trucks while Abia State, which host international markets like the Aba and Ariara Markets, received only 1,026 trucks.\n\nAnother state in the savannah with virtually no economic activities, Zamfara, received 1,699 petrol trucks while a much-industrialised Anambra recorded 1,218 trucks.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s subsidy regime is quiet murky.

          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nThe success stories of how Nigeria\u2019s young, bold and audacious entrepreneurs currently making waves in the tech space broke the ceiling is quite awe-inspiring. Like the tech mavericks of Silicon Valley, these young digital visionaries have upended the old business tradition laid out previous generations as the ordained path to great wealth.\n\nWhile most of their contemporaries spend their youth hunting for jobs or honing work skills in entry-level jobs, they had already joined the millionaires league by making things happen around them through thoughtful thinking, beliefs, and choices.\n\nBarely in their 30s and 40s, they had demonstrated innovative and entrepreneurial skills, as well as management capabilities to redefine the rules. Since their entry into the scene, they have remained relevant in the fast evolving space.\n\nFrom Piggyvest to Flutterwave, Jobberman, 54gene, Kobo360, Paga, eTransact and many others, the founders of these emerging brand names had transformed fantastic ideas into business success by exerting themselves to make it a reality.\n\nIn this report, Business Hallmark features some of Nigeria\u2019s tech savvy entrepreneurs and how their brands are currently making waves.\n\nJobberman.\n\nUnarguably Nigeria\u2019s No. 1 recruitment website with over 2.5 million job applicants and 60,000 employers nationwide, Jobberman was founded in August 2009 by the trio of Olalekan Olude, Ayodeji Adewunmi and Opeyemi Awoyemi, then students of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) in Osun State right inside their hostel rooms.\n\nAccording to one of the founders, Olalekan Olude, the website was set up to help connect people looking for jobs with companies looking for hands.\n\nBy 2010, the firm which was funded by stipends from its founders had become so large that the team entered into a partnership with Tiger Global Management in August 2010 to help secure a \u2018Series A\u2019 financing and investment in the business. It is currently worth over $100million (N5 billion).\n\nAn impressed Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, had named the founders \u201cas examples of young Nigerians using digital technology to make impact across Africa.\n\nBH reliably gathered that the site which is ranked the 48th most visited site in Nigeria and receives 5,000 job applications daily has been fully acquired by One Africa Media.\n\nFlutterwave\n\nAnother Nigerian startup making waves is Flutterwave. Founded in 2016 by the duo of Olugbenga Agboola and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji as a Nigerian platform, the firm has grown to become an Africa-wide payments platform, connecting all payment types in the continent and bringing a single-use payment solution to merchants and small businesses.\n\nThe technology deployed by the firm allows business owners to accept payments from customers without worrying about compliance requirements, infrastructure technology, or having to deal with multiple payment providers.\n\nWith the Flutterwave platform, businesses can accept payments from anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cAfrica needs three major things, logistics, payments, and commerce. Flutterwave is taking care of the fragmented payment system in Africa. The fragmented system needs a central means of payment to facilitate commerce within the continent. That is what Flutterwave is out to do,\u201d declared Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who served as the first CEO of the company from inception to 2018.\n\nThe co-founder, Agboola, who served as the Chief Technical Officer until October 2018 is now the company\u2019s CEO. In 2020, Fortune magazine listed one of the founders, Agboola, in its popular yearly Under 40 list which recognises 40 individuals who are below the age of 40 and are considered to be influential leaders in their respective fields.\n\nAgboola, who graduated from the prestigious MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management with experiences at PayPal and Google has helped shape the fintech space in Nigeria since co-founding Flutterwave.\n\nThe company is currently Africa\u2019s most valued startup with a valuation of $3 billion after it raised $250 million from a Series D funding round in February 2022.\n\nUsing an exchange rate of N570 to one United States\u2019 dollar, Flutterwave\u2019s valuation is about N1.71 trillion, more valuable than Nestle Nigeria, ZENITH and GTCO, the two most valuable banks on the NGX.\n\n54gene\n\nAnother young Nigerian with a Midas touch is Abasi Ene-Obong, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of 54gene, an health startup that uses human genetic data derived from diverse African populations to improve medical products in the continent.\n\nFounded in 2019, the startup rode on the wave of the novel Covid19 pandemic to success by researching, developing and coordinating the country\u2019s fight against Covid19. The biotechnology firm\u2019s laboratories were among the first privately owned facilities to test for Covid19 in the country.\n\nNot surprisingly, the firm has attracted $20 million (N10 billion) in funding from Silicon Valley venture capitalists who are betting big on the yet unexplored African genome. In less than three years in existence, the firm has expanded its biobank capabilities from around 50,000 to 200,000 samples.\n\nAs expected, several honours have come the way of the 32 years old Ene-Obong. In 2021, she was recognised by Fast Company as one of the most innovative companies in Africa. She was also named by Fortune magazine in its 2021 Under 40 list. According to the magazine, the 32-year-old founder had spurred the biotech revolution in Africa and one of the reasons she was selected was because of her company\u2019s exploits during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAs with many companies, COVID-19 has brought some change. When the crisis started, 54gene provided equipment to public labs in Nigeria, as well as testing, setting up molecular diagnostic labs across states within the country,\u201d the magazine had explained.\n\nKobo360\n\nAlso on the list is Kobo360, a tech-enabled logistics startup that aggregates end-to-end haulage operations to help cargo owners, truck owners, and drivers, and cargo recipients to achieve an efficient supply chain framework. It is more of a Uber-like platform that connects truck owners and drivers with cargo companies aiming to make supply chains more efficient, affordable and transparent.\n\nFounded by Obi Ozor and Ife Oyedele, the company uses big data and technology through an all-in-one robust logistics ecosystem to reduce logistics frictions.\n\nAccording to one of the founders, Obi Ozor, the idea to float Kobo 360 came after he experienced the slow movement of cargo first-hand some years back when he was importing diapers and hauling them across the country.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s logistics is very informal, making it challenging for many businesses to move goods efficiently. There\u2019s a serious disconnect between getting goods from A to B.\n\n\u201cIt used to take one week to transport goods 1,000 km, from Lagos to Kano\u201d, Ozor had stated.\n\nWith Kobo360, cargo companies can choose a company online instead of having to visit a truck park to find a driver. The moment a deal is consumated, drivers receive half of their payment immediately. Drivers are charged between 5% and 10% of their fee for linking them with goods for their return journey.\n\nBy providing drivers with information about weather and traffic conditions and matching them directly with companies, Kobo360 has been able to cut the time for a 1,000 km journey down from one week to two to three days.\n\nThe company works with 50,000 truck drivers in Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, Kenya and Uganda to help them transport over one billion kilos of goods, worth an estimated $250 billion yearly. Procter & Gamble (PG), Unilever (UL) and Maersk are among the leading companies that use the Kobo 360 platform.\n\nThe firm has raised around $40 million (N20 billion) in funds. In 2020, it raised $30m from Goldman Sachs to build out its blockchain-enabled Global Logistics Operating System (GLOS) so that it could transition to more supply chain services.\n\nOne of the founders, Ozor, is also on the list of Fortune\u2019s 2020 Under 40 achievers. He was recognised for spearheading the company\u2019s growth as CEO as well as his efforts in trying to digitise an age-long offline industry and providing innovative solutions.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ozor who is a member of the Endeavor network, has been able to lead the company effectively as it navigates around challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nPiggyvest\n\nFounded in 2015 by three friends, Somto Ifezue, Odunayo Eweniyi and Joshua Chibueze, Piggyvest is Nigeria\u2019s biggest automated savings platform that helps customers invest spare money with promises of interest rates.\n\nCurrently in their 30s, the trio are epitome of resilience and perseverance. Between them, they had founded and managed eight failed businesses before they hit gold with Piggyvest.\n\nWithin a year of its existence (December 2015 to December 2016), the firm helped about 450 users save \u20a621 million through Twitter-enabled bootstrapping. with next to nothing spent on marketing, according to Eweniyi, one of the founders and the company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer.\n\nWith continuous improvement, Piggyvest has grown to become a globally recognised innovative company. In spite the coronavirus pandemic, the ended 2019 with a million users who saved about $80 million. It presently has over 3 million users.\n\nThe company\u2019s last funding round was in May 2018, with a $1.1m seed fund led by LeadPath Nigeria, with participation from Village Capital and Ventures Platform. The fund was used to acquire a microfinance bank license.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nThe \u2018planned\u2019 acquisition of SIAT Nigeria Limited (SNL) by Presco Nigeria Pls., a leading palm-oil processing firm listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, is currently generating controversy in the industry, Business Hallmark can reliably reveal.\n\nThe board of the palm-oil processing firm, it would be recalled, had in June 2021, informed its shareholders, The Nigerian Exchange Group and the investing public it planned to expand its business by acquiring 100% shares of an existing private company limited by shares and in the same line of business with the company. It however failed to declare the identity of the company.\n\nHowever, on March 8, 2022, Presco publicly revealed the identity of the company it intended to take over as SIAT Nigeria Limited (SNL), a private company that also operates in the agricultural sector, for N23 billion cash. According to the firm\u2019s management, the acquisition will allow it to merge with SNL, which will then unlock opportunities in the combined entities.\n\nIt futher projects that the benefit of acquiring SNL would lead to combined earnings per share of N25.9 by 2025 as against the current N18.6.\n\nThe market responsed to the news, with a share of Presco which opened on the trading floor of the NGX at N104.5 on March 9, 2022, closing at N114.95, a 52-week high at the end of the day\u2019s trading. The firm is currently the 22nd most valuable stock on the NGX, closing its last trading day (Friday, March 18, 2022) at N133.00 per share.\n\nAccording to BH checks, Presco began 2022 with a share price of N87.80, meaning it has gained 51.5% since the beginning of the year, ranking it sixth on the NGX in terms of year-to-date performance. Industry stakeholders who spoke with our correspondent on the development attributed the continued price appreciation to the \u2018planned\u2019 acquisition of SNL by the palm oil processing giant.\n\nDetails of the deal obtained by BH include the acquisition of SNL\u2019s assets, including Risonpalm, a 16,000 hectares of old palm plantations, as well as the entire social and industrial infrastructure of the industrial oil palm complex from the Rivers State Government for N200 billion.\n\nHowever, controversies, particularly that of lack of corporate governance, have continued to trail the purchase. The controversy is being fuelled by the 2021 full-year results just released by Presco which revealed that the acquisition deal had been concluded and the sum of N23 billion already paid for the acquisition of SNL without the approval of shareholders.\n\nIn the balance sheets, SNL was included as Presco\u2019s investment asset. While the 2021 full year report showed that the acquisition process had already been concluded, the company meanwhile is now asking for the approval of shareholders to sanction the deal.\n\n\u201cIn line with the requirements of the NGX on related party transactions, SIAT SA, the core shareholder of SNL and a significant shareholder in Presco, will not be voting on the resolutions to approve the acquisition. To this end, the decision to proceed with the acquisition will be made by the minority shareholders of Presco.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Presco having considered the terms and conditions of the acquisition, as well as the benefit thereof, recommend that you (shareholders) vote in favour of the special resolutions which will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)\u201d, parts of the statement read.\n\nWhat this means is that neither the SNL, owned 100% by SIAT Group, the parent company of Presco Plc which owns 60% of Presco, nor the minority shareholders who own the remaining 40 percent shares did not ratified the sale before money exchanged hand.\n\n\u2018Who then signed off on the deal\u2019, is the question on the lips of many aggrieved shareholders who spoke with our correspondent.\n\n\u201cIf the SIAT Group which owns 60% of Presco is not eligible to vote, according to NGX requirement, who then consumated the deal when minority shareholders with the remaining 40% stake are just being lobbied to sign off on the deal at the next AGM?\n\n\u201cThe whole process (acquisition) reeks of corruption. It has created new challenges from operational, regulatory and compliance perspectives.\n\n\u201cAs I see it, this request for shareholders to approve the proposal is merely a request to rubber-stamp a deed that had already been carried out.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point of seeking minority shareholders\u2019 approval for a transaction that insiders in the company have already consummated?\n\n\u201cWhere is corporate governance in all these? A systemic failure of corporate governance is also a failure of the whole set of regulatory, market, stakeholder, and internal governance.\n\n\u201cBusiness managers must ensure they remain disciplined, transparent, independent, accountable for their actions\u201d, said a minority shareholder who did not want his identity disclosed for fear of intimidation.\n\nAnother interested party who spoke with our correspondent noted that the deal would normally have been a good one for shareholders to approve, only that they were not carried along in the process.\n\n\u201cWhat are they hiding from us? Normally, it should be a welcome development as it is going to be a win-win situation for everyone.\n\n\u201cBut the way it was carried out leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Why should they ask for our ratification when the deed has already been done?\n\n\u201cIt is an insult and an unforgivable slight. Despite the fact that the transation favours us, the worry of most shareholders is that if they can do this without any regulatory approval, they can as well undermine our interest and get away with it\u201d, declared another worried shareholder.\n\nAnother issue that is bothering stakeholders is the ownership structure of Presco and the undue influence by its majority shareholder.\n\nA cursory look at the ownership structure of Presco shows that the SNL which was recently acquired by Presco is wholly owned by the SIAT Group, the parent company of Presco which in turn owns 60% shares in Presco. According to NGX laws, SIAT, being a related party to the companies in the deal (owns 60% shares in Presco), is not expected to vote when the approval is tabled to shareholders.\n\nHowever, the decision to sell had been reached with the whole deal consummated only by SIAT, the majority shareholder of Presco. This, worried shareholders stated, raised the question of regulatory failure on the part of the NGX.\n\nSome of the minority shareholders who agreed to talk to BH questioned the role played by the industry regulator, the Nigerian Exchange Group and Stanbic IBTC Pensions, a major minority shareholder with 7% stake in Presco in the deal.\n\n\u201cIf there is nothing sinister behind the transaction, why should it be consumated in secret? Let\u2019s just hope that the NGX and Stanbic IBTC Pensions Nigerian Exchange Group will do the needful by addressing this glaring anomaly in order to douse the fears of smaller shareholders like us\u201d, a concerned stakeholder advised.",

          "title": "Amid renewed Imo sit-at-home order, Buhari takes fresh steps over security situation in Southeast, summons Uzodinma",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to review the security situation in the South-east.\n\nThis, the president said, was with a view to ending spate of criminal activities across the region in recent time.\n\nThis is coming amid the renewed order for the enforcement of the sit-at-home among residents in Owerri, the state capital.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media Garba Shehu announced this in a statement Monday.\n\nThe statement also said Buhari would meet with the Imo state governor, Hope Uzodinma, as well as Minister of Power Abubakar Aliyu, and the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, Prof. Doyin Salami.\n\nShehu said the president would meet with them separately and be briefed on the latest developments in Imo state, the power sector and the state of the economy.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that the President while condemning the spate of violence in Imo State in the aftermath of the destruction of buildings and assets of the Police and the home of Prof. George Obiozor, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, pledged to review the security situation in southeast Nigeria,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIn the aftermath of the arson on the home of the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. Obiozor, Buhari had condemned the spate of violence in Imo state which has seen the destruction of buildings and assets of the police.\n\nThe president had also expressed concern over frequent power outages, apologising to Nigerians and assuring of prompt solution to the challenges.\n\nHe explained that it was caused by a drastic decline in hydroelectric generation due to seasonal pressure, technical and supply problems at the country\u2019s thermal stations.\n\nBuhari also noted that another major cause of the grid failures was low gas power generation due to vandalisation of gas pipelines.\n\nSit-at-home resumes in Imo\n\nMeanwhile, more than six months after Imo residents, especially those living in Owerri, the state capital, stopped observing the mandatory Monday sit-at-home, the exercise has resumed in earnest.\n\nThis followed the deadly attacks at the weekend which saw the Umuguma Police station in Owerri West razed, with two policemen dead and vehicles destroyed.\n\nAlso, there was a repeated attack on Omuma, Oru East Police station and the unexpected attack on the country home of Ohanaeze Ndigbo President General, Prof George Obiozor in Awommama, Oru East local government area of the state.\n\nIt was also gathered that a memo on the enforcement of Monday sit-at-home was circulated around the state by a yet-to-be identified group, making it an offence for Imo residents to come out on Mondays.\n\nBlueprint correspondent who went round the capital city, gathered that commercial banks, markets, shopping malls were shut, while primary and secondary school pupils who went to school in the morning, were later asked to go back home. Also, a few vehicles were seen on the roads as a result of residents\u2019 compliance.\n\nAttack on Obiozor\u2019s residence daring \u2013 Atiku\n\nSimilarly, the 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has condemned the attack on the Imo state residence of the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo.\n\nAtiku, in a press release by his media office in Abuja Monday, said the attack \u201cwas daring and obnoxious.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the former Vice President, this attack further reinforces the need to firm up security across the country as a situation where elder statesmen become targets of incendiary attacks is inexcusable.\n\n\u201cThe statement expresses sympathy with the President-General of the pan-Igbo socio-cultural group, Obiozor and his family and calls on relevant law enforcement operatives to step up investigations in order to apprehend the assailants and bring them to justice,\u201d it said.\n\nMonarch, 19 others killed in Zamfara\n\nIn a related development, about 21 persons, including the village head, were killed by terrorists in Ganar-Kiyawa village of Adabka District, Bukkuyum local government area of Zamfara state\n\nThe latest attack happened Sunday morning at about 8:30 am when the gunmen stormed the community and started shooting sporadically.\n\nAccording to Channels Television, the bandits also attacked some surrounding villages, looted shops, and carted away some valuables.\n\n\n\n\n\nA source from the area who spoke on condition of anonymity said communities under Adabka ward had been witnessing a series of attacks and abductions from the bandits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s (Sunday) attack was a major one; they have been coming almost on a daily basis to abduct people, majorly women, and children,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said residents of Ganar Kiyawa have been sleeping in the bush for fear of further attack by the terrorists in their homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the response of security agencies, he said the military was only stationed at Adabka and Gwashi town, leaving other villages vulnerable to bandits\u2019 attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe security agencies are not enough to mount all the villages around. We only have a military presence in two major places, Adabka town, and Gwashi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAll other villages around are left uncovered by the security agencies so these people (bandits) can just go out anytime they wish to and attack people,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nPolice authorities in the state have yet to confirm the latest attack.\n\n24-hour curfew in Kaduna LGs\n\nAlso, Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai has declared 24-hour curfew in two local government areas of the state to curb the trend of terrorism in the affected areas.\n\nA statement issued Monday by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the curfew took immediate effect in the two affected councils of Jema\u2019a and Kaura local government areas.\n\nAruwan said the measure was taken by the government following security advice.\n\nGiving reasons for adopting the curfew as a last resort, Aruwan said: \u201cThis is to assist the security agencies to stabilise the situation in the areas, save lives and property and enable the restoration of law and order.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe security agencies in the state have full authorisation to enforce the curfew.\n\n\u201cGovernment appeals to all residents of Jema\u2019a and Kaura LGAs to cooperate with the security agencies in the urgent task of restoring peace and upholding law and order.\n\n\u201cGovernment condemns the violence and all acts of lawlessness that have occurred in the area,\u201d the commissioner added.",

          "text": "A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja Monday declared the seats of 20 lawmakers from Cross River state vacant for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe affected lawmakers defected alongside Governor Ben Ayade to the APC.\n\nA similar judgement was given in favour of PDP against Ebonyi state Governor Dave Umahi, his deputy and the state lawmakers who defected to the APC.\n\nThe trial judge, Justice Taiwo Taiwo, in a judgment, dismissed the defence argument that the PDP (plaintiff) had no locus standi (legal rights) to institute the case.\n\nJustice Taiwo declared that the lawmaker\u2019s argument that there was rancour in the PDP, which necessitated their defection to APC, was a ploy to mislead the court.\n\nThe judge, who granted all the reliefs sought by the PDP, held that it was disheartening that politicians in the country treat citizens as if they do not matter once they get into office.\n\nThe judge said: \u201cWe cannot continue in sin and expect grace to abound.\u201d\n\nTwo members of the House of Representatives and 18 Cross River House of Assembly members were affected by the judgment.\n\nWe\u2018re not aware \u2013 Speaker\n\nIn a reaction, Speaker Cross River House of Assembly Eteng Jonah-Williams said he is not aware of any court judgment sacking him or any member of the House.\n\nJonah-Williams said this Monday in an interview in Calabar.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, I am not aware of any court judgment sacking me or any member because we have not been served with any court order as we speak,\u201d he said.\n\nIn yet another reaction, a PDP lawmaker representing Obubra 2 State Constituency, Francis Ovat, has hailed the judgment as sound.\n\n\u201cIf you are elected into a political party and you hold the people\u2019s mandate, it is wrong for you to jump from one party to the other. Elected officials should learn to stay in one party.\n\n\u201cIf there is any rancour or crisis in their party, they should stay in the party and resolve it. Jumping from one party to the other kills democracy. The judgment is a good one and it came right on time,\u201d Ovat said.\n\nUmahi fails again\n\nAlso, another Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has struck out the motion filed by sacked Governor Umahi, seeking a stay of execution of the March 8 judgment.\n\nThe motion was struck out by Justice Inyang Ekwo after Chukwuma Ma-Chukwu Ume (SAN) to Umahi and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, prayed the court for the withdrawal of the motion.\n\nThe motion for stay of execution was marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/920/21, between PDP Vs INEC and three others.\n\nAt the proceeding Monday, the PDP\u2019s lawyer, Emmanuel Ukala(SAN), did not oppose the application by Ume.\n\nJustice Ekwo had, in a judgment March 8, ordered Umahi; his deputy, Kelechi Igwe and 16 lawmakers to vacate their office and seats, following their defection from the PDP to the APC.\n\nThe judge also directed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately receive from the PDP the names of its candidates to replace the duo.\n\nHowever, on March 10, Governor Umahi and others sought an order of the FHC Abuja, staying the execution of its judgment directing them to vacate their offices over their defection to another political party.\n\nIn a motion on notice filed by Ume, the applicants also prayed the court to stay the execution of its order directing INEC to receive other names in their place or hold a governorship election in accordance with Section 177(c) of the 1999 Constitution, pending the hearing and determination of the appeal dated and filed on March 9 by the appellants, among others.\n\nUme also sought a withdrawal of the stay of execution motion filed on behalf of the lawmakers marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1041 between PDP vs. INEC and 20 others.\n\nAt the resumed hearing, Ume informed the court of his intention to withdraw the two motions for stay of execution dated March 9 on the grounds that an appeal had been entered at the Court of Appeal on the matter.\n\nAnd Ukala, the PDP\u2019s counsel, did not oppose the application.\n\nUme had, on Wednesday, approached the court to withdraw the stay of execution motion filed on Umahi\u2019s behalf due to a mistake in the application.\n\nBut Justice Ekwo had since struck out the matter.\n\nPDP wants INEC\u2019s certificate of return\n\nAnd in a reaction, the PDP has charged INEC to issue Certificates of Return to Hon. Iduma Igariwey and Fred Udogwu as governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi state respectively without delay.\n\nPDP said: \u201cINEC, pursuant to the provision of Section 287(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) which provides that \u201cthe decisions of the Federal High Court, National Industrial Court, a High Court and of all other courts established by this Constitution shall be enforced in any part of the Federation by all authorities and persons, and by other courts of law with subordinate jurisdiction to that of the Federal High Court, National Industrial Court, a High Court and those other courts, respectively\u201d is bound to issue Certificates of Return immediately to Hon. Iduma Igariwey and Fred Udogwu as Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State respectively.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, Monday demanded that the Chief Judge of Ebonyi State, upon the issuance of Certificates of Return by INEC, proceed to swear in Igariwey and Udogwu.\n\nPDP said, \u201cThis is necessary to prevent the existence of vacuum in the government and governance of Ebonyi State as Umahi and Igwe can no longer exercise the functions of the office of Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State pursuant to the Order of the Federal High Court which removed them from office on March 8, 2022 and the subsequent Order of the Federal High Court today, which refused their application for Stay of Execution.\u201d\n\nThe party also commended the judiciary for its courage in defending the Constitution as well as the will of the people of Ebonyi state as expressed in their votes for the PDP in the 2019 governorship election.\n\n\u201cOur Party also congratulates the people of Ebonyi State for the restoration of their mandate and urged them to remain united under the PDP as we forge ahead in our mission to Rescue and Rebuild our country from the rudderless APC administration,\u201d it added.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Avuru, Co-Founder Seplat Energy, Calls for State of Emergency in Oil Sector, Says 80% of Crude Stolen",
          "text": "A Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru has called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, revealing that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen.\n\nAvuru\u2019s comments came few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal. Elumelu has his oil assets in the Niger Delta.\n\nElumelu also chairs the Board of the United Bank for Africa (UBA), holds a controlling interest in Transnational Corporation (Transcorp) and runs Trans-Niger Oil & Gas Limited (TNOG).\n\nThe owner of TNOG, which recently bought 45 per cent of Oil Mining Licence (OML) 17, argued that oil theft was generally responsible for Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota.\n\n\u201cHow can we be losing over 95 per cent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000bpd barrels of crude oil daily, instead it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator, Shell to declare force majeure,\u201d he had lamented.\n\nBut writing for Africa Oil & Gas Report, Avuru, who is the Founder/ Executive Chairman, AA Holdings and Vice Chairman Platform Petroleum, maintained that as far as 1990, Nigeria\u2019s average daily oil production was about 1.85 million barrels per day when the country\u2019s oil reserves at the time stood at about 16 billion barrels.\n\nHowever, he deplored the current situation in which Nigeria cannot meet the quota allocated by OPEC and had been struggling to produce 1.4 million barrels per day. He argued that aside theft of Nigeria\u2019s oil, with eyes fixed on divestments and exit, the International Oil Companies (IOCs) have not made any meaningful investments in the sector in the last 15 years, with the result being the current declining production.\n\n\u201cMuch worse, the entire export pipeline network has been surrendered to vandals and illegal \u2018bunkerers\u2019. Thus, the phrase \u2018crude theft\u2019 which crept into the industry about 2010 has taken on a new meaning.\n\n\u201cThere are some pipeline systems now (particularly in the East) where 80 per cent of production injected therein does not make it to the terminal! Almost every producer is now cooking up alternative evacuation schemes that cost four to five times what pipeline export would normally cost,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAvuru noted that while the decision to leave by the IOCs was outside Nigeria\u2019s control, the country\u2019s delay in passing the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) ensured that investment in the sector dried up a long time ago.\n\n\u201cIn fact, my projection is that, by Christmas day of 2025, Total would be the only IOC in Joint Venture (JV) with the NNPC,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out that the situation was not different with domestic gas delivery, adding that even though Nigeria continues to weave all the right slogans about the future of gas in Nigeria, in the past five years, he could only point at a couple of Nigerian independents who are investing in gas development and processing for the domestic market.\n\n\u201cThe state of the Nigerian petroleum industry is a national emergency. Oil production is down to about 1.4 million barrels per day and declining and this includes about 600,000BOPD from the deep water.\n\n\u201cDomestic gas production has stagnated at about 1.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day over the past five years at a time when projected production should have been 3.5Bcf per day. The collateral impact of course, is the low level of power generation which itself has stagnated at about 4,000 megawatts per day since 2015,\u201d the businessman said.\n\nOn recommendations, Avuru stressed that between the upstream regulator (the commission) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), they need to set up a, \u201cwar room\u201d, or some form of an effective task force to develop a blueprint for returning the industry to full bloom.\n\n\u201cThe responses we hear today to the myriad of problems outlined above have been ad-hoc, knee jerk and in some cases only self-serving. I dare repeat that the situation has to be treated as a national emergency,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe argued that a well-organised transition driven policy direction, from the retreating IOCs\u2019 needs to be developed, noting that intervening by pre-emptive acquisitions cannot be a sustainable solution proffered by the NNPC.\u201cThere has to be a deliberate policy-driven return to the traditional onshore/shallow water terrains. Eighty per cent of our remaining reserves are still in this belt.\n\n\u201cTo do this, we have to address the twin problems of reliable pipeline evacuation and community restiveness. These problems have become heightened, not because there is no solution, but because we have abandoned every attention to them in the last 15 years.\n\n\u201cWhen these two problems are tackled, plus a strict application of the \u2018drill or drop\u2019 provisions of the new PIA, huge investments in drilling and facilities revamp will flow again into this terrain.\n\n\u201cFinally, we have to match our gas slogans with effective, measurable, policy actions to drive investments in domestic gas supply. The current flip-flops on pricing and commercial structure of the gas business cannot stimulate investments in the sector.\n\n\u201cThis industry will not wake up by God\u2019s miracle. We have to wake up and design the stimulant that will revitalise it,\u201d Avuru said.\n\nSylva: Nigeria Will Not Support Single Track Energy Transition Strategy\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, said yesterday that Nigeria was not in support of any narrative that supports a single lane energy transition strategy.\n\nThe minister insisted that Nigeria would remain at the vanguard of the crusade for a multifaceted energy transition timetable that will attract more investments for Africa, while taking cognisance of the current global drive towards renewables.\n\nA statement by the Senior Adviser (Media & Communications) to the minister, Horatius Egua, quoted Sylva as having made the declaration on the heels of a collective decision by African petroleum and energy ministers to present a common voice at COP 27, in Egypt.\n\nThe minister insisted that Africa should be allowed to continue to exploit its hydrocarbon deposits for the development of the continent, rather than being stampeded into a process which does not fully benefit its people.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to drive the direction of the narrative for the African energy transition programme. We have stood out to say \u2018no\u2019 to a single track energy transition programme.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to support a transition agenda that will promote gas and renewed investments in the hydrocarbons sector for Africa,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nAccording to the statement, Sylva, and the Egyptian Energy Minister, Terek el Molla had been the main voices in articulating a multi-track approach to the energy transition programme for Africa.\n\n\u201cBoth leaders are of the view that for the energy transition programme to be meaningful, Africa must be factored into the global energy transition programme in such a way that takes care of the peculiar African situation.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to advocate for gas as a transition fuel for Africa. We have said that we cannot move at the same pace with the rest of the world because we contribute less than two per cent of the global greenhouse gas emission. We are not the problem and we cannot be made to pay for the sins we did not commit,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe minister added that for anyone to say Africa should abandon its abundant hydrocarbon deposits for the uncertainties of renewable energy was most unfair.\n\nHe noted that as at today, there are still people without clean cooking fuels in Africa, explaining that over 600 million people are without basic energy.\n\n\u201cSo, how do we meet their energy base load? We can only achieve this through gas. It\u2019s only through a multi-pronged approach that we can achieve this. It is obvious that we cannot move at the same pace with the rest of the world as far as the energy transition programme is concerned,\u201d he maintained.\n\nAt the just concluded CERAweek, in Houston, United States of America, the statement noted that Sylva and el Molla led other African ministers to meetings where they resolved to project a common front in the energy transition timetable for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge hydrocarbon deposits in the continent and must we abandon it because some people have said we should? Some African countries like Ghana, Angola and others are just coming to the table and should they just abandon what they have because some countries are saying we should develop renewable energy? That will be an unfair decision.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying we won\u2019t be part of the transition train for renewable energy but what we are saying as Africans is that we should be allowed to develop our natural resources and enjoy the God-given resources.\n\n\u201cI am happy that the world is beginning to listen to Africa and we are happy about that and we intend to build on that momentum at COP 27 in Egypt by coming out with a common position,\u201d he noted.",
