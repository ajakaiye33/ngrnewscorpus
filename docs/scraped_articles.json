          "text": "The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to take immediate steps to avert an imminent shutdown of flight operations in Nigeria, warning that it will have grave consequences on the country\u2019s national life.\n\nThe caucus was reacting to the strike notice issued to the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; and the Director-General, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Musa Nuhu, by the Airline Operators of Nigeria.\n\nThe AON had threatened to shut down flight operations in the country from Monday, May 9, 2022, due to the unbearable high cost of aviation fuel (Jet-A1), which had risen from N190 to N700 per litre.\n\nThe notice by the AON had indicated that the intervention by the Senate and the House in the crisis occasioned by Jet-A1 scarcity and price hike had failed.\n\nAlready, the House will on Monday hold an emergency session, less than one week after it adjourned plenary till May 24, 2022, to discuss \u201ccritical issues of national importance.\u201d\n\nThe Clerk to the House, Dr Yahaya Danzaria, announced the recall of members to the emergency session via notice issued on Saturday.\n\nMinority Leader of the House, Ndudi Elumelu, in a statement issued on Saturday and titled \u2018Minority Reps Tasks President Buhari to Avert Shutdown of Airline Operations,\u2019 blamed the crisis in the aviation sector on the government of the All Progressives Congress and the regime led by Buhari.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cThis worrisome development in Nigeria, a major producer of oil, is another very sad commentary on the unpardonable failure, corruption, incompetence, negative policies and lack of capacity of the APC-led administration to effectively manage our national economy.\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the people, the Minority Caucus is concerned because aviation is pivotal to the operation, sustenance and survival of other key sectors of the economy and any shutdown of flight operations will have devastating spiral effects and worsen the excruciating economic hardship and further escalate insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is because apart from the direct disabling of thousands of aviation related jobs and ancillary businesses, a shutdown of the sector will also have grave negative impact on critical government and public sector activities which are sustained by air travelling.\u201d\n\nThe caucus added, \u201cIt is instructive to note that the aviation sector is no longer an exclusive reserve of the elite, but plays central role in the movement of personnel and equipment that drive and sustain services and operations which benefit the masses in healthcare, manufacturing, education, food production, telecommunication, retailing, banking and finance, hospitality, entertainment, power, security and other key sectors.\n\n\u201cA shutdown of the aviation sector will therefore cripple millions of businesses as well as economic and commercial activities thereby increasing unemployment, worsen the economic hardship, put pressure on our already ailing roads and exacerbate insecurity in our country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the situation is a huge threat to our national integrity as it erodes the confidence of the International Community and foreign investors in our country thereby encouraging the movement of investments to neigbouring countries.\u201d\n\nThe opposition lawmakers, therefore, called on the President to \u201cwake up, note the grave import of the situation and save the aviation sector from imminent collapse by immediately addressing the fuel crisis and other challenges in the industry.\u201d\n\nThe caucus also asked Buhar to critically address the crisis in the petroleum industry by \u201creviewing the counter-productive policies and curbing the corruption in his administration so as to save our national economy from collapse under his watch.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Can you imagine, a political appointee bought a nomination form for N100million? Where did he get the money to do that? This is the Minister for State for Education.

          "title": "2023: Familiar faces square off in contest for Abia Senate seats",
          "text": "By \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor and Sunny Nwankwo\n\nAbia State, at the return of democracy in Nigeria in 1999, was divided into three Senatorial Districts namely; Abia North, comprising Arochukwu, Ohafia, Bende, Isuikwuato and Umunneochi local government areas, Abia Central, comprising Umuahia North and South, Ikwuano, Osisioma, Isiala Ngwa North and South LGAs and Abia South, comprising of Obingwa, Ugwunagbo, Ukwa East and Ukwa West respectively to ensure even distribution of democratic dividend across the 17 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe likes of Senators Ike Nwachukwu, Uche Chukwumerije from Abia North, Bob Nwanunu, Chris Adighije, Nkechi Nwaogu (First Abia Female Senator and National Assembly member) from Abia Central, and Adolphus Wabara and Enyinnaya Abaribe had had their shots in the senate between 1999 to 2015 representing the three senatorial districts at one time or the other.\n\nBetween 2015 till date, Senators Mao Ohuabunwa (2015-2019) Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu (2019 till date), Theodore Orji (2015-2023) and Enyinnaya Abaribe (2007-2023) have been the Senators representing the districts and speaking for the people. While some of them are seeking a return to the senate in 2023, others are eyeing other positions.\n\nAs the 2023 general elections get nearer, political parties, including the three major political parties in the state; Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, All Progressives Congress APC and All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, after their party primaries which come up later this year, will be presenting candidates to fly the flags of their parties in the three senatorial districts of the state.\n\nThe race for the Abia North senate seat got more interesting recently when Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, announced his withdrawal from the presidential race. Kalu said it was practically impossible for a President of Southeast extraction to emerge in Nigeria, except the North willingly precluded itself from the race.\n\nHe recalled that the South West was able to produce two presidential candidates in the PDP and defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) because there was an understanding to concede the Presidency to the region in 1999. Senator Kalu described as \u201cunjustifiable\u201d and \u201cinordinate,\u201d the presidential aspirants of certain chieftains of the APC and the PDP, outside the Southeast geo-political zone. With that, Kalu is believed to be concentrating on a return to the senate in 2023. Some of the aspirants running for Senate in the state across party lines include;\n\nOrji Kalu (APC)\n\nDr. Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (APC, Abia North) is the Chief Whip of the Senate and a former governor of the state. If there is anywhere in the state that APC has almost conquered, it is Abia North with three federal lawmakers; Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, Deputy Chief Whip House of Representatives, and Hon. Benjamin Kalu, spokesman of the House of Representatives.\n\nKalu, a former member of the federal House of Representatives in the 90\u2019s, is adjudged to have performed creditably well more than his predecessors. He has reportedly turned Abia North into a construction site. The level of love from his people and admirers has made Kalu a big force to win. For political opinion moulders, Kalu\u2019s going back to the Senate is non-negotiable as his people yearn for more developmental strides in their local.\n\nThey believe that Kalu\u2019s going back to Senate would bring about more democratic dividend in the area. The leadership crisis in his party is however seen as a huge distraction ahead of the elections in the state if not addressed promptly. The Senator, who has not pitched his tent with any of the warring groups, is seen as the best man who can resolve the crisis.\n\nMao Ohuabunwa (PDP Abia North)\n\nOhuabunwa as a sitting lawmaker lost his seat to Orji Kalu in 2019 after what his people tagged as \u201cabysmal\u201d performance within the four years of his representation of the people. Pundits recall that what nailed Ohuabunwa was the allegations that he empowered some of his constituents with frying pan and wheelbarrow. This generated bad blood for the then Senator, among Abia North indigenes who later showed him the exit door at the 2019 polls.\n\nOhuabunwa, who has picked nomination and expression of interest form for the senatorial seat, said he is still counting on the continued support of the people. Claiming that his mandate was stolen in 2019, Ohuabunwa assured that with the signing of the New Electoral Act into law the era of manipulation of election results was over. He assured that his mandate would never be stolen again.\n\nUko Nkole (PDP, Abia North)\n\nHon. Nkole is the member representing Arochukwu/Ohafia federal constituency. Nkole joined the Abia North Senatorial race after serving out his term in the House of Representatives. While he was able to make some impact on the lives of his people, Nkole is believed not to be the favoured candidate of the PDP for the Abia Senatorial District.\n\nUndeterred by insinuations that he is not favoured by the powers that be in his party, the federal legislator has picked his expression of interest and nomination forms to contest for the seat of Abia North District in the 2023 general election.\n\nNkole picked the form last month at the National Headquarters of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, in Abuja. He is one of the earliest politicians from the state to obtain the forms, leaving nobody in doubt of his determination to go all the way in the race.\n\nSources close to him claimed that Nkole has vowed to defeat Ohuabunwa and others at the PDP primary and go ahead to unseat former Abia state governor and Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Kalu, who is the current senator representing Abia North senatorial district.\n\nNkechi Nwaogu (APC, Abia Central)\n\nNkechi Nwaogu is the immediate past pro-chancellor of the University of Calabar (Unical) and the first Abia female Senator and National Assembly member. She represented Abia Central Senatorial District between 2007-2015. Speaking with the All Progressives Congress (APC) members in Umuahia, the state capital on Thursday as she declared her intention to return to the senate in 2023. Sen. Nwaogu promised to re-introduce the gender equality bill rejected by the national assembly.\n\nThe former pro-chancellor of Unical urged people to put into consideration that 90 percent of the current National Assembly leaders are all old timers in the legislature and said it was the older the better in terms of legislative know how.\n\nShe said as a ranking Senator who has navigated through the rudiments of the parliament, she stood a better chance than anyone else to attract the much desired democracy dividends to Abia Central.\n\nAhamdi Nweke (APGA, Abia Central)\n\nAhamdi Nweke is an Isiala Ngwa born politician and is rumoured to be contesting on the platform of APGA. Nweke has contested for the same seat in 2015 and 2019 when he lost to Senator Theodore Orji. He says he has all it takes to unseat the former governor. In January, the APGA chieftain reportedly escaped death by the whiskers when he did not fail to the bullets of assassins.\n\nAccording to reports, Nweke was lucky to have escaped without sustaining any gun injury. However, his driver was not that lucky as he sustained serious gunshot injuries. The politician was reported to have been attacked in front of his country home in Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area of the state by gunmen who had laid siege in front of his home without his knowledge.\n\nOkezie Ikpeazu (PDP, Abia South)\n\nDr. Okezie Ikpeazu is the incumbent governor of Abia State who will be serving out his 8 year tenure by 2023. He has not openly stated his intention to run for the Abia South Senatorial District, but his associates have been covertly and overtly campaigning for him. However, the rumour mill has it that he (Ikpeazu) will be replacing Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe who is running for the state governorship race in the senate.\n\nWhile others fear that coming from the same zone with Abaribe would pose a big setback for him, others opined that Ikpeazu will use his power of incumbency to sail through. Few months back, a PDP chieftain, Don Ubani, has alleged plot by the Governor Ikpeazu to hand over power to a non-old Aba successor in exchange for a seat at the Senate in 2023.\n\nUbani accused the governor of colluding with some highly-placed chieftains and leaders of the PDP in the state to jettison the \u2018Abia charter of equity\u2019 and marginalise the old Aba division in exchange for the party\u2019s Senatorial ticket. Of course, the governor\u2019s camp has denied the allegations severally. But many are eagerly waiting to see if Ikpeazu will gun for the senate seat.",

          "title": "2023: Newcomers battle old hands for senate seats in Cross River",
          "text": "By \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor and Nsa Gill, Calabar\n\nThe race for different elective positions in the 2023 general election in Nigeria is now in full swing. Cross River State is not an exception. However, our correspondent in Calabar takes a look at the senatorial races in the state and the likely persons that will occupy the three seats in 2023.\n\nThe three senatorial seats for Cross River State at the National Assembly is currently occupied by members of the People Democratic Party (PDP) even though the State is governed by an All Progressive Congress (APC) governor who decamped from the PDP to the APC barely a year ago.\n\nLast year, precisely in the mo nth of May, after almost four years of speculations, foot dragging and denials, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State finally dumped the PDP and joined the APC. He formally declared for his new party at the State Executive Council Chamber after a two-hour meeting with seven APC governors led by the then interim chairman of the party and governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nBefore then, Ayade and his media team had vilified newsmen for on many occasions reporting that the embattled governor was on his way out of the PDP. The reports were because his body languages after he lost control of the PDP structure to the National Assembly members and stakeholders in the state, following a general loss of favour in the PDP at the national level, kept pointing to his defection to the APC.\n\nWhen the PDP reconciliation committee led by former Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki visited him two months before his eventual defection, Ayade expressed his anger with the party and said he was sitting on the fence. Weeks earlier, as the plots for his decamping thickened, all the 18 local government chairmen, vice-chairmen, 196 councilors, and more than 6,000 appointees, at the Millennium square, staged a solidarity rally for Ayade, saying they were ready to \u201cswim or sink with him\u201d.\n\nBut when he defected, National Assembly members in the state, led by the three senators, disowned him and refused to follow him to the APC. Senator Gershom Bassey (PDP Cross River South), immediately told the world that the governor\u2019s defection will have little or no effect on support of Cross\u2013River People to PDP. As it turned out, majority of the National Assembly members and numerous other leading political players in the state did not to follow Ayade to the APC but pitched their tent with PDP. They berated the governor for ditching the party that made him what he is today politically, from Senator to Governor.\n\nThe development set the stage for the 2023 political war between the ruling APC and the opposition PDP in a state that hitherto had been a stronghold of the PDP since 1999. While Ayade is battling to show the world that the people of the state are with him in his decision to switch parties, the National Assembly members and other PDP leaders are eager to expose the governor\u2019s error in dumping the PDP.\n\nMany openings\n\nThe current Senators representing the three senatorial districts of the state, by ranking, include, Senator Gershom Bassey who is the caucus leader of the State in the National Assembly who has served in the Senate for two terms. He is currently vying for the position of governor of the state, leaving the Senate seat of his southern senatorial district up for a likely new face.\n\nBarely 24hours after the PDP opened the doors for sale of nomination forms to aspirants for all positions, Senator Bassey got his Expression of Interest and Nomination forms of the party from the National Secretariat in Abuja.\n\nReports say the nomination and expression of interest forms were picked for him by coalition of support groups and supporters from donations on his 60th birthday. His supporters say his coming into power will change the narrative of Cross River State and restore the lost glory of the state.\n\nIn the Central Senatorial District, Senator Sandy Onor, a first term senator and highly cerebral academician turned politician is also going for the governorship race in Cross River State instead of seeking a second term. That has also opened the central senatorial seat of the state for someone else to occupy in 2023.\n\nLast December, Senator Onor declared his interest in contesting for governor of Cross River State, 2023. The senator made the declaration at the state Peoples Democratic Power (PDP), Secretariat Complex, Calabar. There are talks that Senators Bassey and Onor may have agreed on sharing the governorship and deputy governorship slots of the PDP between them.\n\nBut Senator Jerigbe Agom Jerigbe, who is barely a year in the Senate having been elected through a by-election, is seeking re-election to the Senate. A court judgment ousted Senator Steven Odey who was earlier declared winner of the December 5, 2020 by-election. Obey had served for about eight months before the Appeal court judgement handed the victory to Senator Jerigbe.\n\nJerigbe was a two term member of the Federal House of Representatives before his elevation. He is the only senator among the serving ones that is contesting the 2023 election to retain his seat. He may get the PDP ticket unopposed because of his towering popularity but he has the last huddles to cross at the general election with contenders from other political parties, particularly the now governing APC in the State.\n\nNorthern senatorial district\n\nThis is a district where the incumbent senator (Jerigbe ) is seeking a return for another term. He is of the PDP and is likely to get his party ticket. His opponents from other political parties are not yet known but there are speculations that the APC may eventually field the state governor Prof. Ben Ayade who will have a proxy that will easily surrender the party ticket to him if he fails in his bid to get the presidential ticket of the APC.\n\nReliable party sources told The Nation that the governor already made his intention to return to the senate where he was before he became governor, in 2023. \u201cHe is in the presidential race but he is not letting his eye off the senate ticket of his district. Most party leaders are of the opinion that the governor should enjoy the right of first refusal as regards the Northern senatorial ticket.\n\nSome analysts believe that Ayade had positioned Odey for the seat in 2019 in anticipation of the 2023 race. \u201cThe plan was that it would be easier to convince Odey to vacate the seat for Ayade. But with the court throwing him out and giving Jarigbe the seat, it is now going to be a contest of fierce rivals if the governor joins the race,\u201d our source said.\n\n\u201cThe governor is also in good stead for the senatorial ticket of the APC in his zone. Although there are a couple of contenders, they all understand the fact that Governor Ayade is favoured to take the seat if he decides to run. Currently, he is running for the presidency but it is still very possible for him to enter the senate race,\u201d a source claimed.\n\nWhen and if that happens, political pundits believe that Senator Jerigbe will have a strong contest to face. Should Ayade enter the race, the contest will largely be a test of popularity for the two politicians who had been at loggerheads since the run up to the 2019 general election in the state. But if the governor fails to contest, Jarigbe is tipped by pundits as the only serving senator that may return to his seat in 2023.\n\nCentral senatorial district\n\nThere are a number of new entrants here from the two frontline parties; the APC and the PDP. In the APC, former presidential aide, Chief Okoi Obono Obla, is seeking the party\u2019s senatorial ticket. He is a foundation member of the party and knows the big and the mighty in the party while keeping base with the mass of party members and the electorate in his constituency.\n\nLast month, he urged the APC not to close its doors to genuine aspirants who have not taken public funds or have been sponsored by wealthy people. \u201cGenuine Aspirants who have not helped themselves to public funds or been sponsored by wealthy people cannot afford to buy nomination forms with such exorbitant and astronomical amounts,\u201d Obono-Obla said in a statement. It is not clear whether he has obtained the nomination forms of his party as at press time.\n\nAnother contender for the APC Central Senatorial district ticket is the current Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Eteng Jonas-Williams, who was elected as the Speaker of the 9th Assembly in 2019. Since his emergence, he has displayed total loyalty to the governor, Senator Ayade. He led members of the Assembly to endorse the governor\u2019s defection to the PDP last year. Observers of the politics of the state are suggesting that the governor may have decided to reward him with the senate ticket of the party.\n\nBut that alone may not be enough because there is another heavy weight in the race who is currently the Chairman of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Chief Akin Ricketts. Speaking at stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum held at Yakurr, Abi, Ikom and Boki while declaring his intention to contest for the senatorial seat, Ricketts promised to perform to their surprise as he has the capacity to represent the district in the National Assembly.\n\nThe former commissioner for information in the state, said: \u201cI am not coming as a usual politician but from the private sector and that he has a record of delivering on his promises. I would help in reducing the level of poverty and joblessness which are rife in the senatorial district when he emerges as senator by engaging the youths in various training and building of functional skills acquisition centres across the zone.\u201d\n\nThese three contenders are favored by arguments of zoning in the area because it is believed that of the two blocks that made of the senatorial district, that is Old Ikom bloc and the Old Obubra bloc, it is the old Obubra bloc made up of Obubra local government area and Yakurr local government area that should take the chance in 2023 elections.\n\nContenders under the PDP in the Central district are Godwin Etta, Hon. Bassey Eko Ewa and Wilfred Usani. They all are from the Old Obubra bloc. It is not certain who the party ticket may swing to but Godwin Etta, who had served as state secretary of party among other government cabinet positions, may get it over Hon. Bassey Ewa, who was former Speaker of the state assembly, before serving in the House of Representatives for two terms.\n\nSouthern senatorial district\n\nIn the Southern district, the two frontline parties seem to be looking at giving the chance to Akamkpa /Biase Federal Constituency of the senatorial district but that has not stopped other aspirants outside the Akamkpa/Biase axis who have strong pedigree from venturing.\n\nFor instance, in the APC, the current Deputy Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Joseph Bassey from outside the Akamkpa/Biase axis, is flaunting his pedigree as seasoned legislator who has grown from local government legislative council where he was leader to his experience in the state executive as the Special Adviser to former governor Liyel Imoke and a two term deputy speaker of state assembly. He is a grassroots politician and his admired by the electorate.\n\nAnother contender for the APC southern senatorial district ticket is the current Commissioner for Agriculture, Ntufam Okon Owuna, from Akamkpa local government area. There\u2019s also Chief Emil Inyang from Biase local government area. The flag bearer will be known after the primaries and the next battle will be the general election. Whatever the case, a new face will likely take the seat in 2023.\n\nFor the PDP in the Southern senatorial district race, the former state party chairman, Ntufam Ekpo Okon is slugging it out with Joseph Edet. Ntufam Ekpo Okon has a towering political pedigree but none should be under estimated in politics. Sources fear group interests can throw up the lighter weight contender over the presumed heavy weight in the ensuing political race.\n\nOkon, who was the deputy governorship candidate of the APC in the 2019 election in Cross River State, returned to the PDPlast December. He was PDP\u2019s Chairman and a Commissioner during the tenure of Donald Duke, former governor of the State, cited bad governance and lack of inclusion by Sen. Ben Ayade\u2019s administration as a reason for his cross carpeting.\n\nJoseph Esoh Edet also known by his brand name as \u201cLa\u2019shakara\u201d is a philanthropist, serial entrepreneur and politician. He appointed Senior Special Assistant to His Excellency, Governor Ben Ayade on Job placement and Entrepreneurship and this became his political launching pad. He later became the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Obudu Cattle Ranch.\n\nHe was soon elevated as the Managing Director of SummitHills Estates. During the COVID 19 pandemic, Joseph Edet was called on to head Garment Factory in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic as acting Managing Director.",

          "title": "See Warri and cry: Tale of Oil City\u2019s fall from grace to grass",
          "text": "SOUTH SOUTH REGIONAL MANAGER, SHOLA NATH O\u2019NEIL lays bare the paradox of the once flourishing city of Warri, invoking its glory days and juxtaposing it with its current decays. He tells the story of how successive governments, policies (or lack of it), the costly, protracted ethnic bloodletting and destruction has humbled a city that at its peak was touted the Dubai of Southern Nigeria.\n\nWarri invokes worries, tears for residents, visitors\n\nHow Ibori, Uduaghan and Okowa \u2018killed\u2019 the city\n\nWarri, arguably the economic nerve centre of Delta State, always fazes first time visitors. Dubbed the Oil City, it is the economic hub of the state, and a once flourishing nexus of oil and gas commerce in Nigeria. In its yore days, it was rivaled in prominence in the south-south only by Port Harcourt. It was an investors\u2019 haven. But even in its glory days, the city promised so much for first-time visitors, but delivers agonizingly very little. The refrain is usually: \u201cis this all there is to Warri?\u201d\n\nIf Warri was a failure in the past, its current wretched state is depressing for Old Warri (men and women born and/brought up in the city). This bustling town that hosted oil multinationals such as Shell Petroleum Development Company, SPDC, Chevron, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, and its subsidiaries, and other ancillaries and servicing companies, now lays supine.\n\nReflecting on the underdevelopment of the city, MC Mecoyo, a skit maker and comedian from southeastern Nigeria commented this on his recent visit to the city: \u201cI saw Warri and I was worried!.\u201d He recalled that in the past when people trooped to Warri because of its fame and companies, concluding, \u201cAs I am talking to you now, Warri is worrisome\u201d. Mecoyo is a comedian, but the current state of Warri is not a joke.\n\nFor Mike Tom, a middle-aged man, who was born in Warri and has live there for most part of his life, \u201cthe fall of Warri is painful; Warri is finished and in shambles.\u201d He described Warri as a city that has been crippled and in its final lapse of collapse\u201d.\n\nWith pain in his voice, Tom, who fits the bill of the famed \u2018Old Warri\u2019, recalled growing up in the 1970s to 80s with Snaprogetti, Santafe, the Schlumbergers, West Minster Dredging, AGIP, SSNL, and GloryLux, which provided jobs for women to support their families, concluding that Warri\u2019s fate agonises his inhabitants.\n\nThose who knew the city well could not disagree with Tom. Apart from the above, Schlumberger companies (Dowell, Anadrill), Halliburton, Pan Ocean, Oceaneering, Edikan, Nestoil, LAMNALCO, WEAFRI, ELF, and others, even small businesses thrived and the common man enjoyed chunky crumps of this success. Although there wasn\u2019t much in infrastructure to go with its fame, Mcdermott (later Globestar), Nigeria Dredging and Marine, and Seismograph Service Limited (SSL), and several others ensured that those who had little to no formal education were gainfully employed.\n\nSCOA, Mandillas, John Holt and several other motor and leisure companies jostled for space, contracts and bite of the apple. The Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) hosted dozens of maritime and shipping firms; ships berthed with cargoes and provided menial and daily job opportunities for locals. Merchant mariners and stevedoring thrived; everybody had something and even market women benefited from the thriving middleclass in the city. Warri was peaceful and enjoyable.\n\nThen the Warri Crisis erupted in 1997 and everything changed. Militias fighting site of a local government headquarters went on a five year rampage that unhinged the city. Dichotomies surfaced, tribal distinctions were highlighted and underlined as Ijaws and Itsekiri ethnic nationalities on one hand, the Itsekiris and Urhobos (mostly of Okere descendants) on the other, as well as the Ijaw/Urhobo of Ogbe-Ijaw/Aladja, battled for supremacy and land ownership. The wars exerted huge tolls and peace was its first victim, and it remains elusive. In Aladja and Ogbe-Ijoh-Warri, Urhobo and Ijaw communities in Udu and Warri South respectively, several commissions of enquiries, white papers, and peace accords have failed to sate the thirsts for blood.\n\nThe city paid heavily \u2013 and is still paying \u2013 for those crises; many lost their lives, others lost loved ones and breadwinners; children were orphaned and parents, including a pastor at the Foursquare Gospel Church, Koko, Warri North, who lost four children (thrown into the raging fire that used to be their home), and others have emblems of destructions etched in their hearts.\n\nAny government aiming to teach its citizen the effects of war and inter-tribal crises needs look no further than the once pulsating business hub of Warri \u2013 a bustling city that went from the acme of its success to its abject nadir in a couple of years. The fall was as steep as its effect was caustic.\n\nAs this reporter drove through the city in April 2022, one could feel the ebbing pulse of this dying city. It still wears the garbs of its lost glory shamelessly; its precipitous fame and lost opportunities are unabashed. The roads are deplorable, and everything about it is bleak. The current administration failed even a new road in seven years and the ones built by past government are in ruins. The unending flood control drain achieves little, apart from making commute painful and slow. From Airport road to Okere-Ugborikoko, Okere, Jakpa, Refinery and dozens others, like the city, lay in ruins. The few shining spots are results beautification projects by a Christian organization in the city.\n\nThe crests of fratricidal tribal wars survives in burnt buildings, hearts and psyches of men and women who remember what the city used to be like when there were no ethnic fault lines; when the Ijaws, Itsekiris and Urhobos intermarried and lived as a unit, and were happy to be called Waffarians. Now suspicions becloud the land where ethnic groups\u2019 social intercourse, intermarriages, shared history, values and tradition, once blurred differences.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when people are not identified as Ijaw, Itsekiri or Urhobo, they were merely Warri and Waffarians, but today the war has taken away our unity and development,\u201d Lucky Isah rued.\n\nHe recalled that in those good old days Ijaw, Itsekiri and Urhobos celebrated boat regattas on the Warri River; the yearly Agbassa, Okere and 30-yearly Awankere festivals, which drew tourists from within and outside the state. \u201cIn the 90s to late 1990s, oil-stained coveralls, helmets and life vests were indications of successful youths. Some earned up to $4,000 monthly as unskilled or semi-skilled workers, fitters, welders and dockworkers.\n\nWARRI NOW NUCLEUS OF RITUAL KILLERS, YAHOO BOYS\n\nThe city has turned on its head. The signs of successful youths in the city are Mercedes Benz GLKs, Lexus RXs and Toyota Camry (Spider) that are driven by school dropouts and teenagers, who brandish university ID cards but can barely read the inscriptions therein. They are aged from 20 \u2013 30, and didn\u2019t make their money as welders or roughnecks working in offshore rigs as their counterparts of decades past; these are heartless and ruthless youths who kill, engage in obnoxious money-rituals, and trade in human parts. They are slayers of their parents and siblings for money-minting rituals, and those who engage in armed robberies, kidnapping and other dirty deals that bring money \u2013 no matter how bestial.\n\nFamously called \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, they\u2019ve replaced the oil and servicing firms. Instead of vibrant young men and women who inspired others to learn skills such as welding and fitting, scaffolding and other high-demand oil and gas-related skills, these are criminals. They inspire younger ones of similar ilk, who dream of success without work; those than want to hammer (make money) without labour.\n\nLadies are not left out. The ambition of those who can\u2019t engage in these crimes is to marry one. Young girls whose life ambition is to own boutiques where hair extensions and wigs (human hair), clothes with fake designers\u2019 labels are sold at outlandish prices; eateries where badly cooked meals are given exotic tags and sold at prices that only crooks can afford.\n\n\u201cYou see and hear of how girls are murdered, their genitals and vital organs cut off, yet our ladies are not bothered. Some are even engaging in these acts while others want to be married to yahoo boys.\u201d\n\nThe economy of Warri, like other cities in Delta, is driven by crimes and frauds. All moral compasses are pointed south: Parents, who ought to teach their children morals, regale in their ill-gotten wealth \u2013 they even help to conceal the sources by claiming ownership of multimillion naira cars and houses bought with proceeds of these crimes. Pastors don\u2019t preach hard work as prerequisite for success or righteousness as the path to paradise; they aid crimes, collect offerings, tithes and offer their temples and altars for thanksgiving.\n\nIn the Oil City, businesses are oiled by activities of \u2018Yahoo boys\u2019. Only they, politicians, pastors and people with questionable sources buy properties. Landlords who once wouldn\u2019t let properties to yahoo boys have made volte-face\n\n\u201cThey come posing as businessmen, or techies, owners of shops in Robson Plaza (the city\u2019s answer to Computer Village in Lagos), or importers,\u201d one landlord whose apartments are fully occupied by Yahoo Boys in Effurun, said. \u201cWe (landlords) pretend to believe them and hope that they do not use our children and family for money rituals because of the condition of the city.\u201d\n\nIn between those are the graduates and master\u2019s degree holders who are determined to stay on the straight paths. For those, the escape route is commercial tricycle (keke) operation. The menace of the contraption and its operators has made the city one of the worst to drive around in Nigeria. Tom said Warri is the world headquarters of tricycle, even calling for it to be banned. The stress of surviving in the crowded business ages operators faster than their ages.\n\nHOW PDP GOVERNMENTS FAILED WARRI FOR 20 YEARS\n\nThe tale of Warri fall from grace is incomplete without record of the role played by successive governments that failed to develop the city since 1999. Firmly under the grip of the ruling Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP), three successive governments have failed to initiate or follow through on projects and policies that were meant to maintain the status of the city as the economic capital of Delta as well as help the state wean its dependency on crude oil.\n\nJAMES ONANEFE IBORI: remains the godfather of the state\u2019s politics, despite his sojourn and incarceration in the United Kingdom for money laundering. Many believe that Warri, and other parts of the state would continue the slide until his influence as \u2018selector\u2019 of leaders is curbed. \u201cHe created the culture of picking unqualified among the various ethnic groups and empowering them to lead. The focus is not on development but on people who could \u2018deliver\u2019 (help win elections)\u201d, an Itsekiri leader (names withheld) once told this reporter.\n\nIn fairness to him, Ibori developed his home Oghara kingdom (at the detriment of the state), ensuring that most projects were sited there. Roads were constructed and federal and state projects taken to Oghara and neighboring abodes. ECONET\u2019s (later Airtel) telecom training school, Nigeria Navy School of Logistics, and (moribund) Independent Power Plant, found Oghara as most suitable location. When he established up three polytechnics, two were sited Otefe Oghara and Mosogar (within 20 mile) in his Ethiope West LGA. Delta State University Teaching Hospital (DELSUTH) was sighted in Oghara, which is more than 31km from the school, even though a full-fledge Baptist Medical Hospital was at DELSU\u2019s doorstep in nearby Eku.\n\nDespite his shortcomings, Ibori is still revered road dualisation projects in Warri and environs. Sadly, those projects were used for \u2019empowerment\u2019 of godfathers, cronies and friends. Attention was not paid to quality, resulting in projects failing even before contracts left sites. Airport Road has been resurfaced/revamped about five times since 2007. Today, it currently lays in ruin. The World Bank assisted multibillion naira Warri Water Project, has defied solutions for 20 odd years, making Warri a thirsty city that sits atop water. Landlords and homeowners are their own \u2018water boards\u2019, electricity and security providers.\n\nEMMANUEL EWETAN UDUAGHAN (2007 -2015): He succeeded Ibori, his cousin and childhood friend, in 2007. He is a Warri boy, whose emergence raised hope that the Oil City would finally be developed. Sadly, during his tenure, oil multinationals fled the city in droves. From downsizing in the mid-2000s through SoFu (Securing our Future) initiatives, SHELL shut down its operation in Warri and moved to deep sea (circa 2013), and in 2014 crude prices crashed throwing the state into abyss. Critics blame Uduaghan for not doing enough to stop the relocation of SHELL, but the yeast that destroyed Warri started fermenting years earlier..\n\nShell relocation was just the final nail in the coffin; oil companies were fleeing Warri in the wake of the crisis, and unfriendly operating environment. The Warri Crisis sowed the wind that yielded the whirlwind that finally blew companies out of the state, and taking with them jobs, opportunities and multibillion naira monthly tax revenues. The destruction of oil facilities and cut of oil supply also hit the state\u2019s finances.\n\nUduaghan tried to stimulate economic activities in the city with lobbies to resuscitate the comatose Warri Ports and Delta Steel Company (DSC). There were economic projects and initiatives, such as Warri Economic Business Centre, the Oleri Entertainment Village and expansion and upgrade of the Warri Airport (Osubi), in tandem with his administration\u2019s Delta Without Oil vision. There were others like the Warri-Trans-Ode-Itsekiri (Big Warri) road project, Omadin, Okerenkoko \u2013 Oporoza and others to link the mainland (Warri metropolis) to the other Warri LGA\u2019s of the state.\n\nHowever, Uduaghan\u2019s administration would be remembered by stakeholders as a lost opportunity to turn Warri\u2019s fortune around. He brimmed with ideas for the city, but lacked the zeal of execution. His Itsekiri kinsmen would rue his failure to complete the Warri-Ode-Itsekiri road project. The road would have linked and opened up the Ode-Itsekiri through a bridge over the Warri River to Ubeji and other historical Itsekiri villages into the metropolis.\n\n\u201cUduaghan was in the best position to build the Ode-Itsekiri Bridge and ensure that we can drive our cars into our ancestral home, yet, he choose to be a statesman and frittered the chance,\u201d an Ubeji community leader said.\n\nThere is also his failure to turn the tide on horrendous underdevelopment and squalor in oil-rich Ugborodo community in Warri Southwest LGA. The area accounts for a huge mass of the state\u2019s oil production, and hosts the first offshore oil field in Nigeria (Okan Field), yet stench of its poverty is pervasive. Few powerful youths and leaders amass and fiddle with its resources. A multibillion naira new town project is stalled for over 20 years, while inhabitants live in squalor of makeshift huts and shanties.\n\nMillions of naira paid by Chevron Nigeria Limited for the relocation of inhabitants of the current site of the $9billion Escravos Gas to Liquid (EGTL) went into the pockets of few powerful individuals and politicians. Even sharp sand that was dredged for construction of houses was sold.\n\nIFEANYI ARTHUR OKOWA: If Uduaghan lacked political will to develop Warri, the same cannot be said of the current governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa. If anything, the Agbor-born politician has used power brazenly in execution of projects in his hometown of Owa in Ika Northeast LGA, even at the detriment of Warri and other parts of the state. He accused by some of deliberately undermining the status of Warri areas as the goose the lays the state\u2019s golden eggs.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s body language is as if his hometown can only develop when Warri is destroyed,\u201d a former member of his cabinet told our reporter. The source, who asked not to be named, revealed that the governor has throughout his administration starved the Warri-Uvwie and Environs Development Commission of fund, while massively funding the Asaba Capital Territory Development Commission and projects in Ika. The source further added that the closure of the Governor\u2019s Office Annex in Warri, was part of the governor\u2019s agenda to ensure that the city does not rival the state capital in prominence. The office annex was used as a venue for peace meetings and to address security challenges in the city and other parts of oil bearing south by the governor\u2019s two predecessors.\n\n\u201cOkowa and some stakeholders in the north do not like the idea that there is a Government House Annex in Warri. They think it is a conspiracy to create another capital city to rival Asaba. So, when Okowa (from the Delta North) came, he saw his position as an opportunity to downgrade Warri, without realizing the role that the office played in peace and security in the riverside areas,\u201d a Warri member of the PDP said, on condition of anonymity because of his political future.\n\nElder statesman and former labour leader, Chief Frank Kokori, slammed Governor Okowa as an \u201cethnic champion\u201d with \u201cself-centered policies\u201d. Speaking with The Nation\u2019s Elo Edremoda, Kokori elaborated: \u201cBefore, Warri had everything. Now, the whole roads are bad (no (good road) network, nothing. The man is trying to turn his own place to a small London, like we accused Ibori of.\u201d\n\nOur checks revealed that it is not only leaders like Kokori that are unhappy with Okowa\u2019s distribution of projects. Our finding shows that there are other disgruntled segments in the Delta North Senatorial District (made up of eight LGAs), who accuse him of siting all new projects in his Owa (Oyibo and Aliero) hometown in Ika Northeast. A source confided in our reporter that the governor has also drawn the ire of a first class traditional ruler in the north over such antics.\n\n\u201cOkowa has established three new universities, and sited a medical school in Agbor (Ika Northwest), whiles the Delta State University Teaching Hospital in Oghara, is dying from lack of fund. There is already a campus of DELSU in Anwai, yet he felt the state needs three new universities all because he wanted one in his homestead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is the Oleri Tourist village in Udu (near Warri) initiated by Uduaghan, but instead of continuing with the project, he started a new tourist/film village in Ika land with expedient financing and speedy development,\u201d another source added.\n\n\u201cThis clannish mindset is also exhibited with the state\u2019s airports. He is consciously neglecting the Warri (Osubi) Airport, but heavily financing the Asaba Airport initiated and inaugurated by his immediate predecessor in the north. If Uduaghan had been so clannish would there be an Airport in Asaba?\n\n\u201cOkowa also took the Advanced Diagnostic Medical Centre, and the Mother and Child Hospital to Owa Alero; Federal Road Safety Commission Training School, Owa-Oyibu, Teachers Professional and Development Centre, Owa-Oyibu, all centred just within short distance from his home town in Ika Northeast,\u201d the source stated.\n\nFor Kokori, the location of the medical centres in the governor\u2019s hometown is to kill DELSUTH in Oghara. \u201cOkowa is becoming something else. It\u2019s an egocentric sort of attitude. He won\u2019t be the governor forever, so he should think about that. That is why his legacy will just go back to the dustbin when he leaves that place. We are not saying Ika people should not have something, but not by neglecting sections of the state, like the whole Ukwani, Ndokwa people.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery governor of Delta state should treat the three senatorial districts equally and distribute all these infrastructures equally among them. It is unfair to the people. I am not in PDP, but I am not happy with what he is doing. He should think of the future and being patriotic to the people. Delta state needs a leader that carries the whole people because Delta is a multilingual, multiethnic state. He should put that in his mind in all the policies he makes,\u201d Kokori added.\n\nThe Chief Press Secretary to Governor Okowa, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, was unperturbed by the allegations against his boss. Rather than react to the issues raised by the governor\u2019s critics, the CPS engaged in a game of hide-and-seek with our reporter, Okungbowa Aiwerie, who was detailed to get the governor\u2019s reaction. For over one month Ifeajika kept promising to react without doing so. He made and broke similar promise twice without responding at press time on Saturday.",

          "title": "Cross-border movements within the global village",
          "text": "There are close to two hundred independent nations and territories in the world ranging in size from geographical behemoths like Russia and Canada, to little specks in the oceans like Grenada. Other countries like China and India boast of populations in excess of one billion people each and others like Andorra and Bermuda boast of populations of a few hundred thousand. In terms of the condition of people in the various countries, this varies over such a broad spectrum that it is futile to make any attempt at categorisation. Before the rise of the nation state, especially in Europe, borders hardly existed in any meaningful way and people moved freely over the globe putting down roots where they thought they could make a living. In many cases however, such movement was not voluntary, the greatest example of this being the Trans-Atlantic movement of Africans over a four hundred year period when an estimated twelve million Africans were forcibly taken from Africa and enslaved on plantations in the New World, to work from cradle to grave, creating wealth for the people of Europe. It is the wealth created by African slaves that built the foundation for the affluence now enjoyed by people of European descent in Mainland Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and people of European descent in South Africa.\n\nWith the end of slavery within the Western hemisphere beginning from 1834 in places under British control, the USA in 1865 and Brazil in 1888, there was an acute shortage of labour because the newly freed slaves exercised their new found freedom by walking away from the places of their enslavement thereby creating a big problem for people with huge plantations to run. This led to a situation in which people were transported from mainly China and India to replace the black people who had been liberated from slavery. The British turned to their possessions in India and recruited indentured servants who were expected to work for very low wages for a certain short period before coming back to their places of origin. The Americans were at that point beginning to build the railways which stitched their large country together. They would have found it impossible to do this without the large scale importation of labour from China which is why you have a visible population of ethnic Chinese in the USA today. In the period after the civil war in the States, there was a shortage of labour needed to drive the vastly expanded industrial sector of their economy and so they turned to Europe for migrants to fill the slack, which is why there are so many Americans with consonant heavy names from Eastern Europe, mainly Poland as well as Roman Catholics from Ireland and Italy. In all this time, there was a steady trickle of Jews escaping the persecution and periodic pogroms visited on them in many parts of Eastern Europe including Russia and in the time just before the Second World War, in Germany. The continuous arrival of people in the USA over the last five centuries means that that country is a nation of migrants, the indigenous people of the place having been hunted down, killed and their land expropriated from them.\n\nA new kind of migration took place in the period immediately following the end of the Second World War. With millions of people dying in the war, there was an acute shortage of unskilled labour in the formerly belligerent countries of Britain, France and Germany. The British turned to their former slave colonies in the West Indies and brought over thousands of black people to do what we should not shy away from describing as the dirty jobs which native Britons shunned and perhaps loathed with a passion. It is clear that this policy was not well thought out because nobody quite realised the consequences of bringing people over from their own countries to solve a short term problem. The West Indians had been persuaded to look at Britain as the great Mother country which needed their help and they were therefore willing to come over to do their bit. Not even they, gave any thought to what was going to happen to them within a community in which they stood out so prominently on account of the colour of their skin.\n\nOver in Germany, the same problem was being faced and the same solution was proffered. Germany and Turkey, at that time the leading part of the now defunct Ottoman Empire were allies in the First World War. They lost that war but memories of their alliance persisted and so it was almost natural that the Germans turned to their former allies to provide what they described as guest workers for their factories which were beginning to come back to life after the war. These migrations of course have had a profound effect on the demography of those countries and explains why the current English football team has a preponderance of young men of Caribbean descent and why the German football team has, over the last few years paraded players with names like Khedira, Ozil, Can and Guandogan even if some of them are now questioning the essence of their German connection. In this respect, no other country is more visible than France which has won the World cup twice in the space of twenty years with teams made up primarily of players of Arabic, African and West Indian descent with a sprinkling of ethnic Frenchmen thrown in for good measure, a veritable United Nations of footballers representing one nation. It is worthy of mention that the French parading their team of stars from all over the world are once again favourites to win the World cup for the third time when the finals of that competition take place in Qatar in a few months\u2019 time.\n\nThe USA is above everything else a nation of migrants not even because virtually all Americans can trace their origins overseas but because over the last one hundred and fifty years, more than half of the population of the country have arrived from somewhere else. In those years also, the contribution of migrants to every facet of life has been overwhelming. The USA is by far the capital of food varieties and the world is eating all kinds of foods brought to the USA by migrants and have evolved in different ways to a truly wondrous mixture of cuisines which have been exported all over the world even if there is a downside to this phenomenon. The world has taken to eating American foods even when they are nutritionally inferior to locally available foods which are being or have been forced out of the menu available in other parts of the world where they have been domesticated. There are of course other aspects where migrant vigour has pushed the USA along the path of sustained development and as long as the very high standard of living associated with this country persists, she will continue to be a lodestone, attracting people from all over the world. This inevitably means that as long as migrants continue to arrive, they will precipitate various forms of advancement which guarantees even greater development. There is therefore a strong suggestion that migrants contribute a great deal to their host communities so that on balance migrations should be encouraged as much as possible. But what we see in practice is the direct opposite of this observation. The world is not likely to forget in a hurry that the immediate past President of the US, Donald Trump was so obsessed with keeping immigrants out of his country that he talked about and did little else besides building what he called a beautiful wall to keep illegal Latin immigrants from entering the United States through their southern border with Mexico. His otherwise inexplicable popularity with the American electorate gained traction as a result of this policy of exclusion.\n\nIn the period since the end of the Second World War, the rich nations of the world have built up extensive welfare states in which a great deal of services are free at the point of delivery. In Britain for example, the National Health Service is guaranteed to provide decent healthcare services to those who need them without having to pay for them directly. This and other welfare services may be free to the recipient but it is paid for in full by everyone who has a job and pays taxes which swallow up a considerable proportion of all legitimate income. There are utilities aplenty but they are paid for on a cash and carry basis and those who default in making payment for any service are instantly cut off and denied service. You do not need a vivid imagination to think of what happens to a household which cannot pay their electricity bill in the dead of winter. In terms of shelter, most people are a salary or two away from homelessness and this means that being in one form of employment or the other is a matter of life or death. These may be the features of life in the West but the options available are way more attractive than what is available to most people in the poorer countries where, as in the case of Nigeria, no less than 70% or 140million people are, at least technically regarded as poor, many of them very poor. This means that they have no access to education, healthcare, decent shelter and food which are wanting in both quality and availability. The irony of this particular situation is that these poor people are most unlikely to scrape together the means necessary to effect their migration to friendlier climes where, at least in their fevered imagination, there is almost unlimited access to life more abundant. The people who are able to vote for a higher standard of living with their feet are those who already enjoy a standard of living far in excess of what is available to their much less fortunate compatriots. These people may be welcome in their destination because they have the skills which are required to further drive the development of their already sophisticated host communities. In other words, they are a form of development aid from the underdeveloped to vastly more developed countries.\n\nThe problem about migration begins when a large number of undeveloped people decide to gate crash into developed countries in search of greener pastures. They are looked upon as jobbers in search of free meals and are therefore ruthlessly excluded from the rich countries sometimes in the crude manner of building walls across borders. The situation is made worse when the would-be migrants profess a religion which is different from the prevailing Christianity of the Western countries. Unfortunately, right now millions of people are fleeing from the chaos in Syria and it has been made clear that they are especially not welcome in fortress Europe where strong arm tactics have been prepared to effect their exclusion from paradise as it were.\n\nThe problem of migration is global but can you imagine the chaos and confusion which will ensue if just 10% of Nigerians, 20 million souls in all, decide to hightail it out of their country which at the moment is a hot bed of existential challenges?",

          "text": "Mixed reactions have trailed the exclusion of Nigerian graduates from a new United Kingdom visa \u2013 high potential individual visa.\n\nThe United Kingdom stated that the new visa excluded Nigerian university graduates from applying for the scholarship based on the requirement that graduates applying must be from any of the universities in the top 50 global rankings.\n\nThe new visa allows holders of first degrees, Masters and doctorates to travel to the country and work in fields such as science, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship by May 30.\n\nThe visa also allows applicants to relocate to the UK without a prior job offer or sponsorship.\n\nBut some of the requirements excluded those who graduated from Nigerian universities.\n\nThe Nation learnt it costs \u00a3715 to secure the HPI visa and one does not need to secure a job in the UK or need to be sponsored by any employer.\n\nThe individual must also have about \u00a31,248 in one\u2019s account for about 28 days and capacity for English proficiency.\n\nThe UK government had said to qualify for the HPI visa, applicants needed to have been awarded a degree from an overseas university.\n\nThe university has to be one of the top global universities as published in the global universities list by the Home Office.\n\nIt explained that that the list would be compiled annually and comprise institutions included in the list of the top 50 universities in at least two of the following ranking systems: Times Higher Education World University rankings, Quacquarelli Symonds World University rankings, and the Academic Ranking of the World Universities.\n\nBut checks by The Nation show Nigerian universities do not appear in any of these global rankings.\n\nReacting, many Nigerians took to social media to express their views over this latest development which is expected to commence May 30.\n\nGregory Obiajulu Mumbor said: \u201cAll these discriminations are fueled by the chains of bad leadership that have plagued Nigeria over these years. lf Nigeria had a system that works and piloted by responsible leaders, Nigeria universities as at today will be highly. rated among the very best in the world.\u201d\n\nBen Okogun lamented: \u201cNigeria Universities are not list in the eligible schools. What a shame? What has Nigeria been doing in the last 62years? The schools are even on strike as we speak.\u201d\n\nMark Ushie stated: \u201cThe question: Is your university among the top 50 in the world? If yes, then apply; if not, then meet the 12 months criteria.\u201d\n\nAdebukola Michael said: \u201cNigeria youths with the best brains but we are cursed with bad leadership. We have the best mineral resources and human resources but no human developments.

Emefiele has not officially indicated interest in competing for the Presidential flag of the APC, saying he is focused on strengthening the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nExpressing the reason for their push for Emefiele, the farmers said the CBN governor\u2019s tenure as head of the Nigerian apex bank, \u201chas shown capacity, focus, courage and worked tirelessly with the economic team of President Mohammadu Buhari to keep the economy of our great country afloat above recession and outright collapse.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey said they took the decision having realised that the CBN governor \u201cis one of the trusted and tested Nigerians that have the commitment and competence to protect the interests of farmers across the country and give priority to commodity and agricultural value chain.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe leaders of 30 farmers\u2019 associations met in Abuja last Wednesday to articulate their position on the Nigerian presidency, saying that they are the biggest stakeholders in the country ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nOne of the conveners of the meeting, Malam Ibrahim Garba said the robust national security the country needs now could only be achieved through food security.\n\n\n\nGarba said: \u201cAgriculture is the key to achieving national security. Through agriculture, millions of Nigerians are economically empowered and gainfully engaged, our industries are revived, a multifaceted value chain ecosystem created, and food security is ensured.\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite the Covid-19 pandemic, Nigerians were never short of food. We were never hungry even when every country in the world shut its borders for nearly a year.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly God knows what would have happened if we were importing the food we eat. There would have been war. But that was averted due to the resilience of Nigerian farmers and commitment to agriculture by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.\u201d\n\n\n\nA leader from the South-east, Chief Madu Ndubuisi, said the representatives of farmers and their leaders decided to acquire an APC form for Emefiele, who is the driver of the Buhari agricultural revolution, to sustain this unprecedented agricultural feat.\n\n\n\n22 APC Presidential Aspirants Pick Forms\n\nAs at last night, no fewer than 22 presidential aspirants had purchased the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms of the APC ahead of Tuesday\u2019s deadline.\n\nThe new aspirants that picked forms are Emefiele; former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; the Senator representing Ondo-North, Ajayi Boroffice and the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu.\n\n\n\nOthers that had earlier picked forms are Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi; former Imo State governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Minister of State, Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajuiba; former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu and Uju Kennedy, the only female aspirant.\n\n\n\nThe APC has also sold forms to Pastor Tunde Bakare; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the youngest presidential aspirant, Nicholas Bello; Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; former Senate President, Ken Nnamani and Minister of Labour and Productivity, Chris Ngige.\n\n\n\nOthers are Jigawa State Governor, Abubakar Badaru; the former Governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yerima and the former speaker, House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole.\n\n\n\nYerima, Onu Join Race to Succeed Buhari\n\nYerima joined the presidential race yesterday, declaring that he had informed President Buhari of his ambition.\n\nYerima, who spoke after meeting with the President at the State House, Abuja, said he was seeking the presidential ticket of APC with the aim of improving on the efforts of the Buhari administration.\n\n\n\nOn his plans to set things straight for Nigeria, Yerima said he would be focusing on three critical areas of needs namely insecurity, poverty and ignorance.\n\n\n\nLikewise, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovations, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, yesterday officially declared his intention to vie for the APC\u2019s presidential ticket ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\n\n\n\nSouth-west presidential aspirants meet in Lagos\n\nSouth-west APC presidential aspirants and leaders met in Lagos yesterday and reached an agreement to ensure that the region produces the next APC presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nA former National Chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande, made this known while addressing journalists at the end of the meeting.\n\n\n\nHe said the South-west APC presidential aspirants, governors and other leaders are united ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\nThe party stalwarts and aspirants also agreed \u201cto talk to themselves and the public with absolute decorum.\u201d\n\nAkande said: \u201cWe are united as we will ensure that the presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will come to the South-west.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had a fruitful discussion.

          "text": "\n\n*Declares only Rivers entitled to 13% derivation from the wells\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday resolved the issue of the state entitled to the revenues from 17 oil wells in Akri and Mbede communities in favour of Rivers State.\n\n\n\nBoth Rivers and Imo states have been engaged in legal battles over the ownership of the 17 oil wells located in boundary communities between the two states.\n\n\n\nThe National Boundary Commission had in the Nigeria Administrative Map, 10th, 11th, 12th, and other maps delineated the two communities in which the 17 oil wells are located in Imo State.\n\n\n\nBut, Rivers State, citing decree No. 14 of 1967, Decree No. 12 of 1976, the White papers/conclusion of the Federal Military Government on the Irikefe and the Nasir Boundary Commission/Boundary Adjustment Commission, amongst others, claimed ownership of the disputed communities and urged the court to declare same.\n\n\n\nDelivering judgment in the suit that had the Attorney General of the Federation and Imo State as 1st and 2nd defendants respectively, the apex court held that from the evidence before it, the affected oil wells fell in the area belonging to Rivers.\n\n\n\nIn the summary judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, which was prepared by Justice Helen Ogunwunmiju, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s case succeed in part\u201d and went ahead to declare that \u201cit is only Rivers State that is entitled to receive the full allocation of the distributable revenue derived from the oil wells on the basis of the 13% derivation principle as provided for under Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended, among others.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe court based its decision on the fact that the boundary between Rivers and Imo states, as delineated in Nigeria Administrative Map 10th, 11th, 12th, editions and other maps bearing similar delineation was inaccurate, incorrect, and did not represent the legitimate and lawful boundaries between Rivers and Imo states.\n\n\n\nThe apex court had earlier declared that the correct instruments, map and documents to be relied upon in determining the boundary between Rivers and Imo states were those used by Rivers State in delineating the boundary line between the two states, including Decree No. 14 of 1967, Decree No. 12 of 1976, the White papers/conclusion of the Federal Military Government on the Irikefe and the Nasir Boundary Commission/Boundary Adjustment Commission, the Eastern Nigeria Map, the Provincial Map of Owerri Province, Warri Province, Onitsha Province, Rivers Province, the Ahoada District Map and Aboh Division Map.\n\n\n\nThe apex Court also declared that based on the correct instruments, maps and documents for determining the boundary between Rivers and Imo states, the following Rivers State communities wrongly attributed to Imo State, among other communities, are communities within the territorial boundaries of Rivers State and therefore communities in respect of which Rivers State was entitled to exercise governmental and administrative powers, including entitlement to benefits derivable from mineral or other resources within the communities.\n\n\n\nOther reliefs sought by Rivers State, which were granted by the unanimous judgment include: \u201cA declaration that all the oil wells within Akri and Mbede communities, usually identified with the names Akri and Mbede, including the oil wells identified on Rivers State Map showing the location of oil wells wrongly attributed to Imo State, including Akri 012, Akri 009, Akri 010, Akri 004, Akri West 002, Akri 001, Akri West 001, Akri 003, Akri 002, and Akri South 001, Mbede 017, Mbede 010, Mbede 019, Mbede 018, Mbede 002, Mbede 009, and Mbede 005 are all oil wells within the territory of Rivers State and form part of Rivers State and that it is only Rivers State that is entitled to receive the full allocation of the distributable revenue derived from the oil wells on the basis of the 13% derivation principle as provided for under Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, among others.\n\n\n\n\u201cA declaration that the Plaintiffs\u2019 Map No. 2020/0303 \u2014 LD of 22/12/2020 showing the boundary line between the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant represents the correct boundary between the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant.\n\n\u201cAn Order of Injunction directing the 1st Defendant to withdraw from circulation its Administrative Map 10th Edition, 11th Edition and 12th Edition and to refrain from relying on any of the said Maps for the purpose of determining the boundary between the Plaintiff and the 2nd defendant.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe apex court, however, refused to make an order of Mandatory Injunction directing the AGF \u201cto calculate, to the satisfaction of the Plaintiff, and refund to the Plaintiff all revenue that have been wrongly denied the Plaintiff and wrongly attributed to or paid to Imo State on account of the limit or extent of their territories, including earnings due to the Plaintiff from distributable, revenue derived from the Akri and Mbede oil wells.\u201d\n\nThe court also refused to order the defendant to pay the Plaintiff the sum of N500 million as costs for the prosecution of the Plaintiff\u2019s suit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined\u201d\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nNot comfortable with stereotypes and alleged blackmail anymore, a foremost umbrella body for the north, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), yesterday, reacted to the ongoing controversy and constant bashing of the region over zoning within the two leading political parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 and declared that the North would not allow itself to be blackmailed any more, neither was it afraid of the country\u2019s break-up.\n\n\n\nThe forum, in a statement in Kaduna, warned that gone were the days, when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nAccording to the statement signed by the Secretary General of the forum, Murtala Aliyu, the North is not and had never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President, maintaining however, that anything that would be done to achieve that must be in accord with the law and democratic principles.\n\nACF said some Southern politicians were already \u201cgiving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum not to elect anyone from the North as president or we will break up the country!\u201c\n\n\n\nIn the statement title, \u201cEnough of the blackmail\u201d, the ACF warned that gone were the days when Northerners felt blackmailed by certain narrative from the South, but that the times had changed.\n\n\n\nThe statement read: \u201cA long running political riddle that has continued to frustrate all efforts at achieving \u2018justice, equity and fair-play\u2019 is this: anything and everything in which the North has superiority or advantage or strength is, in the opinion of many Southerners, fake or contrived or speculative and therefore unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese Southerners contest the facts that the North has 78% of the landmass of Nigeria. They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey will never acknowledge the fact that all the beef, all the tomatoes, the onions, the beans, etc. consumed in the South, is produced in the North. They concede nothing. On the contrary, they say the North brings nothing to the table and is entitled to nothing. Not to an equitable share of national revenues, not to a fair share of employment in the public services or to admissions into public schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the law says, for example, that election outcomes must be based on one man one vote, they quickly dismiss it as an \u2018imposition\u2019 by Northerners. They contest every fact, every principle including those that formed the basis of our union such as our federation, our system of administration, our\u2077 democracy, etc.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd as we inch up towards the 2023 elections, it comes as no surprise that some Southern politicians are giving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum which roughly translates thus: elect no one from the North as President or we will break up the country!\n\n\n\nBut what are the facts?\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Fourth Democratic Republic is about 22 years old. Of this, Northerners ruled for only ten years. But in-spite of this, some southern politicians are furious, issuing dare warnings against the election of any Northerner as president. It has to be stated clearly and for the avoidance of any doubt that the North is not and has never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnything that will be done to achieve that, however, must accord with the law and democratic principles. Gone are the days when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe North does not seek to dominate any part of the country but will not submit itself to be relegated to serfdom. Those issuing ultimatums are to be pitied, knowing that they know not what they are doing. They own no patent nor monopoly of the art or science of ultimatums.

          "title": "The cat-and-mouse game over zoning",
          "text": "Where should the next president come from? In the unwritten code that guides matters of national politics in Nigeria, the answer is obvious. A northerner will have been president for eight years by 2023 and it is naturally expected that the next one will be a southerner. Ideally, where the next president comes from or where the commander-in-chief worships should not matter. Nigerians need a competent and patriotic leader who can unleash our enormous economic potential and tackle insecurity convincingly. But in realpolitik, ethnic, regional and religious sentiments are of significance in the Nigerian power game. That explains why power rotation and zoning are always on our lips.\n\nBut there is a game within the game and, to use a tired clich\u00e9, this is heating up the polity. Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), recently poured water on assumptions that the ruling party had already decided to zone its presidential slot to the south. It had been presumed that since he, a northerner, has just been chosen as the party chairman, coupled with the fact that the current president is a northerner, then presidency would go to the south. But Adamu came out to say the issue of zoning the presidential ticket had not been settled. Officially speaking, he was correct. On record, only the party\u2019s national offices were zoned.\n\nWhat is Adamu up to? His rhetoric, I believe, is influenced by the game going on in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The leading opposition party appears determined to get back power in 2023 and would be ready to adopt any strategy to achieve its aim. Some in PDP apparently believe that it would be to the party\u2019s advantage to field a northerner. With the number of votes in the north, they probably did their maths and concluded that fielding a northerner against a southerner from the APC would boost their chances at the polls. The party that wrote power rotation in its constitution has, for all intents and purposes, jettisoned the principle in order to leave the APC on the backfoot.\n\nIn a sense, those pushing for a northern candidate in the PDP have their argument. Although the party was in power for 16 years \u2014 from 1999 to 2015 \u2014 a northerner was president for only three of those years. Even at that, it was a terminally ill President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua that was in office during which he was in and out of the hospital till he died. The pro-north group can, therefore, argue that the 16 years of PDP were overwhelmingly in the hands of southerners \u2014 Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan \u2014 and northerners in the party were short-changed. They can argue that the onus to zone to the south is on APC, not PDP. That would form a good debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere do I stand? I have never hidden it: I am for power rotation. Why do I support rotation? I have my reasons, which I have been advancing in various tones and forms on this page for close to 20 years. One, in a diverse, multi-ethnic and multi-religious underdeveloped African society such as ours, there will always be fears of domination. People want to be assured that they would not be eternally disadvantaged because they do not have the numbers. Accommodation is partly assured when it is established that political power \u2014 which Nigerians perceive, rightly or wrongly, as the biggest dispenser of scarce opportunities \u2014 will not be monopolised by the biggest groups.\n\nTwo, our inability to address certain questions concerning our nationhood is causing too much distraction from the real goal of national development. We keep playing identity politics. The interests of the political elite are best served through the perennial emphasis on ethnic, religious and regional identities. Whereas the ordinary Nigerian is troubled about access to safe water, decent housing, food, healthcare, education and security, they do not set the agenda for electioneering. Instead, they are unwittingly co-opted into discussing the sentiments of the political elite who are more interested in the politics of sharing the \u201cnational cake\u201d in form of appointments and contracts.\n\nAs a result of the sheer power of the political elite to impose their agenda above that of the ordinary Nigerians, we will always place identity politics above development politics. Come and see ordinary people at newspaper stands in Abeokuta, Abakaliki and Abaji arguing over north and south and Christian and Muslim when they do not know where their next meal will come from or if they will not be kidnapped or killed on their way home. My thinking, therefore, is that until we appease the political elite by settling the issue of predictability of where power will go at election times, they will not allow us to table a development agenda, which is what really matters to 200 million Nigerians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile I support \u201cpower shift\u201d to the south in 2023, I also want to quickly raise two issues. One, where there is no law, there is no offence. The parties are free to take their tickets anywhere. If both APC and PDP pick northern candidates, no court of law can annul it. Power rotation is not a legal matter \u2014 it is a political understanding. Two, since this is an understanding, we should always leave a room for good politics in making it work. Blackmail and intimidation would be counterproductive. Playing good politics means forging the right alliances and striking the right chord, not threatening other regions and ethnic groups with war. That would only amount to work avoidance in my view.\n\nThe notion that the south-west got presidency in 1999 because of the violence unleashed by the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) cannot be true. Bashorun MKO Abiola won the June 12 election in 1993 and it was annulled. This plunged the nation into a prolonged political crisis. When Abiola died in detention in 1998, the political class came together and agreed to compensate the south-west over the annulment as well as his death. Even at that, Dr Alex Ekwueme, from the south-east, contested against Obasanjo at the PDP primary and lost by a wide margin. OPC did not stop its violent campaign for \u201cOduduwa Republic\u201d after Obasanjo became president but he contained them.\n\nNeither did Jonathan become president in 2011 because of Niger Delta militancy. The militants were not asking for presidency. They wanted 100 percent control of the oil and gas resources in their region and started a bombing campaign in 2005. At no time did they demand that the president after Obasanjo should come from the Niger Delta, except I missed it. In any case, Jonathan was not going to be running mate to Yar\u2019Adua until some last-minute abracadabra at the PDP presidential convention ground in Abuja. Jonathan became president not because of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) but because Yar\u2019Adua died unexpectedly in 2010.\n\nI heard people argue when Jonathan was in power that the north propped up Boko Haram after Buhari lost to him in 2011 in order to push for power to return to the region in 2015. This conspiracy theory stands on nothing. Buhari has now been in office for nearly seven years and Boko Haram has continued to wreak havoc on the north. This is to say nothing about the attempt on Buhari\u2019s life in Kaduna in 2014 by suspected Boko Haram members or the various attacks on mosques in Borno and Kano states by the terrorist group. How it could ever be interpreted that the Boko Haram militancy was designed to take power back to the north beats the imagination. The facts do not support this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf power would come to the south in 2023, in my view, it would be most useful to put blackmail aside and focus on playing good politics. I support zoning but I also know that even without zoning, power can still shift to the south. Abiola did not win June 12 election by blackmailing anybody. He forged the right alliances nationwide over a long period of time. Abiola, from Ogun state, south-west Nigeria, defeated Alhaji Bashir Tofa in Kano state, north-west. Was it Yoruba voters or southerners that gave him victory in Kano state? The answer is obvious. Abiola aligned with the right power blocs. Also, Obasanjo did not win in the south-west in 1999 yet became president. Let\u2019s be guided.\n\nFinally, zoning to the south is one thing, micro-zoning within the region is another. Based on the \u201ctripod theory\u201d \u2014 the pre-Independence political structuring of Nigeria along Hausa/Fulani, Igbo and Yoruba ethnic classification \u2014 only the Igbo are yet to produce an elected president. A strong case has been built that on the basis of equity, the two biggest parties should concede their tickets to the Igbo. I do not have any problems with that. In fact, it would help actualise the Nigeria of my dream where no part will feel left behind because of any disadvantages \u2014 be they educational, historical, social, political or numerical. A president of Igbo origin would gladden my heart.\n\nSome issues will still crop up nonetheless. For one, the APC \u2014 the biggest party in Nigeria today \u2014 is very weak in the south-east. A counterargument would be that PDP was also weak in the south-west in 1999 and Obasanjo was still elected president. I doubt if the circumstances and dynamics of 1999 are similar to what we have today and I don\u2019t know if APC would want to take that risk. Also, if an Igbo from the south-south becomes presidential candidate of either APC or PDP or both, will the Igbo of the south-east finally feel accommodated? Meanwhile, APC presidential hopefuls from the south-west are not showing any signs of considering conceding to the south-south or south-east.\n\nI will now round up. The underlying factor behind the cat-and-mouse game between APC and PDP over zoning is cold political calculation. Both parties are strategising on how to get the largest share of the votes in the presidential election. But there is a bigger picture they must keep in focus. The basic point I would make here is that personal interests should not trump the cause of political stability. Zoning is in our DNA. We have made some progress in national integration through the application of federal character in sharing revenue, appointments, projects and what not, and I believe that power rotation can further help unify our troubled country. We are a work in progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nMOTLEY MASS\n\nNigeria\u2019s debts are doubling. Boko Haram keeps harming Chibok. ISWAP is sweeping the north-west. Bandits are butchering villagers en masse in Zamfara and Sokoto. IPOB wants to take the Igbo out of the Nigerian \u201czoo\u201d. Sunday Igboho, backed by professors, is saying give me Oduduwa Republic or I die. Crude oil is daily stolen in hundreds of thousands of barrels. ASUU is eternally on strike. Unemployment is sky-high. We cannot fund education, cannot build hospitals. Nigeria is broke. Yet, politicians are jostling like mad to become the next president. The ruling APC alone has about 100 million presidential aspirants. Is there something the politicians are not telling us? Wonderful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE GAME\n\nStill on the number of contestants for APC\u2019s presidential ticket, many Nigerians have been worried or even disgusted by the crowd. The N100 million price tag that is supposed to discourage them is appearing to be more of a magnet. We may not be able to explain all the reasons for the surge, but being a presidential contestant gives you some leverage. You are at the table when the negotiations and calculations are being made. In the end, you can be well positioned for appointments in the new dispensation \u2014 if APC wins. You can be minister, ambassador, agency head, etc. You can even be asked to nominate people into positions. Just be part of the process. The game is the game. Politics!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMIMICKING MTN\n\nThe next president will have many things to deal with, but accelerating the growth of the private sector must be paramount. The figures presented by Mr Karl Toriola, CEO of MTN Nigeria, at the LBS recently sent my head spinning. The telco alone has paid a total of N3.5trn in taxes and levies to government since 2002. That is about N1trn more than it has paid as dividends to its investors. Toriola said MTN has made over N3.4trn in capital investments, mostly sunk costs on building infrastructure and network roll-out. We need a business-conscious president who can drive unprecedented investment by the private sector. That will mean a lot for job creation. Crucial.\n\nLASSA ALERT\n\nI wish to draw our attention to the growing cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria. Because COVID-19 disrupted international travels and changed our way of living, we seem to have forgotten that there are other diseases still hanging around our necks. So far in 2022, Lassa has infected 751 Nigerians and claimed 140 lives, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). These are the confirmed cases. Some cases may never be captured officially. Lassa may not get many inches in the newspapers because it is associated with the poor \u2014 it is spread mainly by rodents \u2014 but it is in 22 states and killing human beings like us. Government needs to step up public enlightenment. Deadly.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anambra State Governor, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, has announced the appointment of Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency for a four-year tenure.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Agbata will be expected to use his experience to help the government achieve its plans of building a mega-city. This will include expanding broadband access, digitising government services, and supporting technology startups in the state.\n\nAgbata brings over a decade of experience working in the technology sector in different roles in the media and startup space, experience that he believes will serve him as he begins a new chapter.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on how his past will help him in his new role, Agbata said, \u201cWith my industry experience, I will be able to quickly launch new programs, attract the right partners, strengthen the tech and developer communities, organise programmes and meetups, and tons of other initiatives and activities that will benefit both Anambra State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgbata\u2019s mandate will tie neatly into the state government\u2019s mission to make Anambra the digital and creative capital of Nigeria. Through the Soludo Solution, the state plans to train and support up to 10,000 youth annually while setting up a five billion venture capital fund to incubate and provide growth capital for startups.\n\nMuch of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector has been seen in Lagos State. However, growth in the industry needs to be spread across more cities if the country\u2019s unemployment rate is to be reduced.\n\nWith ICT\u2019s growing contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, some states have taken steps to take advantage of this trend.\n\nIn 2020, the Edo State Government launched the Edo Innovation Hub. The hub provides a place for state residents to convene and potentially build technological products.\n\nLast year, it inaugurated a board with Victor Asemota, SwiftaCorp Co-founder as its chairman; and Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President on Digital Transformation, as a member.\n\nAlready, the state has partnered with tech talent accelerator, Decagon in a project that plans to train 15,000 residents of the state in software development and is an attempt to follow and potentially leapfrog Lagos State as a top destination for technological innovation.\n\nOne factor that has aided the rise of Lagos as a tech hub is the existing infrastructure absent in most states in the country.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the South Eastern region of Nigeria, where Anambra State is, has the lowest Internet penetration rates, with 13.7 million users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing the number of residents connected to the Internet will be vital in achieving the government\u2019s goals. Already, the previous government has set the ball rolling by waiving the right-of-way charges for telcos in the state, paving the way for the new government to build on it.\n\nIn Agbata\u2019s experience and Soludo\u2019s previous experience as a Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the state could become a digital powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be learning about the Web3 from experts. Isn\u2019t this something you should look forward to too?\n\nInterestingly, Bolu highlighted five ways we can learn Web3 at the Summit here: 5 ways to learn about Web3 at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass up this opportunity to learn from great minds. To attend, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nProblems YC-backed startups are solving\n\nTikTok\u2019s Pulse\n\nTigerrise\u2019s plan to improve mental health\n\nWhat problems are YC-backed startups solving?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe you\u2019ve been seeing Y Combinator (YC) posts in our newsletter for over a week now. And I understand how tiring it can be to see the same thing repeatedly.\n\nDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m about to change that. This is a new story. And, I won\u2019t bore you. You\u2019d tell me if I was, won\u2019t you? \ud83e\udd14\n\nKeep in mind that Chimgozirim had a chat with the founders of Y Combinator (YC) in March 2022 and told us how they work. Please read it here: Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows more interest in East and North Africa\n\nBesides, on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, we issued a report indicating the following:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can, of course, download the report here. It\u2019s completely free.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s crucial to note that 95 African companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, roughly half of which are 51 fintechs from Nigeria. Most importantly, it\u2019s also critical to ask questions such as, \u201cWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve?\u201d\n\nAccording to our data, these startups are active in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics. So, again, what problem are they attempting to address?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, is likely to have an answer to your question. Please look at it here: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\n\nTikTok to split ad revenue with creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall this: Meta needs to get over TikTok? Interestingly, TikTok appears to be upping its game, leaving Meta with no breathing room. Maybe some sleepless nights for Meta in the coming days?\n\nWhy? TikTok has introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that will allow brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nIsn\u2019t this fantastic news for TikTok Pulse creators? To put things into perspective, ad revenue will be split 50/50 between creators and publishers. This is similar to what YouTube offers creators, who reportedly receive a 55% cut.\n\nNow, you\u2019re interested, aren\u2019t you? But there\u2019s a catch: TikTok says p,m Pulse will be available only to creators and publishers with at least 100,000 followers, and even then, ads will only appear alongside \u201cthe top 4% of all TikTok videos.\u201d\n\nMoreover, TikTok\u2019s Pulse will also ensure that creator content is \u201csuitable\u201d for advertisements.\n\nThis means that Pulse will allow brands to target their ads to specific areas of TikTok. Brands can use Pulse to place ads alongside videos in 12 different categories, including beauty, fashion, pets, gaming, TV & movies, auto, Spanish language, sports and recreation, and more.\n\nFor the time being, this feature will be available to a select group of users in the United States beginning in June 2022. And sometime in September 2022, more countries.\n\nTigerrise to improve mental health access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emily Underworld on Unsplash\n\nIn Africa, mental health care is scarce. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), 75-95% of people with mental illnesses do not have any access to appropriate care in low and middle-income countries.\n\nTo back up this claim, Kenya\u2019s health ministry reports that 75% of people in need of mental health services cannot obtain them. Knowing the stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses in Africa, I don\u2019t think this is breaking news.\n\nWhy? Studies have shown that Kenyans suffering from mental illnesses are frequently stigmatised on several levels.\n\nConsequently, Tigerrise \u2014 a company which uses data-driven insights to disrupt the delivery of health and wellness services positively \u2014 has partnered with the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nMoreso, it has received a $1 million grant to empower Kenyan youth to take charge of their mental and physical health to increase access to mental health care in Kenya.\n\nWhat\u2019s in for Kenyans? Over the next three years, the Elton John AIDS Foundation\u2019s $1 million grant will ensure that all Triggerise-affiliated clinics in Mombasa, Kenya, provide mental health screening and services ranging from individual and group counselling to trauma-based care.\n\nMoreover, these services will be fully integrated with Triggerise\u2019s existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for young people aged 15 to 24.\n\nSince seamless access to SRH is critical for this age group, the collaboration will ensure that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services are part of Triggerise\u2019s established offerings in Mombasa.\n\nRichard Matikanya, Triggerise\u2019s Chief Operating Officer said, \u201cThe timing of this investment is particularly exciting, as the growing mental health burden among young people in their diversity \u2014 particularly those living with HIV \u2014 has largely been overlooked. Our partnership will allow us to contribute to the evidence base on how to ensure that young people have access to mental health services that respond to their needs on their terms.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LOOK LIKE?\n\nChange: an Opportunity rather than a Fear\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d \u2014 and other lies I\u2019ve loved\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to state that technology and exposure have changed how startups operate in Nigeria. After its first entry with Senegal\u2019s Wave, Y Combinator, one of the most prestigious accelerators in the world today, has gained increasing prominence in Africa.\n\nResearch from the good folks at Intelligence by Techpoint, our data and research team, has shown that African startups, on average, enter YC within a year or two of launch.\n\nIn March 2005, four illustrious professionals decided to start a company that would change how venture capitalists (VCs) invest in startups. With a seed fund of $150,000, the company took in the likes of Reddit in its first batch and has gone on to fund an enviable list of startups, including Stripe, Airbnb, and OpenSea.\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Y Combinator has seemingly increased its focus on Africa annually. This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Nigerian startups have dominated the scenes, gravitating towards the accelerator. Little wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria. Egypt comes in at a distant second with 12 startups, while Kenya rounds up the top three countries with 9 startups.\n\nDifferent interested parties have reasons for Nigeria\u2019s seeming dominance in YC, but it\u2019s not so surprising for the accelerator.\n\nKat Manalac, Head of Outreach at Y Combinator, points out that when one company from a region goes through YC, gets featured in the press, and raises money after demo day, more founders from that region start applying the following year.\n\n\u201cWe saw this in 2014 with Algolia \u2014 the Algolia founders were some of YC\u2019s first French founders. They went through YC in Winter 2014, and in the following batch, we saw 17 French founders go through the program. This is what started happening with African companies after Paystack went through the batch,\u201d she says.\n\nCombined, Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups had raised $1.3 billion as of March 2021, with two of them \u2014 Wave and Flutterwave \u2014 reaching a billion-dollar valuation. Paystack, another huge success story, was acquired by Stripe, a US-based payments startup, for $200 million in 2020.\n\nThese headline-grabbing stories appear to show investor attraction for YC-backed companies. For most investors, getting into YC means that a startup now has a higher valuation. But the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\n\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\n\nWhile this might be the most obvious question, I guess we should have framed it thus: What problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve? Why? To use the Nigerian parlance, \u201cProblem nor dey finish\u201d, which simply means problems are never ending.\n\nOur data shows that these startups are playing in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll work our way up from the industries with the least focus to the ones with the most focus for this article. We found some startups working in some unexpected industries, but you\u2019ll have to download the report to find out.\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms are together because each sector has only one YC-backed startup trying to solve its problems. This is hardly surprising, considering that only 5% ($245m) of the $4.9 billion African startups raised in 2021 went to the Education sector.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s education startups didn\u2019t get up to 3% of startup funding in 2020 ($1.07 billion), Media and Telecoms did not make any notable imprint on the funding numbers for 2021 and 2020.\n\nThese startups have raised a combined $7.2 million and are seemingly making decent strides in their respective industries.\n\nIn 2021, the African Union reported that there were 42 million out-of-school children in Africa, with 40% of this number coming from West Africa. Six out of ten Africans are still without access to the Internet, and affordability remains a big issue for those who have access.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are huge capital-intensive sectors and might not be appealing to the fast-paced, high-growth nature of modern startups. But we might just be an innovative execution away from the problem. Easier said than done, we know. As for media? That\u2019s a different ball game entirely.\n\nOther sectors like Real Estate and Marketing also feature in this group.\n\nEnergy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, two Energy startups have gone through the prestigious accelerator programme and closed a combined $22 million to date. Slightly better than the three industries above, renewable energy solutions have attracted decent funding in Africa.\n\nWhile it only accounted for 5% ($245 million) of funding in 2021, it took 22% of funding in the previous year. A cursory glance at the numbers, which show that 43% of Africans didn\u2019t have access to electricity as of 2019, evidently points to a vast untapped market.\n\nLike Telecoms, this is also capital intensive, and from what we\u2019ve observed, several renewable energy solutions are barely affordable for the average (or even upper-middle-class) African.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all its classes and tasty nutrients, food is an integral part of society. So far, YC has funded three startups looking to provide tech-enabled solutions for food security in Africa, and they have secured a combined $64 million.\n\nLike the previous industries, it appears there\u2019s a low investor appetite for startups building agriculture solutions across the continent. Agriculture startups accounted for 4% of funding in 2021, lower than 7% in 2020.\n\nAccording to world vision, 282 million people are undernourished in Africa, and that\u2019s just one result of several underlying problems. While food prices keep rising, 37% of food produced gets wasted.\n\nMobility & Logistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility & Logistics is at the heart of commerce and nearly everything we do. To date, six African Mobility & Logistics startups have gone through YC, raising $94.6 million. A trend we observed is that most of these startups are based in North Africa, with roughly 30% from Nigeria.\n\nRecent funding announcements have shown a renewed interest in eCommerce in North Africa. Overall, Mobility & Logistics companies accounted for 10% of the total funding in 2021, a marginal improvement from 7% in 2020.\n\nWhen we split both sectors, we\u2019ll find that most of these companies are logistics companies. Mobility startups, on the other hand, have not raised as much.\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nAfrica\u2019s Health sector is huge not for its number of hospitals and medical infrastructure but for the number of problems waiting to be solved. Everything, from preventive healthcare, telemedicine, health insurance, and precision medicine, represents critical areas in Africa.\n\nY Combinator has invested in eight African Health startups that have bagged a combined $115 million. These startups offer diverse healthcare solutions in preventive healthcare, health insurance, cancer diagnostics, medical logistics, and precision medicine.\n\nNine out of the top ten causes of death in Africa are health-related problems that run pretty deep. While healthcare startups are emerging, their services are mainly meant for a particular class, so it\u2019s hard to see how they can reach the mass market without significant regulatory backing.\n\nHealth startups accounted for 8% of 2021\u2019s funding, not improving on 9% in 2020. While technology is great, there are other serious considerations beyond its scope \u2014 for now at least.\n\nMarketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace startups have grown in popularity in recent years, and platforms that simply offer the technology to connect sellers to buyers are popping up with diverse execution strategies. So far, YC has invested in 17 startups looking to help Africans buy and sell online.\n\nConsidering the well-documented struggles of Jumia and Konga, questions abound on the viability of eCommerce startups in Africa. But these questions have not stopped YC-backed African eCommerce startups from bagging $138 million to date.\n\nOverall, eCommerce startups have accounted for 3% and 5% of funding in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also noteworthy is that an increasing number of eCommerce startups are now serving businesses rather than consumers directly.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services startups are the cream of the crop and the most popular sector by almost any metric in use. It has attracted the most funding and, perhaps, the most media attention for the past four years.\n\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni. They\u2019ve collectively raised over $854 million, about 65% of the total funding raised by Africa\u2019s YC alumni.\n\nHowever, this trend is not peculiar to YC. Fintech companies accounted for 62% of funding in 2021, mainly due to megadeals from Flutterwave and Chipper Cash. In the preceding year, fintechs grabbed 33% of funding, still much higher than any other sector.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons for the prominence of fintech companies. Over half of the continent\u2019s population does not have access to formal financial services. As of 2020, the median age of Africans was 19.7 \u2014 this means half of the population was younger, and half of the population was older.\n\nMost fintech companies\u2019 efforts do not seem geared toward improving financial inclusion but rather promising a better experience for people who already have bank accounts. However, the jury is still out on how successful they\u2019ve been.\n\nPayments, for instance, have witnessed the most advancement. With the exploits of Paystack and Flutterwave, API-led fintechs are changing how financial companies communicate, but nearly every other sub-sector is still in the early stages.\n\nWhy is the focus on fintech?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we fund is typically a reflection of what strong teams are applying with,\u201d says YC\u2019s Manalac, in response to our question on fintech\u2019s evident dominance.\n\nManalac\u2019s assertion suggests that the company does not deliberately look out for fintech companies, but it receives several applications from founders offering financial services solutions.\n\n\u201cThat payments lead the way shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because it is a primary pain point for all human beings irrespective of where you are, and is one area that technology has proven that it can build solutions for,\u201d says Adesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier/SSA Banks & Fintech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital.\n\nPelumi Aboluwarin, CTO of Nigeria\u2019s Nomba (formerly Kudi), maintains that running a business is hard, so payments shouldn\u2019t be difficult too. Perseus Mlamba, CEO, Zambia\u2019s Union54, also argues that payment is the key to unlocking innovations in health, agriculture, and industry.\n\nWhile both founders run prominent financial services startups, Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of Releaf, a Nigerian Agritech startup, agrees.\n\n\u201cFintech was the first piece of our growing innovation story so it makes sense that most of the investment and attention so far has gone to that sector. However, as innovation from more sectors emerges, I believe we will see a more diverse split.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, we can safely say that YC-backed companies are mainly looking to solve problems in finance, eCommerce, logistics, and Healthcare. As these entrepreneurs gain more experience, we should better understand how these tech solutions could be best applied in an African context. As the founders we spoke to explained, going through YC is just the beginning.\n\nLooking to understand how YC\u2019s activities are changing Africa\u2019s startup landscape? We spoke to some prominent entrepreneurs who have gone through the accelerator to gain insights. Watch this space on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "summary": "This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\nLittle wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria.\nBut the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni.",

This year and every year, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and partners work together to develop solutions and ideas for lowering barriers to access and improving safety online for girls and young women.\n\nThe event held at the newly launched Microsoft facility in Lagos with young girls from Girls Senior Secondary Grammar School Obalende, Ikoyi Lagos, female tech enthusiasts as well as 30 ladies under 30 with no prior tech knowledge all in attendance. This audience were treated to inspiring conversations, one-on-one sessions with mentors, a tour of the office facility, and an introduction to skilling pathways in technology.\n\nOn their part, the 30 ladies under 30 who attended the observance without an academic degree or career in tech left with renewed energy willing to pursue careers in tech and software engineering.\n\nHosted by Sefunmi Wande-Durojaye, Lead Ecosystem and Program Development at Microsoft ADC-West Africa, the observance sparked conversations in ICT for girls during the day-long event, with a keynote address delivered by Bolanle Olumekor, Knowledge Management Assistant at United Nations Information Centre Nigeria.\n\nParticipants had the opportunity to hear inspiring and insightful speeches from the speakers during the sessions. Paula Wigwe, Business Manager at Microsoft ADC-West Africa, shared a relatable story of how she got into tech even though her first degree was in Estate Management. Her story had a lot to do with her curiosity, resilience and being focused.\n\nBeyond the significance of internet access and safety for young women, the day was leveraged as another channel to inspire young women interested in STEM to dream and believe in a future at Microsoft like many women, they had the opportunity to meet. Jacquelyn Ekwueme, Senior Program Manager in the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), and Adora Nwodo, Software Engineer in Mixed Reality, shared their experiences on ways to become a voice and remain relevant within the tech industry.\n\nPer opportunities in skill advancement, Microsoft ADC West Africa partnered with Utiva and Skillup Africa to help the females in skilling up toward their career journey in tech.\n\nOther notable sessions during the day included a career session anchored by Tejumade Olaniyi, Recruiter at the ADC West Africa and an experience at the Garage led by Lydiah Karanja, Program Manager of the Garage, ADC East Africa.\n\nThe Garage session gave the participants the opportunity to try their hands on a few projects, bringing home how very accessible and fun tech can be for young women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "The Board of Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) Plc has proposed a total dividend of N3.7Billion to its shareholders, reinforcing the value accretion to its equity owners, who have seen notable rise in share price of the Company over the past year.\n\nThe dividend proposal, which was announced at the Company\u2019s 28th Annual General Meeting that took place today at the Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos on Friday, May 2022, was unanimously approved by elated shareholders, who commended the Executive Management for an incredible performance, despite the challenging operating environment.\n\nThe N3.7Billion dividend, which translates to 83.7% payout ratio, reflects the resilient profitability of the Company, notwithstanding the impact of lower trading activity on most Exchanges in the Nigerian capital market and inflationary pressures. Consolidating on its diligent earnings diversification drive, the Company grew revenue from core operations and ancillary services by 39.2% to N6.4Billion from N4.6Billion in 2020, as it almost quadrupled earnings from ancillary services from N526million in 2020 financial year to N2.2Billion in 2021 financial year.\n\nNotably, income from ancillary services contributed 33.3% and 21.5% of operating revenue and total income for the year respectively, underpinning Management\u2019s strategy towards diversifying and strengthening the earnings fundamentals of the Company, with the ultimate objective of creating sustainable and superior wealth for shareholders and its broader stakeholders.\n\nAddressing shareholders, Mr. Oscar Onyema OON, Chairman, Board of Directors of CSCS Plc said; \u201cNotwithstanding the volatile operating environment and moderated capital flows, as reflected in the subdued capital market activities, the earnings fundamentals of your Company remained resilient and indeed stronger than ever.\n\n\u201cThis fact is evident in the impressive revenue growth of 39.2%, driven by stellar growth in ancillary income. The equity market recorded one of the weakest secondary market activities in the past few years, with the average daily trade value of N3.9billion, some 10% below the trading activity recorded in 2020 financial year, explaining the tepid transaction fees. Albeit income from ancillary services recorded a significant boost, contributing N2.2billion or 21.5% of total income in 2021FY, from N526million or 11.3% of total income in 2020FY. This performance reinforces the capacity of the Management in delivering on the Board\u2019s vision result of diversifying the business and enhancing the value accretion prospect to shareholders in a sustainable manner. More importantly, my colleagues and I on the Board of your Company, are excited at the prospect for new offerings arising from strategic partnerships and new initiatives. In our oversight role, we are working with the Management to invest relevant resources towards exploring new frontiers for growth, especially as these initiatives are expected to foster retail investor penetration and broader capital market growth.\u201d\n\nWhile commenting on the outlook for the business, the Chairman noted: \u201ctypical of a pre-election year, 2022 comes with its unique macro challenges but I am optimistic on the earnings capacity and overall resilience of our business, as we hope to consolidate on the strong foundations and extract synergies opportunities with our participants and partners in sustaining the positive trajectory of the business. Hence, with the support of shareholders and other stakeholders, CSCS would continue to deliver superior performance and create wealth for shareholders.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Mr. Haruna Jalo-Waziri, the Chief Executive Officer, CSCS Plc said; \u201cReflecting the ingenuity of our participants and more importantly quick adoption of new remote access technologies, the Nigerian capital market remained active through the prolonged COVID-19 crisis. The collaboration of our regulator and participants has been incredible in sustaining our operational protocols and IOSCO PFMI standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough clearing and settlement activity waned by 10.2% due to lower participation of foreign investors in the Nigerian equity market and a host of macro challenges, we are excited at the growth in our depository assets by 6.1% to N23.0trillion, reflecting new listings of securities across our multiple Exchange partners as well as issuers\u2019 and investors\u2019 confidence in the safety and secured accessibility of our systems.\n\nContinuing, Mr. Jalo-Waziri said: \u201cDespite the average inflation rate of 17.0% during the year, we sustained our cost efficiency strategy, leading to a 1.6% decline in operating expenses. Overall, we achieved N5.8Billion and N4.4Billion Profit Before Tax and Profit After Tax respectively, underpinning the resilience of the business and commitment of my colleagues and I, in delivering on our pledge to sustainably create value for shareholders and our broader ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt has been twenty-five years of meritorious service, as the infrastructure for the Nigerian capital market. We have pioneered a number of initiatives and efficiencies in the market and have enjoyed the best of collaborative engagements with different stakeholders. Whilst we relish our progress working with other stakeholders in transforming the Nigerian capital market, we reckon there is a long way to go in bridging the gap towards our aspiration of positioning the Nigerian capital market as the hub of securities services in Africa and one of the leading capital markets, globally. To this end, we have reinvigorated our strategic thrust with the development of a medium-term playbook that would enhance our capabilities in executing new initiatives towards deepening the Nigerian capital market and strengthening our business growth frontiers for the mutual prosperity of all our stakeholders.\u201d",

We need to send fascism back to the sewer of history, where it should have been all along,\u201d he told a cheering crowd of thousands, calling on \u201call democrats\u201d to join him.\n\nIt was hardly a secret Lula, who has enjoyed a long \u2014 though shrinking \u2014 lead in the polls, would jump into the campaign, which does not officially start until August.\n\nHe has been in unofficial campaign mode since March last year, when the Supreme Court annulled the corruption convictions that sidelined him from politics.\n\nThe ruling instantly set up this year\u2019s elections as a polarizing clash between arch-enemies Lula and Bolsonaro.\n\nSurprise return\n\nLula left office with approval ratings of 87 percent, after presiding over a golden period that lifted some 30 million Brazilians from poverty.\n\nBut the onetime shoeshine boy\u2019s towering legacy came crashing down with the explosion of \u201cOperation Car Wash,\u201d a sweeping investigation that uncovered a massive corruption scheme centered on state-run oil company Petrobras.\n\nLula, who calls the case a conspiracy, was convicted on bribe-taking charges and jailed from April 2018 to November 2019 \u2014 missing the 2018 presidential race, which Bolsonaro won.\n\nIn a Brazil deeply divided over Bolsonaro\u2019s combative style, social media polemics, weak performance on the economy and chaotic handling of Covid-19, Lula returned to the ring with the immediate status of front-runner.\n\nSlipping poll numbers\n\nBut Bolsonaro, 67, has narrowed the gap in the latest polls \u2014 and made it clear he won\u2019t leave power without a fight.\n\nLula has meanwhile made a series of recent gaffes, including politically tone-deaf remarks on abortion, the police and the middle class.\n\nHe has also looked out of sync with world leaders he aspires to rub elbows with again \u2014 saying, for example, that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is \u201cas responsible as\u201d Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin for the Ukraine war.\n\nLula has reportedly shaken up his campaign team recently, removing long-time ally Franklin Martins as communications chief.\n\n\u201cHe has made several disastrous statements in recent weeks,\u201d Sylvio Costa, founder of news site Congresso em Foco, told AFP.\n\n\u201cAnd, above all, Lula needs to go to the street.\u201d\n\nThe Workers\u2019 Party founder said he would now do just that, crisscrossing the country to meet with \u201cthe people.\u201d\n\nWearing a sharp navy suit, his shirt open at the collar, Lula stuck strictly to the script at his rally, rather than speaking off the cuff as he typically does.\n\nBut he was short on tangible planks for his platform.\n\n\u201cInstead of promises, I present the immense legacy of our administration,\u201d he said.\n\nCourting the wary business sector and seeking to build a broad base, Lula has tapped market-friendly centrist Geraldo Alckmin \u2014 the opponent he defeated in the 2006 presidential race \u2014 as his running-mate.\n\n\u201cBrazil today has the most disastrous and cruel government in its history. Lula is our only hope,\u201d Alckmin, a former Sao Paulo governor who was home with a mild case of Covid-19, told the rally by video link.\n\nCheering the veteran leftist on, 63-year-old retiree Odilon da Silva Freire agreed.\n\n\u201cLula governed for everyone, especially the poor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe has to be president again.

It is a conspiracy against the South by the North for the two major parties, PDP and APC to project Northern candidates in 2023\u2033.\n\nCD said this is a calculation of underestimation on the part of the North to attempt to take advantage of the South.\n\nThe group urged the South West governors to call on the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to consider zoning ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nIt also called on PDP leaders to pick their candidate from the South, stressing that \u201d It is a pandora box yet to be unlocked if the two leading parties fail to allow other ethnic nationalities to produce the president at their due time. It will coast the country into yet another crisis that may sink the entire nation\u201d\n\nCD added that anyone in his right senses should know that jetisoning power shift to the South is a direct invitation to serious civil strife that may lead to outright balkanization of the country.\n\n\u201cOur Politicians should reminisce on the past political events, how political and religious intolerance and impatience has caused our illustrious sons and daughters their early death. It is on record that political, religious and ethnic chauvinism accelerated the death of Chief MKO Abiola, General Sani Abacha, Rear Admiral Elegbede, Alhaja Suliat, Mrs Kudirat Abiola and a host of other prominent Nigerians who were massacred between 1993 and 1999.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we draw the line by sounding another warning to the politicians to play the chess game with all sense of maturity and patriotism so that Nigeria will not be returned to another evil days of the military rule, because democracy can only be enduring if its managers are fair to one another, to their conscience and to the nation\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, on the last day of his two-day working visit to Ebonyi State, told leaders of the South-east geo-political zone that the court would determine the fate of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra\u2019s leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe Igbo leaders, during a meeting with the President at the Government House, Abakaliki, had pleaded with Buhari to release Kanu.\n\nThe Chairman, South-East Traditional Rulers Council, Eze Charles Mkpuma, delivered the plea.\n\nResponding, the President said: \u2018\u2018I have listened carefully to the various appeals from the elders to the traditional leaders regarding a wide range of options, and as I have said previously, this matter remains in the full purview of the courts where it will be properly adjudicated.\n\n\u201cMy worry is for our hardworking and innocent civilians, for whom life is already tough and would like to earn a decent and honest living.\n\n\u2018\u2018There are many that fit this profile and the government owes them that obligation to protect lives and property.\n\n\u2018\u2018I will once again repeat, no one has the right to carry an AK-47, and anyone seen in any part of the country doing so and is not a law enforcement officer is a threat to our peaceful coexistence and should be treated as such.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari pledged his administration\u2019s readiness to protect innocent and hardworking Nigerians from terrorists and those causing break down of law and order in the South East zone.\n\nHe expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in the region, reiterating his directive to security agencies to \u201cflush out\u201d those perpetrating violence in the land.\n\nHe said: \u201cI must register my deep and grave concern with regards to the deteriorating state of security affairs in this region.\n\n\u201cIn the last 48 hours, I have been informed of the latest in the round of brutal actions carried out by gun-wielding terrorists, who prey on innocent and hardworking citizens. Unfortunately, these barbaric acts were visited upon those who have committed their lives to protect their fellow citizens.\u201d\n\nThe President paid tribute to members of the Nigerian Armed Forces who recently lost their lives in the region.\n\nOn infrastructure, President Buhari highlighted some of his government\u2019s achievements in the zone, dismissing those peddling false narratives of lack of care and consideration for the people of the South-east by this administration\n\nThe President said he was proud of the reconstruction of the runway of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport and ongoing upgrade of the International Terminal Building, assuring Ndigbo that the N200 billion Second Niger Bridge and 10km six-lane expressway in Onitsha and Asaba would be completed before the end of the year.\n\nHe added that the $5.5 million Diagnostic Centre in Umuahia was already operational.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State said President Buhari would be remembered as a man who did not use the plight of the people of the South-east to play politics, but came to their rescue severally.\n\nThe governor urged South Eastern leaders to work towards finding a political solution in resolving some challenging issues, warning that the region was at \u201ccrossroads.\u201d\n\nUmahi said: \u201cOn this issue of a political solution, I have never believed in IPOB\u2019s method of operation, I disagree with them, but we have gotten ourselves to a very terrible and pitiable situation.\n\n\u201cSome of us warned that we will get to this situation and some were playing politics with it.\n\n\u201cMr. President, we are at a crossroads. I have been to you and I have begged you for a political solution. Surprisingly and graciously, you granted that. You said our people should initiate that and at the forefront is Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer.\u201d\n\nThe governor, therefore, urged the President of Ohaneze Ndigbo to meet with elder statesman, Mbazuluike Amaechi, the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), South East, the Chairman of South East Traditional Rulers Council, Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer and a few others to initiate the political solution.\n\nOn the forthcoming 2023 elections, Umahi said he believed strongly in the demand for the presidency to be zoned to the South-east region on the basis of fairness, equity, justice and morality.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor, who is also a presidential aspirant, commended some leaders from outside the region for expressing their support for the next president of Nigeria to emerge from the South-east.\n\nThe Chairman of South-east Traditional Rulers, Eze Charles Mkpuma and CAN Chairman, South-east, Very Rev. Fr. Abraham Nwali, also spoke in favour of the President of Nigeria of South East extraction come 2023.\n\nThe leaders, while expressing support for a united Nigeria, appealed to the President to grant pardon and release the IPOB leader, urging other agitators to cease all forms of hostilities.\n\nThe Ohanaeze had in a statement on Tuesday hoped that Buhari\u2019s visit to Ebonyi State would kick-start the process to get Kanu freed.\n\nThe Igbo socio-cultural organisation, in the statement said, \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has given assurances of peace and security ahead of the planned presidential visit to Ebonyi State.\n\nKanu is standing trial on an amended 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony.\n\nIn April, a federal high court in Abuja struck out eight out of the 15-count charge filed against the IPOB leader.\n\nMike Ozekhome, Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, described the charges as \u201cdefective and baseless.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
