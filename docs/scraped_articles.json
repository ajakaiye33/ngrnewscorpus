          "text": "The Nigeria Inter-Religious Council on Thursday condemned the killing of a former Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in the Sumaila Local Government Area of Kano State, Pastor Shuaibu Yohanna, by suspected fundamentalists in the Masu community.\n\nThe group called on security agents to investigate the incident and get the perpetrators arrested.\n\nNIREC, in a statement by its Executive Secretary, Fr. Prof. Cornelius Omonokhua, titled, \u2018Press release on the murder of Pastor Shuaibu Yohanna,\u2019 said the deceased pastored the New Life for All Nations Church in Masu for about 10 years.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cNIREC condemns the killing of the pastor, the attack on the church building, school, staff office and the destruction of his house. No reason can justify this criminality.\n\n\u201cNIREC therefore condoles with the family of Pastor Shuaibu Yohanna and prays that God grant him eternal repose. We pray that those arrested and all those involved in this criminal act must be seen to be dealt with in accordance with the law of the land.\n\n\u201cNIREC appeals to the Kano State Command of the Nigeria Police Force to honestly do the needful.

          "text": "THE leadership of the Indigenous People of Biafra has said governors of the South-East geopolitical zone and the elite in the region were too infinitesimal to decide the fate of the Igbo.\n\nThe group also noted that alleged plans by governors of the zone to launch counter-secessionist groups, was dead on arrival, claiming that the people had lost confidence in them.\n\nThe secessionist group reacted to the statement credited to the Chairman, South-East Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, who said leaders of the zone was comfortable sticking with Nigeria than move to Biafra.\n\nThe governor had also said counter-secessionist groups would arise if IPOB did not stop killings in the zone.\n\nBut IPOB, in a statement by its Director of Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, on Thursday lashed out at the governors.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWe wish to remind South-East governors that their disgraceful plan of creating another group to checkmate IPOB is dead on arrival. The people have lost confidence in them and just as their imaginary Ebube Agu security outfit, no such faceless group can survive in the South-East.\n\n\u201cBut we want to remind South-East governors and the Igbo political elite that they represent less than one percent of the Biafran population. The rest of over 99% of the people earnestly ask for Biafra, and the train has long left the station.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the South-East governors are the ones contemplating to create anarchy in the region. Now, we can see the real sponsors of the festering insecurity in the region.\n\n\u201cThe world is still in shock of that act where Nigerian police killed Nigerian DSS as unknown gunmen who are terrorising innocent citizens and tagged him as ESN and IPOB.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Evans Akere: Innovating African Traditional Wear",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nSince launching his fashion line, Creative Director and CEO of Vanskere, Evans Akere, has become one of the major brands saddled with the responsibility of making African traditional wear acceptable worldwide.\n\nA lawyer by training, his passion and love for fashion, has made his home-grown brand a premium lifestyle brand for men. Renowned for its obsession with craftsmanship, the basic goal Evans says has always been to make stylish and comfortable clothes, a major factor for the brand\u2019s success so far.\n\nWith a clientele list that boasts of politicians, corporate executives and A-list celebrities, Vanskere continues to bridge the market gap for classic, yet, in-trend occasion wear garments tailored for today\u2019s man. Here, he talks about switching from law to the needle profession, the birth of his latest Afro-Athleisure collection- Signore Fusion by Vanskere, (a collection inspired by the COVID19 lockdown) that is now a brand on its own, challenges in the industry and the Nigeria of his dreams.\n\nYou read law in the university, at what point did you embrace fashion?\n\nThat was when I was studying law. I found out that something was not right. I found it difficult to fit in as a law student because I was too elaborate in my dressing. Back then, as a law student, you had to dress corporate in black and white but I like to express myself in my dressing. I like colours.\n\nI remember when I was in law school during my compulsory court attachments, I was actually walked out of court by a Senior Advocate because of the way I was dressed. I wore a purple shirt and a purple tie to court. The judge wanted to take it up that I will not graduate from Law School. I never practiced law or went to court.\n\nI finally made up my mind to do fashion after my call to the Bar. I did not practice.\n\nHow did the VANSKERE brand come to be and how has the brand evolved over the years?\n\nThe VANSKERE brand came to be as a result of my love for fashion. Although I was trained as a lawyer, my passion for fashion supersedes that of law, which made me abandon law. VANSKERE is an abbreviation of my first and last name. It was my nickname from my teenage days. So when it was time for me to set up, it was only logical that I registered the name as the brand name.\n\nThe brand has evolved over the years from a basic fashion brand, to a Luxury fashion brand, with emphasis on modern African traditional wear.\n\nWhat have been your weirdest sources of inspiration for your brand and design direction?\n\nLike I have always said, inspiration is divine, it\u2019s indescribable, and it comes naturally. For an artist, anything can be a source of inspiration. For me, my weirdest source of inspiration has been from lines, curves, and angles.\n\nThe Vanskere brand is fun, but there is also a classic appeal to your apparel. How do you strike an appropriate balance between classic and contemporary?\n\nIt has been easy striking a balance between classic and contemporary fashion because we understand the brand, its core value, and target market. We know it\u2019s imperative that we maintain and sustain our conservative nature, while also meeting the needs of our fashionable customers.\n\nWhat would you consider the biggest challenge as a fashion entrepreneur?\n\nMy biggest challenge from day one has always been how to manage my tailors. In Nigeria, there is a lack of efficient tailors, the few available ones are either not loyal or are badly behaved.\n\nHow have you managed this problem over the years?\n\nManaging tailors is a big challenge like I said, the majority of them are not loyal. If you are lucky, you might have one or two who are, but majority of them are not. It\u2019s more challenging when you have a big factory with many of them; you\u2019ll need to be strong mentally and physically to survive each day. Even when you have a factory manager, majority of the issues still end up on your table.\n\nTo stay above board, I see it as a business hazard that I have to endure daily. So, I\u2019m prepared and ready to face them when I come to work each day.\n\nYou have worked in the fashion industry for quite some years now, what is the best lesson you have learned along the way?\n\nMy best lesson so far would be never to design clothes that suit only my personal style.\n\nHow would you describe the fashion industry in Nigeria today? What would you say are the challenges and way forward?\n\nThe industry has definitely grown over the years, more Nigerians are beginning to appreciate locally made clothes and this has increased the level of patronage. The majority of Nigerian designers have stepped up their game, creating beautiful designs with impeccable finishing. But, there is still a lot of work to be done for our clothes to get that global recognition like we see in the music and movie industry.\n\nThere are lots of challenges in the industry, one of the major one, is lack of a steady power supply; without electricity we can\u2019t produce. A lot of the money we make is spent on buying generators and maintaining them, funds that should have been ploughed back into the business. We don\u2019t even have the enabling environment for business growth and expansion. Basic infrastructures are not available. We do not have textile industries, everything we use including the fabrics are imported. There are no colleges of fashion, only a few institutions offer fashion designing as a course. I could go on and on, but I think the way forward would be for our government to invest in the industry and create an enabling environment.\n\nThe fashion industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. How has the pandemic impacted the Vanskere brand? What was your strategy for staying afloat during the lockdown?\n\nThe pandemic did hit hard on almost every business, but we thank God that the impact wasn\u2019t so hard on the Vanskere brand. We realised that it wasn\u2019t business as usual; we were in an unusual time, so we needed to do the business in an unusual manner. We started off by making face masks for individuals and later scaled up to companies. The sales from the face masks were unbelievable, we couldn\u2019t believe how much we made from it. Then came the easing of lockdown measures; we discovered that most companies were working remotely, while the majority of their staff were working from home. There were no parties and events. Based on this, there was a decline in the purchase of clothes. Then the idea came from our PR team to create comfortable and more casual clothes that could be worn indoors while working and outdoors when socialising. This idea gave birth to the Afro-Athleisure collection under the auspices of our diffusion line \u2013 Signore Fusion by Vanskere. The collection became a huge success and this has become one of our best business decisions in a while. As a result, Signore Fusion is now a brand on its own.\n\nWhat do you love most about what you do?\n\nEverything, I love everything about fashion. I like to study and predict trends; I love to sketch designs and shop for fabrics. I also like to play a major role in the production aspect of the designs.\n\nWhat do you think makes one a successful fashion designer?\n\nI think what makes one a successful fashion designer is the ability to manage change. As a designer, you must have the ability to envisage change, dictate and move with trends.\n\nTell us a bit about your growing up years and what informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nI was born in Edo State. I had my primary and secondary education in Benin-City. My Dad was a successful lawyer, so I wanted to be like him, this made me study law at the university. He indirectly influenced me to study Law. As a young boy growing up, there was this tendency to be like him. But along the line, I realised I was destined to be a designer, but that didn\u2019t make me drop out of school. I completed my law programme before pursuing my passion for fashion. I came to Lagos for my Law school programme, after which, I stayed behind to establish the Vanskere brand. A few years later, I felt the need to have a formal education in fashion, so I went to London to study at the London College of fashion.\n\nDescribe a day in the life of Evans Akere\n\nI start my day with prayers, then go to the gym if its my workout day. I go back home to freshen up and have breakfast, after which I get to work. I work long hours so I get home quite late. I usually look forward to going home to my family after a long day at work. My routine is quite seamless \u2013 I wind down by watching some news channels. If I am inspired, I create new designs, if not, it lights out.\n\nMen do not always pay attention to the way they dress. Give some advice on how to be stylish?\n\nMy advice will be to wear clothes that fit. Men should not shy away from bright colours, the era of wearing only dull colours is long gone. Dress for the occasion and keep accessories to a minimum.\n\nWhat are some of your biggest dreams that you are yet to fulfill?\n\nThat would be making Vanskere a complete African fashion and lifestyle brand.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside work?\n\nI am a huge football fan, I enjoy watching and analyzing the game. I like listening to music. I also like to watch good movies and read books.\n\nWhat is next for Vanskere?\n\nThe next phase is to make the brand more accessible worldwide.\n\nAre you looking to design for ladies in the future?\n\nSure, it is something we are looking into.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you take time out to relax?\n\nI stay indoors and watch good movies and work out. I am what some would term an \u201cintrovert\u201d, but I cherish my time out with my family. I work really hard, so I don\u2019t joke with family vacations. I take out time every year to go on holiday.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nThat would be Dubai. It\u2019s an ideal holiday destination, with luxury hotels, theme parks, and loads of activities.\n\nNigeria will be celebrating her independence anniversary soon, with all that is going on, do you think there\u2019s a reason to celebrate?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is any reason to celebrate, but we have every reason to be grateful. At least, we are not experiencing a civil war, despite the challenges. Nigeria is still better than Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a country where you\u2019re free to be the very best and productive that you can be, irrespective of your tribe and religion. A country where hard work is rewarded and people do not steal from each other to get rich. Lastly, a prosperous nation where every Nigerian will live in dignity.",

Nigeria is still better than Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a country where you\u2019re free to be the very best and productive that you can be, irrespective of your tribe and religion. A country where hard work is rewarded and people do not steal from each other to get rich. Lastly, a prosperous nation where every Nigerian will live in dignity.",

          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nAs Nigeria gets set to celebrate her 61st independence anniversary on Thursday, 1st October, Nigeria\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Diaspora Comission (NIDCOM), Hon Abike Dabiri Erewa in this exclusive interview, speaks on some salient issues currently plaguing the country.\n\nThe former House of Representatives Member, who was one of the most vocal voices, especially on the issues of women and children, also opens up on the place of women in politics today, her role and challenges as head of NIDCOM, the issue of migration and of course, the Nigeria of her dreams.\n\nNigeria will on October 1, turn 61 as a nation. At a time like this, do you think there is anything or reason to celebrate?\n\nOf course, there is every reason to celebrate; that we are alive today, that we have a country, and I tell you, it is a country to be proud of. There are challenges no doubt, but we must look at our strengths, rather than our weaknesses. We should look at what unites us rather than what separates us. So, yes, Nigeria is not where it should be at 61, but gradually, we will get there. But it\u2019s not about government alone, it is about every one of us, at home and in the diaspora, working together to build this great country of ours.\n\nMany Nigerians who trusted your party the APC to bring about change and move them to the next level have had their hopes dashed, with many opting to migrate to other countries. How can hope be rekindled again?\n\nI don\u2019t know what you mean by the situation in Nigeria, what we encourage is, you can migrate. You can\u2019t stop migration, legal or illegal. But, try to avoid irregular migration. And also, when you are in another man\u2019s country, it is important that you try to obey the laws of that country. In the UAE for instance, we are bombarded every day with complaints that UAE is not renewing work permits. But we went to see the UAE Ambassador, and he made it clear that there is no official policy from the UAE government about not renewing work permits. But Nigerians are still being denied work permits. In this situation for instance, it\u2019s a case of the bad now affecting the good.\n\nWhen you are in another man\u2019s country and you go to rob a bank in broad daylight in a place like UAE, I condemned it and I listed the names of the four Nigerians who committed the crime. I was criticized for mentioning their names. People felt it was because they were from a particular section of the country, but when you are out there, you are seen as Nigerian first before any tribe.\n\nThis is a country with laws and zero tolerance for crime. Now those guys are serving life imprisonment. In the same UAE, our brothers took cultism there, and they were killing themselves openly. We have seen a lot of things happen and now the bad is affecting the good.\n\nSo what I am telling Nigerians in UAE that are being affected now is, you go out there condemn bad behaviour. Let it be known that those few do not represent who we are as a people. But when you sit down there and you don\u2019t call out those who do these things, then, the bad will definitely affect the good. But I am hoping that the issue of the UAE can be dealt with at the ministerial level, not at my level. However, UAE has said that there is no official policy on the issue.\n\nIn UAE and in other countries, no Nigerian will be allowed to be treated anyhow as instructed by Mr. President and we\u2019ve had a lot of interventions.\n\nBut NIDCOM does not deal with consular issues, it is basically the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that deals with consular issues. So, in terms of being treated anyhow, once you don\u2019t commit a crime, we will intervene. But you cannot commit a crime, or break the laws and expect that we are going to beg for you.\n\nThe economic situation in Nigeria has made Nigerians endure indignities in different countries across the globe. How easy or difficult has this home situation made your work as head of NIDCOM?\n\nThis question is general. I\u2019ll take specific cases. In South Africa with the issue of xenophobia, Mr. President intervened himself, it was dealt with.\n\nWe dealt with the issue of Traders in Ghana and the President also sent a delegation.\n\nThe issue of Libya, and Nigerians languishing in Libyan detention centers for years, Mr President set up a committee headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to go into detention camps in Libya. We brought thousands of Nigerians back. But guess what, despite all that, people are still going. We need massive awareness campaign. In Lebanon for instance, we brought stranded Nigerians back and one of the girls said to me \u201cI will rather be selling guguru (popcorn) under the bridge than go back there.\u201d\n\nSo, I think if people know that where they are running to is worse than where they are running from, they will have a rethink.\n\nWhat can be done to stem the rise of abuse of Nigerians by their host country?\n\nAny Nigerian, if you are unjustly abused, we will definitely intervene. We have intervened on many occasions. We will not allow you to suffer for a crime you didn\u2019t commit, period. We work with the missions to ensure that no Nigerian is treated unjustly and we also reject stereotyping of Nigerians. If A commits a crime deal with it, don\u2019t say because A committed a crime, you punish B for that because he is a Nigerian. That is not going to happen. We as Nigerians must reject that stereotype.\n\nBut, please, if you don\u2019t obey laws in your own country, you can\u2019t go to another man\u2019s country and disobey. It is as simple as that, but we have definitely been intervening in cases where Nigerians have been affected. Many of them are not even in the media. When we get complaints, we work directly with the missions and a whole lot of times, we get results.\n\nNigeria hasn\u2019t been this divided since Independence, and fingers point at what is generally regarded as poor leadership at the center. What do you make of it?\n\nLeadership has its own role, followership also has its own role. So, let\u2019s look at it holistically. I think as a people, what are our values? What are our morals? What are the things that matter to us? So, I look at it holistically, yes, leadership is a problem, but so is followership. There has to be better participatory democracy, and for the elites in particular who sit back and say \u201coh, I won\u2019t get involved,\u201d to know it is wrong. It is also important for the citizens to demand the best of their leaders.\n\nDo you share the growing notion that Nigeria may cease to exist if current multifaceted problems are not addressed urgently?\n\nI hope not because, Nigeria will emerge strong, but it has to be a united Nigeria, where merit counts, where it doesn\u2019t matter who you know or where you come from and one that will expose the best of your potentials.\n\nI believe that the kind of democracy, or system of government we are practicing now is not meant for us, but we are in it. What do we do to make it better? There has to be devolution of powers to the local and state levels. The strongest arm of government should be the local level. What would the federal government be doing with education in a local community like Imota for instance? I believe in devolution of power. Let powers devolve to the local level, and at that stage, you can have the very strongest in the community head the local government. I mean that is what federalism should be about. The kind of system we are operating now is not working for us, and will not not work for us until we take certain measures and that rests with the National Assembly. The National Assembly needs to look at both the exclusive and concurrent list in the constitution and review them such that more powers go to the local government. If you have a strong local government that is empowered and funded, we will solve a lot of problems.\n\nWhat would you say are the challenges you face as head of NIDCOM and how do you overcome them?\n\nThe greatest challenge is funding, you know it is a new agency, but we don\u2019t let that stop us. We are trying to work on gathering data but Nigerians abroad don\u2019t want to share their data. But we are working at building trust and confidence of Nigerians abroad knowing that it helps in planning.\n\nWhat do you think are some of the ways to help a country like Nigeria help itself, and relieve some of the pressures for emigration?\n\nMr. President is concentrating a lot on infrastructural development, creating the kind of environment where jobs can be created. This is what government is doing under the office of the Vice President, to encourage small businesses and startups. Although not everybody is looking for a job, because from the experience I have had, even if you have the jobs, there are some people who just believe that their destiny is abroad. Why would somebody that has three trailers, sell them for about 10 million naira, decides that he wants to relocate to Europe, gets stuck in Libya and then, comes back with nothing? We need a lot of awareness. It is not rosy out there. Go to the streets of Greece and see Africans including Nigerians, just roaming about; no jobs, they can\u2019t even speak the language and then, they are hawking and not selling anything. Like the lady from Lebanon said, she is better off selling guguru (popcorn) somewhere.\n\nUnfortunately, the kind of education that we are providing is not making graduates startup on their own. So, the government has a role to play, but we also have our own roles to play too in letting that young person know not to fall victim of traffickers. So, a lot has to be done by government and us, but you can\u2019t stop migration. If I am below 30 and I find opportunities abroad, of course, I am going to go.\n\nSince your time at the National Assembly, female legislators have not been very vocal. What is happening with the women?\n\nI don\u2019t think women in the parliament are less vocal. There is a bill in place now to create over 100 seats dedicated to women and I think it was sponsored by Hon. Nkiruka. So I don\u2019t think women are less vocal, they are less in number. When I was in parliament, we were 27; but now, I think they are just half the number both in the House and the Senate. Also, there are less women in political space in terms of leadership. We need to work at making it better.\n\nHow far would you say women have come in terms of politics, since independence?\n\nWe can do better and beyond tokenism which is what the two major parties- APC and PDP are doing now. You know there is no level- playing field, so, I encourage women, If you want a change, you need to leave your comfort zone and be part of politics. I don\u2019t mean you have to contest elections, just let your voices be heard. I started at the local level, attending ward meetings, before I decided to contest elections. If you know it is in you, you need to venture out to succeed.\n\nHowever, there are some cultural issues that still make it difficult for women in politics. But we can\u2019t give up, more women need to participat. So, join a political party, be a leader in your community, go to your ward level, get to know the grassroots, mingle with them, and get to know what is going on. The more women you have in the system, no matter what anybody says, when you give them a task, they deliver.\n\nYou are obviously a very busy woman when you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nI like to be home and to spend time with my family. I love music so I like to sing and dance. Music relaxes me and I try to exercise but a lot of times, you get to lazy to do it. But yes, home is my comfort zone and music relaxes me.\n\nWhen it comes to fashion does your office determine your style? What are you more comfortable in?\n\nThe occasion determines what I wear. I wear what suits me, but of course you know I love Nigerian attires. I remember a lot of times when I travelled, I always bought skirts, suits and trousers; not anymore. Maybe one or two for some occasions. I do love,our Nigerian outfits, and a whole lot of times that I travel, sometimes, I don\u2019t come back with them because somebody likes them and has to take them.\n\nSo, I wear what I feel comfortable in. I believe you can be simple and elegant.\n\nAre you looking at contesting for any political position sometime soon?\n\nWell, right now, I am chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and it has been very challenging setting up a new commission and dealing with millions of Nigerians all over the world. I think my key thing now is just to succeed on the job and set a solid structure on the ground. The future will take care of itself.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dream?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a strong united Nigeria; a Nigeria where it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, who you know, where merit will be our watchword, where you progress because you are good and where your potentials will not be buried. I dream of a free, fair, equitable Nigeria, a Nigeria where poverty will be absolutely and totally reduced, a Nigeria where everybody can live comfortably, where the rich will not be getting richer and the poor getting poorer and a Nigeria where corruption will be totally gone.\n\nOne of our major problems is corruption and corruption is from top to bottom. We just have to tackle that cankerworm called corruption. Having a corrupt-free Nigeria is the only way we can make progress.\n\nAnd then, civil service reforms are quite important; otherwise, the business of government will be difficult.",

          "title": "Mmekidmfon Umanah\u2026Building a healthcare bridge between Europe and West Africa",
          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nWith Africa\u2019s healthcare system on the brink of collapse, Nigerian born UK based Mmekidmfon Umanah, is on a mission to strengthen the West African frontline and primary healthcare system via his project company; Aimcare Health Limited a product sourcing company that is building the healthcare bridge between Europe and West Africa by connecting European health startups to the unique market opportunities in West Africa.\n\nA Chevening alumnus with an MSc in International Development from the University of Birmingham, with an incoming PhD in Business and Management candidate at the King\u2019s College London, Mmekidmfon also serves as the Executive Director of WaterEase Organization, a nonprofit using resource mobilisation and advocacy to help underserved communities have better access to clean water in Nigeria.\n\nSo far, through his advocacy work, four communities in have been provided with clean water, with a community in Bauchi as the latest beneficiary.\n\nMmekidmfon shares his motivating factor and overall mission for his work.\n\nWhat is the motive behind the creation of Aimcare? What inspired it?\n\nThe truth is that the African healthcare system is simply broken, and this cost me my mother\u2019s life in 2013. For 80% of people in Africa, their community pharmacy and patent medicine stores are the frontlines of their health system and, yet they routinely stock out of essential medicines, incur significant losses to expiry, and struggle with substandard and falsified drugs and medical consumables. Where immunizations, contraceptives, anti-infectives, essential devices, and diagnostics, or chronic-care at the local clinic or pharmacy are expired, too expensive, or simply unavailable, providers, patients, and whole communities pay the price; we are currently working to prevent these. . Hence, I am committed to tackling this issue through Aimcare, working our way up from just inventory access and financing to infrastructure financing.\n\nWe are ensuring that consumers have access to the best and most innovative products in the market regardless of their location or economic status.\n\nAnd how do you go about achieving your goal?\n\nAimcare Health Limited\u2019s mission is to strengthen the West African frontline and primary healthcare system by providing pharmacies, primary healthcare centres, patent medicine stores and hospitals with the most innovative, user-friendly, and affordable products in the global market. We are currently doing this by connecting global health start-ups to unique and high-potential opportunities on the African continent. We focus on non-clich\u00e9 opportunities in the healthcare ecosystem from piloting disruptive technology to marketing innovative consumer products and wearables. By leveraging on our unique partnership channels, we have built access to 1000 pharmacies, 200 patient medicine stores and 50 clinics.\n\nDot Glasses is one of the foreign start-ups we are working with. We are their sole partners in Nigeria and we are enabling the facilities as listed above to get access to this affordable yet quality vision care solution.\n\nHow is Aimcare financed?\n\nAimcare is a for-profit startup and primarily we make money from our services. For a while, people used to erroneously think we are a non-profit, and possibly this came from the fact that we are involved with a lot of impact projects. For instance, we have a project that involves distributing birth kits to pregnant women in rural communities through the traditional birth attendant homes and distributing hygiene kits to boarding secondary schools. The reality though is that these projects are now part of our non-profit vehicle\u2019s (Waterease) value proposition and no more Aimcare directly.\n\nAt what point did the Dot Glasses project come in and what informed it?\n\nAimcare currently has an exclusive partnership with a Czech based company called DOT Glasses, tell us about it?\n\nDOT Glasses is a Czech-based vision Care Company that has developed proprietary on-spot testing that allows us to test, diagnose and provide our customised prescription lenses on the spot all in less than 4 minutes for a total cost of $4. DOT Glasses is the first sustainable solution to the world\u2019s vision problem. With their patented, snap-together, adjustable frames designed by a subsidiary of Mercedes Benz; Impact and scratch-resistant lenses; simple proprietary vision testing tools; and extraordinarily robust 100% injection-molded ABS plastic, they ensure the end-user has access to quality prescription lenses at an ultra-affordable rate.\n\nTell us your achievement with DOT glasses project in Nigeria?\n\nFrom inception to-date we have sold about six thousand five-hundred DOT glasses and partnered with some non-commercial partners like Akwa Ibom State government and the Ini Ememobong Foundation to distribute 500 for free. We have in the process provided eye tests for one thousand people. We\u2019ve partnered with the government and private companies to distribute 7000 pairs of these glasses since March this year\n\nFrom all you have done, your projects seem to focus more on the northern part of Nigeria, why is that so and when are you extending to other parts of the country?\n\nWe do have some presence in the North. We have partners in Kebbi, Zaria and Abuja. Also, A few months ago, Aimcare\u2019s non-profit vehicle; Waterease Organisation, provided clean water to the good people of Dasham Community in Bauchi State by building them a borehole. That project will provide water to 700 people in and around that community. However, our biggest business comes from Lagos. Most of our commercial partners are in Lagos.\n\nWhat is your future projection for Aimcare?\n\nAs far as future projections go, our midterm goal is to disrupt the industry by helping primary healthcare facilities avoid stock outs and have uninterrupted access to inventory. We want to be able to improve access to medicines and medical products by providing innovative financing and inventory management solutions to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.\n\nOur long term goal is to be able to facilitate healthcare investment to the continent by financing infrastructure.\n\nYou are gradually bridging the gap in the healthcare sector, using Aimcare in providing opportunities, what have been the challenges you have encountered so far?\n\nThe challenges we are facing are perhaps not significantly different from the challenges many businesses in Nigeria are facing. For instance, our business is very reliant on FX and a few months ago we were doing business at N400 to $1. Currently we are doing business at N510 to $1. This makes things very difficult especially for companies like us aiming to ensure the prices of our products are super affordable.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and what events shaped you into the person you are today?\n\nGrowing was fun. We did not have a lot, but my parents ensured I got the best education I could possibly have gotten. I attended private schools at both nursery and primary and secondary school levels. I remember that my secondary school was quite pricey at the time, and it makes me wonder how my parents were able to afford, as I look back in retrospect.\n\nI generally had a slow start in life; I could not read a timepiece until I was about 10, 11 years old. But as an only child, my mother\u2019s support was relentless. She used to call me Doctor and always wanted me to be a Doctor. I hope as she looks down from heaven, she is proud that I am on my way to getting a Doctorate and I\u2019ll truly be called a Doctor even though it is not medical. But even importantly, I hope she is even more proud that I am running a successful healthcare start-up that is tackling some of the things that cost her life.",

We\u2019re already working, there\u2019s nothing.\n\n\u201cEven to contemplate a state of emergency is unfortunate, look at what is happening in the north; they kill dozens every day. Because less than 15 people were killed in Anambra in two weeks, is that a reason for somebody to call for a state of emergency?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very unfortunate comment by Malami. I will call him to express reservation on those kinds of comments, he shouldn\u2019t try that,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor said he also used the opportunity of his visit to Abuja to brief and solicit support from some security agencies towards addressing security challenges in Anambra.\n\n\u201cWe are getting more boots on ground, we\u2019re getting more equipment and I believe in less than two weeks all these things will be over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll overwhelm and conquer all these miscreants that came from other states nearby to come and harass Anambra people.\n\n\u201cLet me stop at saying that they are from neighbouring states,\u2019\u2019 NAN quoted him as saying.",

The people have lost confidence in them and just as their imaginary Ebubeagu security outfit, no such faceless group can survive in South East. But we want to remind South East governors and the Igbo political elite that they represent less than one per cent of the Biafran population. The rest of over 99 per cent of the people earnestly ask for Biafra, and the train has long left the station.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the South East governors are the ones contemplating to create anarchy in the region. Now we can see the real sponsors of the festering insecurity in the region. We are watching them. Now it is obvious that South-East governors in collaboration with the wicked Nigeria security agents are behind the fake groups wrecking havoc across South East in their desperation to implicate IPOB.\n\n\u201cInstead of setting up a sincere regional security outfit like Amotekun, they created the mischievous and imaginary Ebubeagu to do the hatchet job for them. All this is in their futile efforts to demonise IPOB and ultimately scuttle the growing agitation for Biafra restoration which they consider injurious to their political interests,\u201d Powerful said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The day you had your final dose does not count as one of the 14 days. You must be able to prove that you have been fully vaccinated under a vaccination programme and have a valid proof of vaccination recognised by the British Government (for Nigeria, the certificates with valid QR codes as issued by Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency are recognised).\n\nThe British High Commission added: \u201cIf you are not a fully vaccinated traveller from Nigeria to England, you must: take a pre-departure COVID-19 test \u2013 to be taken in the three days before travel; book and pay for day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 tests \u2013 to be taken after arrival; complete a passenger locator form \u2013 any time in the 48 hours before arrival.\u201d\n\nThe British High Commission also said: \u201cAfter you arrive, you must: quarantine at home or in the place you are staying for 10 days, take a pre-booked COVID-19 test on or before day 2 and on or after day eight.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, Acting British High Commissioner, Ben Llewellyn-Jones, said: \u201cThe exemption of fully-vaccinated Nigerians travelling to the UK from providing a pre-departure test and self-isolating for 10 days, is a very welcome development.\u201d\n\nTo make this happen, we have been working closely with Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency on recognising Nigeria\u2019s vaccine certification, which we have now done.\n\n\u201cThe UK remains committed to opening up international travel and enabling those who wish to enter the UK, to do so safely.\n\n\u201cVaccines work and \u2013 as the pandemic has shown \u2013 no one is safe until we are all safe.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Obinna Odogwu, Awka and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, threatened to invoke a state of emergency in Anambra State to ensure the sanctity of the November 6 governorship election.\n\nAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, dropped the hint when he briefed correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) at the presidential villa, Abuja.\n\nThe meeting was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nStakeholders in the Anambra election, including the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have raised the alarm over the upsurge in violent attacks on individuals and government facilities in Anambra as the governorship election in the state draws closer.\n\nMeanehile, angry reactions have trailed the state of emergency threat of the Federal Government.\n\nMalami, however, said the Federal Government had the responsibility to sustain democratic order and would not hesitate to declare a state of emergency if the security situation in the state did not improve to allow peaceful conduct of election.\n\n\u201cWhen our national security is attacked, and the sanctity of our constitutionally guaranteed democracy is threatened, no possibility is ruled out. As a government, we have a responsibility to ensure the sustenance of our democratic order, we have a responsibility to provide security to life and properties. So, within the context of these constitutional obligations of the government or the desire to establish democratic norms and order, there is no possibility that is out ruled.\n\n\u201cAnd you cannot rule out possibilities, inclusive of possibility of declaration of state of emergency where it is established that there is a failure on the part of the state government to ensure the sanctity of security of lives, properties and democratic order. So, our position as a government is that this elections are going to hold. And necessary security in terms of democratic order must certainly prevail for the purpose of this election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe AGF assured that the government would do the needful in providing security for lives and properties in Anambra.\n\nWhen asked whether the positions his office expressed on both the open grazing laws by states and on the Value Added Tax (VAT) would not influence the course of justice since the matters were in court.\n\nHe replied: \u201cWell, on the issue of farmers/ herders clashes, no position was taken by the Office of the Attorney General outside the scope of the constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cThe position of the Office of the Attorney General is about freedom and liberty of movement among others\u2026And what the Office of the Attorney General has simply succeeded in doing is making a reference to relevant constitutional provisions and established a position that each and every Nigerian is entitled to freedom of movement. Simpliciter. So, the issue is whether that freedom of movement is constitutionally guaranteed or not. And my answer to it is the freedom of movement is indeed, constitutionally guaranteed.\u201d\n\nOn governors push for states to collect VAT, he said the Federal Government was contemplating heading straight to the Supreme Court, which according to him, has jurisdiction over such matters.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal has granted an order of stay of execution, directing these state governments (Rivers and Lagos) to maintain status quo pending the determination of the main appeal and these matters are being considered for determination.\n\n\u201cAnd some other governors have filed in an application for joinder, seeking to be joined in the matter as interested parties. But again, there is pending, equally, an application and preliminary objection for that matter, challenging the competence of the action and indeed the judgement that was obtained. But the Federal Government is still looking at other possibilities, all options open in terms of challenging the action, the action of the state government.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "For the Record: Buhari\u2019s 2022 Budget Speech",
          "text": "Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\n\nBy Muhammadu Buhari\n\n1. It is my great pleasure to be here once again to present the 2022 Federal Budget Proposals to this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly.\n\n2. Distinguished and Honourable leaders, and members of the National Assembly, let me start by commending you for the expeditious consideration and passage of the Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2021. This further underscores your commitment to our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic and address the various security challenges facing our country.\n\n3. I will also take this opportunity to thank you for the quick consideration and approval of the 2022-2024 Medium-term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper. Our hope is that National Assembly will continue to partner with the Executive by ensuring that deliberations on the 2022 Budget are completed before the end of this year so that the Appropriation Act can come into effect by the first of January 2022.\n\n4. The 2022 Budget will be the last full year budget to be implemented by this administration. We designed it to build on the achievements of previous budgets and to deliver on our goals and aspirations as will be reflected in our soon-to-be launched National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025.\n\n5. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, in normal times, I make use of this opportunity to provide an overview of global and domestic developments in the current year, a summary of our achievements, and our plans for the next fiscal year.\n\n6. However, these are exceptional times. The grim realities of COVID-19 and its lethal variants are still upon us. From President to Pauper, the virus does not discriminate.\n\n7. This is why our country still maintains its COVID -19 guidelines and protocols in place to protect its citizens and stop the spread of this disease.\n\n8. Over the past few days, we have consulted with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the leadership of the National Assembly on how best to present the 2022 budget proposal keeping in mind the deep-rooted traditions in place and the guidelines for safe mass gatherings.\n\n9. We ultimately decided that the most responsible and respectful approach was to hold a shorter than usual gathering while allowing the Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to provide fuller details of our proposals in a smaller event.\n\n10. I am sure many of you will be relieved as my last budget speech in October 2020 lasted over fifty minutes.\n\n11. Still, over the next few minutes, I will provide key highlights of our 2021 performance as well as our proposals for 2022.\n\nPERFORMANCE OF THE 2021 BUDGET\n\n12. The 2021 \u2018Budget of Economic Recovery and Resilience\u2019 is based on a benchmark oil price of 40 US Dollars per barrel, oil production of 1.6m b/d, and exchange rate of 379 Naira to US Dollar. Furthermore, a Supplementary budget of 982.73 billion Naira was recently enacted to address exigent issues in the Security and Health sectors.\n\n13. Based on the 2021 Fiscal Framework, total revenue of 8.12 trillion Naira was projected to fund aggregate federal expenditure of 14.57 trillion Naira (inclusive of the supplementary budget). The projected fiscal deficit of 6.45 trillion Naira, or 4.52 percent of GDP, is expected to be financed mainly by domestic and external borrowings.\n\n14. By July 2021, Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production averaged one 1.70million barrels (inclusive of condensates) and the market price of Bonny Light crude averaged 68.53 US Dollars per barrel.\n\n15. Accordingly, actual revenues were 34 percent below target as of July 2021, mainly due to the underperformance of oil and gas revenue sources. Federal Government\u2019s retained revenues (excluding Government Owned Enterprises) amounted to 2.61 trillion Naira against the proportionate target of 3.95 trillion Naira for the period.\n\n16. The Federal Government\u2019s share of Oil revenue totalled 570.23 billion Naira as of July 2021, which was 51 percent below target, while non-oil tax revenues totalled 964.13 billion Naira. The poor performance of oil revenue relative to the budget was largely due to the shortfall in production as well as significant cost recovery by NNPC to cover the shortfall between its cost of importing petrol and the pump price.\n\n17. The National Assembly will recall that in March 2020 the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency announced that the price of petrol would henceforth be determined by market forces.\n\n18. However, as the combination of rising crude oil prices and exchange rate combined to push the price above the hitherto regulated price of 145 Naira per litre, opposition against the policy of price deregulation hardened on the part of Labour Unions in particular.\n\n19. Government had to suspend further upward price adjustments while engaging Labour on the subject. This petrol subsidy significantly eroded revenues that should have been available to fund the budget.\n\n20. On a positive note, we surpassed the non-oil taxes target by eleven (11) percent in aggregate. The sustained improvement in non-oil taxes indicates that some of our revenue reforms are yielding positive results. We expect further improvement in revenue collections later in the year as more corporate entities file their tax returns and we accelerate the implementation of our revenue reforms.\n\nImproving Revenue Generation and Administration\n\n21. We have stepped up implementation of the strengthened framework for performance management of government owned enterprises (GOEs), with a view to improve their operational efficiencies, revenue generation and accountability. The 50% cost-to-income ratio imposed on the GOEs in the Finance Act 2020 has contributed significantly to rationalizing wasteful expenditures by several GOEs and enhanced the level of operating surpluses to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). I solicit the cooperation of the National Assembly in enforcing the cost-to-income ratio and other prudential guidelines during your consideration of the budget proposals of the GOEs, which I am also laying before you today.\n\n22. On the expenditure side, as at end of July 2021, a total of six point seven-nine (6.79) trillion Naira had been spent as against the pro-rated expenditure of seven point nine-one (7.91) trillion Naira. Accordingly, a deficit of four point one-seven (4.17) trillion Naira was recorded as at end of July 2021. The deficit was financed through domestic borrowing.\n\n23. Despite our revenue challenges, we have consistently met our debt service commitments. We are also up to date on the payment of staff salaries, statutory transfers, and overhead costs. As at (4th of October 2021, a total of 1.732 trillion Naira had been released for capital expenditure.\n\n24. I am pleased to inform you that we expect to fund MDAs\u2019 capital budget fully by the end of the fiscal year 2021.\n\n25. Capital releases thus far have been prioritised in favour of critical ongoing infrastructural projects in the power, roads, rail, agriculture, health and education sectors.\n\n26. We have made progress on the railway projects connecting different parts of the country. I am glad to report that the Lagos-Ibadan Line is now completed and operational. The Abuja-Kaduna Line is running efficiently. The Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail Line was finally completed and commissioned over thirty (30) years after its initiation.\n\n27. Arrangements are underway to complete the Ibadan-Kano Line. Also, work will soon commence on the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri Line and Calabar-Lagos Coastal Line, which will connect the Southern and Eastern States to themselves and to the North.\n\n28. Progress is also being made on several power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, as well as off-grid solutions, all aimed towards achieving the national goal of optimizing power supply by 2025.\n\n29. I am again happy to report that we continue to make visible progress in our strategic road construction projects like the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan expressway, Apapa \u2013 Oworonsoki expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano expressway, East-West Road and the second Niger bridge. We hope to commission most of these projects before the end of our tenure in 2023.\n\n30. The Pandemic revealed the urgent need to strengthen our health system. Towards this end, we constructed 52 Molecular labs, 520 bed intensive care units, 52 Isolation centres and provision of Personal Protective equipment across 52 Federal Medical Centres and Teaching Hospitals.\n\n31. We continue to push our expenditure rationalization initiatives which we commenced in 2016. For example, on personnel costs, the number of MDAs captured on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System increased from 459 in 2017 to 711 to date.\n\n32. The recent passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, and consequent incorporation of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation should also result in rationalisation of expenditure, as well as increased investments and improved output in the oil and gas industry.\n\n33. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, you will agree with me that a lot has been accomplished over the last year but there is still much to be done. I will now proceed with a review of the 2022 Budget proposal.\n\nTHEME AND PRIORITIES OF THE 2022 BUDGET\n\n34. The allocations to MDAs were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025, which are:\n\na. Diversifying the economy, with robust MSME growth;\n\nb. Investing in critical infrastructure;\n\nc. Strengthening security and ensuring good governance;\n\nd. Enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace;\n\ne. Reducing poverty; and\n\nf. Minimizing regional, economic and social disparities.\n\n35. The 2022 Appropriation therefore is a Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability.\n\n36. Defence and internal security will continue to be our top priority. We remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\n\n37. The 2022 budget is also the first in our history, where MDAs were clearly advised on gender responsive budgeting. These are part of critical steps in our efforts to distribute resources fairly and reach vulnerable groups of our society.\n\nPARAMETERS AND FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS\n\n38. Distinguished Members of the National Assembly, the 2022 to 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper sets out the parameters for the 2022 Budget as follows:\n\na. Conservative oil price benchmark of 57 US Dollars per barrel;\n\nb. Daily oil production estimate of 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day);\n\nc. Exchange rate of four 410.15 per US Dollar; and\n\nd. Projected GDP growth rate of 4.2 percent and 13 percent inflation rate.\n\n2022 REVENUE ESTIMATES\n\n39. Based on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally-collectible revenue is estimated at 17.70 trillion Naira in 2022.\n\n40. Total federally distributable revenue is estimated at 12.72 trillion Naira in 2022 while total revenue available to fund the 2022 Federal Budget is estimated at 10.13 trillion Naira. This includes Grants and Aid of 63.38 billion Naira, as well as the revenues of 63 Government-Owned Enterprises.\n\n41. Oil revenue is projected at 3.16 trillion, Non-oil taxes are estimated at 2.13 trillion Naira and FGN Independent revenues are projected to be 1.82 trillion Naira.\n\nPLANNED 2022 EXPENDITURE\n\n42. A total expenditure of sixteen point three-nine (16.39) trillion Naira is proposed for the Federal Government in 2022. The proposed expenditure comprises:\n\na. Statutory Transfers of 768.28 billion Naira;\n\nb. Non-debt Recurrent Costs of 6.83 trillion;\n\nc. Personnel Costs of 4.11 trillion Naira;\n\nd. Pensions, Gratuities and Retirees\u2019 Benefits 577.0 billion Naira;\n\ne. Overheads of 792.39 billion Naira;\n\nf. Capital Expenditure of 5.35 trillion Naira, including the capital component of Statutory Transfers;\n\ng. Debt Service of 3.61 trillion Naira; and\n\nh. Sinking Fund of 292.71 billion Naira to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nFiscal Balance\n\n43. We expect the total fiscal operations of the Federal Government to result in a deficit of 6.26 trillion Naira. This represents 3.39 percent of estimated GDP, slightly above the 3 percent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. Countries around the world have to of necessity over-shoot their fiscal thresholds for the economies to survive and thrive\n\n44. We need to exceed this threshold considering our collective desire to continue tackling the existential security challenges facing our country.\n\n45. We plan to finance the deficit mainly by new borrowings totalling 5.01 trillion Naira, 90.73 billion Naira from Privatization Proceeds and 1.16 trillion Naira drawdowns on loans secured for specific development projects.\n\n46. Some have expressed concern over our resort to borrowing to finance our fiscal gaps. They are right to be concerned. However, we believe that the debt level of the Federal Government is still within sustainable limits. Borrowings are to specific strategic projects and can be verified publicly.\n\n47. As you are aware, we have witnessed two economic recessions within the period of this Administration. In both cases, we had to spend our way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt.\n\n48. Our target over the medium term is to grow our Revenue-to-GDP ratio from about 8 percent currently to 15 percent by 2025. At that level of revenues, the Debt-Service-to-Revenue ratio will cease to be worrying. Put simply, we do not have a debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge which we are determined to tackle to ensure our debts remain sustainable.\n\n49. Very importantly, we have endeavoured to use the loans to finance critical development projects and programmes aimed at improving our economic environment and ensuring effective delivery of public services to our people. We focused on;\n\na. the completion of major road and rail projects;\n\nb. the effective implementation of Power sector projects;\n\nc. the provision of potable water;\n\nd. construction of irrigation infrastructure and dams across the country; and\n\ne. critical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading Primary Health Care Centres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nInnovations in Infrastructure Financing\n\n50. In 2022, Government will further strengthen the frameworks for concessions and public private partnerships (PPPs). Capital projects that are good candidates for PPP by their nature will be developed for private sector participation.\n\n51. We will also explore available opportunities in the existing ecosystem of green finance including the implementation of our Sovereign Green Bond Programme and leveraging debt-for-climate swap mechanisms.\n\nEnhancing Revenue Mobilisation\n\n52. Our strategies to improve revenue mobilisation will be sustained in 2022 with the goal of achieving the following objectives:\n\na. Enhance tax and excise revenues through policy reforms and tax administration measures;\n\nb. Review the policy effectiveness of tax waivers and concessions;\n\nc. Boost customs revenue through the e-Customs and Single Window initiatives; and\n\nd. Safeguard revenues from the oil and gas sector.\n\n53. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, I commend you for the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021. It is my hope that the implementation of the law will boost confidence in our economy and attract substantial investments in the sector.\n\nFinance Bill 2022\n\n54. In line with our plan to accompany annual budgets with Finance Bills, partly to support the realization of fiscal projections, current tax and fiscal laws are being reviewed to produce a draft Finance Bill 2022.\n\n55. It is our intention that once ongoing consultations are completed, the Finance Bill would be submitted to the National Assembly to be considered alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n56. Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Distinguished and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, this speech would be incomplete without commending the immense, patriotic, and collaborative support of the National Assembly in the effort to deliver socio-economic development and democracy dividends for our people.\n\n57. I wish to assure you of the strong commitment of the Executive to strengthen the relationship with the National Assembly.\n\n58. Nigeria is currently emerging from a very difficult economic challenge. We must continue to cooperate and ensure that our actions are aimed at accelerating the pace of economic recovery so that we can achieve economic prosperity and deliver on our promises to the Nigerian people.\n\n59. The fiscal year 2022 is very crucial in our efforts to ensure that critical projects are completed, put to use and improve the general living conditions of our people.\n\n60.

          "text": "Investigation has revealed that the London mansion where the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari on August 12, 2021 is the subject of a multi-billion fraud scandal.\n\nThe investigation is part of the global International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)-led Pandora Papers project, which Nigeria\u2019s PREMIUM TIMES is a part of.\n\nThe project involved 600 journalists from 150 news organisations around the world sorting and analysing a trove of almost 12 million confidential files, tracking down and interviewing sources, and adding context using public records and documents.\n\nThe leaked files were retrieved from some offshore services firms around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore entities for clients, many of them influential politicians, businesspersons, and criminals seeking to conceal their financial dealings.\n\nThe investigation added that the Buhari government had also secured a freezing order on the property from a Federal High Court before the previous owner, who is now an international fugitive, sold it at a huge discount to an offshore company owned by the governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola, a known proxy and a relative of Tinubu.\n\nThe property, which is situated at 32 Grove End Road, in the wealthy Westminster neighbourhood of London, has become a sort of mecca to associates of Tinubu, and politicians of the ruling APC, after the former Lagos Governor started staying there to recuperate.\n\nApart from Buhari, other politicians who have visited Tinubu at the expanse 6,975 sq ft property are the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; a former governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun; Amosun\u2019s successor, Dapo Abiodun; the governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; the governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu; members of the Lagos State House of Assembly; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; a contingent from Kano State led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje; top Fuji musician; Wasiu Ayinde, among other dignitaries.\n\nDocuments obtained from the UK property register revealed that in July 2013, the property with title number 340992, was bought for \u00a311.95 million by Zavlil Holdings Ltd, a shell company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a notorious tax haven.\n\nFurther documents obtained by PREMIUM TIMES revealed that Zavlil Holdings Limited is owned by Kolawole Aluko, an international fugitive wanted by law enforcement agencies in Nigeria and the United States for money laundering.\n\nKola Aluko and his associate, Jide Omokore, were indicted in the U.S. and Nigeria for multi-million-dollar fraud and money laundering violations allegedly in collusion with a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke.\n\nIn 2016, the Nigerian Government filed a Mareva injunction at a Federal High Court in Lagos seeking to confiscate a list of properties belonging to Messrs Aluko and Omokore valued at $1.8 billion.\n\nA Mareva injunction is a Court order which freezes the assets of a defendant pending the outcome of a litigation.\n\nIn the suit against Messrs Omokore and Aluko, alongside their companies, Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Nigeria Limited and Atlantic Energy Brass Development Limited, the Nigerian Government asked the court to grant it seven orders to prevent the accused from disposing the assets. The government alleged they were acquired through fraudulent means.\n\nThe third prayer the government made to the court was to grant it an order restraining the accused \u201cfrom giving any instruction, demanding, accepting, receiving payments and/or transacting, transferring, mortgaging or howsoever dealing in any manner with assets of the Defendants in both houses and land in Abuja and Lagos and others located outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe government then listed 17 properties in Abuja, Lagos, the U.S., Canada, Dubai, Switzerland, and the UK. Among the listed properties was \u201cGrove End Road, London\u201d.\n\nThe court granted the government all its prayers. In October 2017, an attempt by the defendants to dismiss the Mareva injunction granted on the properties was subsequently dismissed by Oluremi Oguntoyinbo, the trial judge.\n\nBut just around the time (on October 18, 2017) the court dismissed the defendant\u2019s attempt to dismiss the injunction, documents obtained from the U.K. property register revealed that Mr Aluko sold the house for \u00a39 million to Aranda Overseas Corporation, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgins Island by two of Tinubu\u2019s most trusted surrogates \u2013 Adegboyega Oyetola, formerly chair of Paragon Group of Companies and incumbent governor of Osun State and Elusanmi Eludoyin, Mr Oyetola\u2019s successor at Paragon.\n\nIn November 1999, 18 years before it was used as a vehicle to purchase the London property, Oyetola and his billionaire partner, Eludoyin, sought the service of a Bristol, UK-based international company registration agent, Jordans Limited, to help them set up a company.\n\nThey wanted a kind of setup that would guarantee some secrecy and on November 11 of that year, the company was registered.\n\nLeaked confidential records revealed that Messrs Eludoyin and Oyetola became the shareholders and directors of Aranda and we did not see any record that the latter resigned from the management of the company even as he served as chief of staff to his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola, thereby breaking Nigeria\u2019s law.\n\nIn Nigeria, a person is statutorily obligated to withdraw from engaging in or directing a private business, except if it is farming, upon becoming a public officer, Section Six (6) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act stipulates.\n\nApart from Aranda, Oyetola has another footprint in the offshore shadow economy. He and Eludoyin, in 2003, incorporated another shelf company in the British Virgin Islands, Global Investments Offshore Limited.\n\nHe ran the company as a director almost throughout his term as Mr Aregbesola\u2019s Chief of Staff. However in June 2018, months before he became governor, he withdrew from the company and made his children \u2013 Rukayat Oyetola, Hafiz Oyetola, and Rasheedat Oyetola directors.\n\nHe also transferred his shares in Global Investments Offshore Limited to Mr Eludoyin and his son Haifz in June 2018. A register of directors we saw shows that all the formalities for the transfers were concluded and signed on June 1, 2018.\n\nBy remaining a director of Global Offshore for the entire period he was Chief of Staff to Aregbesola, Oyetola violated Nigeria\u2019s code of conduct law and could be arraigned before the Code of Conduct Tribunal if authorities decide to prosecute him for the infraction.\n\nIt however remains unclear why Oyetola would rush to buy a property his country was pushing to confiscate due to well-known corruption allegations against its then owner.\n\nAlso unclear is why Tinubu, who apparently wants to become Nigeria`s president, would agree to stay at the controversial property.\n\nAs for Buhari, it is yet unknown why he would visit Tinubu at a property suspected to have been originally bought by Mr Aluko from the proceeds of alleged theft of Nigeria\u2019s oil money.\n\nOyetola ignored multiple requests for him to comment on this story. His spokespersons declined to revert days after they promised to do so.",

In other words, it is to be treated as special and expected to be concluded quickly, especially in situations where the applicant is incarcerated.\n\n\"Today\u2019s outcome is a disappointment. It is my hope that, going forward, there won\u2019t be any further delay in hearing the case.\"\n\nSaharaReporters had reported last month that Ejimakor, in an application, Nnamdi Kanu versus Federal Government of Nigeria and seven others, brought an ex parte order asking the court to, among other things, make an interim order of release of Kanu to attend to his health in any medical facility of his choice in Nigeria, pending the hearing of the motion.\n\nThe lawyer also asked for the substitution service on the motion on notice of third and fourth respondents.\n\nHowever, the high court presided over by Justice K. C. J. Okereke refused the application and asked the lawyer to put the respondents on notice.\n\nHe granted the application for substituted service on third, fifth, and seventh respondents and adjourned till September 21 for a hearing of the motion on notice.\n\nResponding to enquiries in Umuahia, Ejimakor had said, \u201cToday, I secured an Order from the High Court of Abia State to serve by substituted means an Application for enforcement of the Fundamental Rights of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, which I recently brought before the High Court of Abia State. The next hearing date is set for 21st September, 2021 in Umuahia.\"",

          "text": "Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, has supported the position of Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of federation (AGF), on the possibility of declaring a state of emergency in Anambra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been a recent increase in attacks in Anambra, leading to killings and destruction of property.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Wednesday, Malami said declaring a state of emergency would ensure that the November 6 governorship election in the state takes place.\n\nThis position has, however, been greeted with criticism, and the Anambra government has alleged that it is a ploy to destabilise the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a chat with NAN on Thursday, Mohammed said Malami\u2019s position is an effort to avert a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d in the state.\n\n\u201cIn the last couple of weeks, IPOB had imposed sit-at-home on the citizens. They did not allow people to go to schools, markets and there are also high profile killings,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF said yesterday that the government will do whatever it takes to restore law and order in Anambra and the entire south-east to ensure that symbols and pillars of democracy are not tampered with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe forthcoming election in the state is one of the pillars of democracy. Those who are criticising the AGF on this, have they thought for one minute what will happen if the election does not take place in Anambra state on November 6?\n\n\u201cThey should bear in mind that under our constitution, a governor cannot spend an extra day beyond the mandate of four years.

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at Konga,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "text": "The family of Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has for many years secretly owned a web of offshore companies in Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and other tax havens, according to a new leak of documents known as the \u201cPandora Papers\u201d.\n\nThe Kenyattas have dominated Kenyan politics since the country\u2019s independence in 1963. In addition to the vast political power amassed over the decades, they are believed to be one of the richest families in the country \u2013 with significant interests in the financial services, hospitality, agriculture, and media sectors.\n\nIn 2018, President Kenyatta told the BBC \u2013 while stating his intention to fight corruption and promote transparency \u2013 that his family\u2019s wealth was known to the public, and that he had declared his assets as required by law.\n\nHowever, secret offshore assets belonging to the Kenyattas have been uncovered by an investigation published on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Finance Uncovered, Africa Uncensored, and other news organisations.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe secrets were discovered from almost 12 million documents from the archives of 14 law firms and agencies that specialise in offshore company formations. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and processed by more than 600 journalists, as part of a global investigation that\u2019s taken around two years.\n\nSeven members of the Kenyatta family, including the president, are revealed, through the Pandora Papers, as being variously connected to more than 10 offshore companies and foundations. The Kenyattas\u2019 offshore investments include a company with stocks and bonds worth $30 million.\n\nLargest-ever leak\n\nThe Pandora Papers represent the latest and largest, by data volume, in a series of major leaks of financial data about the offshore world over the last five years.\n\nIn 2016, the Panama Papers, which consisted of 2.6 terabytes of data, leaked from the law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The following year saw the release of the Paradise Papers, worth 1.4 terabytes of data.\n\nContaining 2.94 terabytes, the Pandora Papers is the largest of the three leaks. The files come from a much wider array of offshore providers than previous leaks, with locations ranging from Vietnam, Belize, and Singapore, to the Bahamas and Seychelles.\n\nThe papers expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state. Other world leaders named in the Pandora Papers include Gabon\u2019s President Ali Bongo Ondimba; President of Congo-Brazzaville, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nLinks were found between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including ministers, judges, mayors, and military generals from 117 countries.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars, and business leaders.\n\nThe global offshore economy enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and, in some cases, pay little or no tax. Also, many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts, as well as hidden bank accounts and art. For politicians, these help them loot state resources.\n\nOther African countries featured\n\nUp to 10 Nigerian politicians are implicated in the Pandora Papers, including former Anambra State governor Peter Obi, according to findings from the leaked documents. Fellow major African oil producer, Angola, has nine politicians.\n\nFive Ivorian politicians and three Ghanaian public officials were helped by foreign agents to stash money suspected to be looted away.\n\nChad, Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Congo Brazzaville have two politicians apiece, Gabon has three politicians while Mozambique has one.\n\n\u201cThese reports will go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe,\u201d President Kenyatta\u2019s spokesperson, Kanze Dena Mararo, said in response to the ICIJ Pandora Papers leaks, without contesting the allegations.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

You must be able to prove that you have been fully vaccinated under a vaccination programme and have a valid proof of vaccination recognised by the British Government (for Nigeria, the certificates with valid QR codes as issued by Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency are recognised),\u201d the statement reads.\n\nRead Also: Snag for travellers as UK blacklists Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine certificate\n\nThose who are not a fully vaccinated traveller from Nigeria to England, must take a pre-departure COVID-19 test; to be taken in the three days before travel.\n\nThese travellers must book and pay for day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 tests \u2013 to be taken after arrival and complete a passenger locator form \u2013 any time in the 48 hours before arrival.\n\nThose who are not a fully vaccinated traveller after arrival must quarantine at home or in the place you are staying for 10 days, take a pre-booked COVID-19 test on or before day 2 and on or after day 8.\n\nBen Llewellyn-Jones, acting British High Commissioner, said: \u201cThe exemption of fully-vaccinated Nigerians travelling to the UK from providing a pre-departure test and self-isolating for 10 days, is a very welcome development. To make this happen, we have been working closely with Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency on recognising Nigeria\u2019s vaccine certification, which we have now done.\n\n\u201cThe UK remains committed to opening up international travel and enabling those who wish to enter the UK, to do so safely.\n\nVaccines work and \u2013 as the pandemic has shown \u2013 no one is safe until we are all safe.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday presented Nigeria\u2019s 2022 appropriation bill before lawmakers, seeking the approval of the N16.39 trillion budget which has been tagged \u201cBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability.\u201d\n\nThe highlights of the budget have been summarised in 5 insightful numbers.\n\nN6.26trn\n\nThe total fiscal operations of the Federal Government is expected to result in a deficit of N6.26 trillion in 2022, an amount that is larger than the country\u2019s entire budget in 2016.\n\nThe deficit could however be much higher if Nigeria sticks to its expenditure plan. This is because if the projected revenue of N10.13 trillion follows the trajectory of previous targets, the country could end up with less. Nigeria has attained an average of 55 percent revenue performance since 2016 and that has made analysts criticise the government for raising the bar each year despite obvious challenges in attaining revenue targets. If the same applied in 2022, Abuja could be staring at revenues of N5.57 trillion and a deficit of N10.82 trillion at the end of the year. That\u2019s about the size of the country\u2019s entire 2020 budget.\n\nA higher than planned deficit would lead to further borrowings which puts Nigeria in an even more precarious situation given that its debt service costs relative to revenue is already unsustainable.\n\nN6.83trn\n\nNigeria plans to spend as much as N6.83 trillion on non-debt recurrent expenditure in 2022, 41.7 percent of the total budget.\n\nThat\u2019s the single largest expenditure item in the budget and equates to double of Nigeria\u2019s total revenues in 2020.\n\nThe figure is also higher than the N5.35 trillion budgeted for capital expenditure and debt service of N3.61 trillion.\n\nThe budget throws up concerns over the high cost of governance in Nigeria.\n\nRead also: Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability \u2013 Full speech\n\nN3.16 trillion\n\nOil revenue is projected at N3.16 trillion in the budget proposal, making it the single largest source of expected revenue for 2022. It also marks an upgrade from the N2.01 trillion that was budgeted for this year (2021).\n\nNon-oil revenues are estimated to rake in N2.13 trillion, up from N1.49 trillion in 2021 while Independent revenues are projected to contribute N1.82 trillion.\n\nOil revenues took a bearing in 2020 amid low oil prices and Buhari said in his presentation that lower than planned oil revenues were mainly responsible for actual revenues trailing the budget by 34 percent in the first six months of 2021.\n\nOil revenues may struggle yet again next year if Nigeria\u2019s production challenges linger and the expensive petrol subsidy continues to erase the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nThe budget proposal is predicated on an oil price of $57 per barrel and daily oil production of 1.88 million barrels a day. This includes condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 daily.\n\nN63.38bn\n\nNigeria is yet again expecting money to come from Grants and Aid despite receiving nothing from this source since 2018, according to budget implementation reports available on the website of the finance ministry.\n\nThe total revenue available to fund the 2022 Federal Budget is estimated at N10.13 trillion and it includes the revenues of 63 Government-Owned Enterprises as well as Grants and Aid.\n\n4.2%\n\nThe projected GDP growth rate for 2022 is 4.2 percent, a growth that if achieved will be Nigeria\u2019s highest GDP growth in eight years.\n\nThe projection is more optimistic than that of the International Monetary Fund which expects the economy to post 2.6 percent growth in 2022.\n\nOther highlights of the budget\n\nN410\n\nExchange rate was pegged at N410.15 per US Dollar while\n\n13%\n\nInflation is expected to average 13 percent. The rate is currently running at 17 percent which is well above the CBN\u2019s preferred band of between 6-9 percent.",

          "text": "The American pharmaceutical giant Moderna has outlined infrastructure endowment as well as political stability as part of conditions for locating its planned five hundred million dollars covid manufacturing plant in Africa. It already has a short list of five African countries but won\u2019t say if Nigeria has a chance.\n\nModerna which is keeping the short list of five countries to its chest, also listed well educated workforce suitable for a high-tech messenger RNA factory. In July, Pfizer ignored Nigeria and chose South Africa to host its own covid plant and Senegal has been mentioned as a possible candidate by other global pharmaceutical companies.\n\nA decision on which African country will host the plant is to be taken in the coming months, says CEO Stephane Bancel. The hosting rights come with significant well paying jobs, technology acquisition capable of spurring advancement in the pharmaceutical and allied sectors and the country that eventually wins can brag about its credentials in a world where investment decisions like this help determine your power and influence.\n\nRead Also: Study shows Moderna vaccine creates twice as many antibodies as Pfizer\n\nThere is a short list of some five African countries with the political stability, infrastructure and educated workforce suitable for a high-tech messenger RNA factory, Bancel said. Moderna plans to talk to those countries and make a decision where to build the African plant in the coming months, Bancel said.\n\nThe $500m African plant will be capable of producing half a billion messenger RNA vaccine doses a year. Moderna will start working on site selection soon, it said. It is unclear if Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous nation which has lost out in previous deals is in contention to win the battle to host the Moderna plant.\n\nIn a statement, the company said that the new factory would produce the drug substance for messenger RNA vaccines, including its Covid-19 vaccine and shots for other diseases, and potentially also have vial-filling capabilities.\n\nModerna has been under pressure to make its vaccine in Africa, the continent with the lowest immunization rate.\n\nThe other main manufacturers of mRNA vaccines for Covid-19, Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, announced a deal in July to start producing shots at a facility in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nIn an interview, Moderna CEO Bancel said the aim was to build a factory comparable to the company\u2019s main U.S. production facility in Norwood, Massachusetts. It will be owned and operated by Moderna but staffed mostly with local workers.\n\nThe deal wouldn\u2019t involve transfer of intellectual property, Bancel said. He noted that the company has previously said it won\u2019t enforce its patents related to Covid vaccines during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the mRNA technology to Africa and build a plant there,\u201d Bancel said.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech plan to start producing their Covid-19 vaccine at a Biovac Institute facility in Cape Town. Biovac is partly owned by the South African government.\n\nThe companies have said they plan to begin producing finished doses in 2022. Unlike the Moderna plant, which will produce the active mRNA ingredients for vaccines, the Biovac facility will be focused on the final stage of the manufacturing process, vial filling and packaging.",

          "title": "Patients throng hospitals as striking Nigerian doctors resume",
          "text": "The resumption by members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) on Wednesday after a nine-week industrial action was a big relief for many Nigerians who have had to endure their long absence from work.\n\nRegina Ameh had been booked for surgery at the Asokoro District Hospital, Abuja, before the resident doctors commenced the indefinite strike action on 2 August .\n\nBut Mrs Ameh, who is in her 40s, had to cope with \u201cexcruciating\u201d pain while the strike lasted.\n\nShe was, therefore, one of the first patients to arrive at the hospital on Wednesday, saying she had waited and prayed fervently for the strike to end.\n\n\u201cI have fibroids and it was to be removed via surgery when suddenly the strike started. I cried as if the world would end,\u201d she told PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 reporter on Wednesday.\n\nSimilarly, 35-year-old Musa Shehu said he has been registered with the hospital for a long time and was used to the place, and that he couldn\u2019t afford private hospitals.\n\n\u201cSo I am happy that the doctors are available to attend to us today. I have been waiting for this day,\u201d Mr Shehu said.\n\nAt the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Ebute-Metta, Lagos, doctors, nurses, laboratory scientists and attendants were busy attending to patients who had visited the facility in their large numbers.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t know if anyone will have the time to talk to you because a lot of samples have been coming in unlike the last time you came that we were less busy,\u201d a laboratory scientist, who does not want to be mentioned, told our reporter at the hospital.\n\nAt the maternity unit of the facility, a nurse, who also does not want to be quoted, said as of Wednesday afternoon, 35 pregnant women were already attended to by the doctors.\n\n\u201cOf the 35, 14 are new mothers. Before the strike, we used to see an average of 40 per day. So the number is still in order,\u201d the nurse said.\n\nThe situation was similar at Wuse District Hospital, where all the departments were opened and staff of all categories including doctors were busy attending to patients.\n\nBut at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Josiah Isaac, who had visited the hospital from Ogijo, a nascent community in Ogun State that shares boundary with Lagos State, said as of 12 noon, he was yet to be attended to by the doctors.\n\nMr Isaac, in his 60s, who had visited the urology unit of the hospital for a check-up, said he did not bother to show up during the strike.\n\n\u201cDuring the strike, I only continued with the drugs they prescribed for me, I didn\u2019t bother to come. Now, coming from a far place and not yet attended to by the doctor can be frustrating,\u201d he lamented.\n\nFrank Ekwere had also returned his mother, Grace Ekwere, to the hospital on Wednesday after they were turned back on 15 September when the old woman developed a \u201crespiratory and rheumatology-related medical crisis.\u201d\n\nAccording to the son, as a result of the strike, a private drug store owner was consulted and had been managing the mother until the suspension of the industrial action by the doctors.\n\n\u201cMy mother cannot work alone without being assisted. But now that the strike is over, she has been attended to this morning and we have been asked to go for some medical tests, as usual,\u201d Mr Ekwere told our reporter.\n\nAt the Kubwa General Hospital, Abuja, scores of patients were seen being attended to by the healthcare workers when our reporter visited on Wednesday.\n\nFor instance, the eye clinic, which was under lock while the strike lasted, was opened on wednesday with patients receiving care.\n\nEmeka Ani, a Kubwa resident, who was at the eye clinic for a check-up, expressed relief that the strike was suspended.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, the hospital is full today unlike when the strike was on. I just hope they don\u2019t go on strike for this long again,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the maternal unit, scores of patients and their relatives could also be seen waiting for turns.\n\nDaniel Mbah, who said his wife was in the labour room, said there was noticeable change in activities at the hospital.\n\nBusinesses boom again\n\nMeanwhile, traders and business owners within the location of hospitals\u2019 neighbourhoods have expressed satisfaction that the strike by the resident doctors was over.\n\nOladeinde Lucas is the owner of Foodie Restaurant at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi Araba, who was excited that the strike was over.\n\nAccording to Mr Lucas, the strike by the doctors had created an atmosphere that was similar to what he experienced during the lockdown that was imposed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cWhile the strike lasted, this place was like a ghost town. I didn\u2019t know that the resident doctors were so important. Business was poor but we hope things will pick up now,\u201d He told our reporter.\n\nHe, however, noted that he could not prepare much meal since it was just the first day of resumption. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to gamble because we suspected many people may not know about the resumption yet.\u201d\n\nA food seller at the Asokoro District Hospital who is popularly called Hajiya was also happy that her business has started improving.\n\nShe said, though the strike lingered for too long, \u201ceveryone is happy that the doctors are back to work.\u201d\n\nAlso, a seller of Okpa, a local delicacy, who identified herself simply as Rachael, said the long strike affected her daily income. \u201cI was still bringing Okpa to this place as usual but the strike really affected sales.\u201d\n\nAlso, at the National Hospital, Abuja, Rose Oman, who sells bananas opposite the hospital, hailed the doctors for calling off the strike.\n\n\u201cI have made a lot of sales today unlike in previous weeks during the strike,\u201d Ms Oman said.\n\nOther people selling items such as corn, groundnuts and oranges were also having a busy day.\n\nBut at the taxi part in front of the hospital, Emeka Akpa, a driver, said passengers were yet to patronise them like before.\n\nHe hopes that in the coming days normalcy would return.\n\nStudents speak\n\nA medical student at the College of Medicine of the University of Lagos (CMUL), Idi-Araba, Obianyor Chinedu, said with the resident doctors returning to work, learning could be fun again.\n\nAccording to the student, since the consultants were busy with the patients and other engagements that should ordinarily be handled by the resident doctors, there was little the students could learn during practical classes.\n\n\u201cThe resident doctors have been very busy since they resumed today. They like to teach and they usually join the consultants to teach us but during the strike we were taught by only the consultants and because they were also the ones taking care of all patients, the workload couldn\u2019t allow them to give us enough attention,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that though the strike didn\u2019t affect the academic calendar, it impacted negatively on the practical classes.\n\nAnother student, who resumed an internship programme at the hospital two weeks ago, said she had seen the difference between when there was a strike and now that the doctors have resumed.\n\nDoctors speak\n\nMost of the NARD members that our reporters spoke to offered to speak only on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile some of them are excited to return to work, they also hope that the Nigerian government will fulfill its own sides of the agreements.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, we have resumed but that only depends on how the government responds to our demands. At least, in the interest of the patients we would not like to stay out of work again,\u201d a resident doctor at the Kubwa general hospital, Abuja, said.\n\nLasisi Muiden, the hospital\u2019s Chief Medical Director (CMD), also expressed relief with the resumption by the resident doctors. He said full activities are gradually returning to all the wards and departments in the hospital.\n\n\u201cGo around, you can see that every unit and department is very busy. The resident doctors are fully back and we hope it stays that way,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Muiden,however, did not provide any response on what will happen to the locum doctors and members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) who were engaged to fill the vacuum created by the striking doctors.\n\nAnother doctor at the Asokoro District Hospital also declined to disclose his identity, but said: \u201cYes, the strike is off and we are just resuming back to work. I\u2019m yet to attend to any patient but I will do that shortly. That\u2019s all I can say for now.\u201d\n\nAbout the strike\n\nOn 2 August , resident doctors, who are doctors undergoing residency to become consultants, had commenced the industrial strike over what they described as poor treatment by both the federal and some state governments.\n\nThis category of doctors, who constitute a large percentage of doctors in Nigeria\u2019s tertiary hospitals, had demanded, among others, payment of COVID-19 treatment allowances in the absence of death-in-service insurance, having lost over a dozen of its members to the pandemic, even as they also protested the shortage of manpower in public hospitals.\n\nThe strike coincided with a spike in COVID-19 cases in the country, leaving many worried that it could have serious consequences for the battle against the third wave of the pandemic.\n\nSeries of meetings between the leaders of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), NARD, and government representatives also failed to resolve the issues after the striking doctors insisted they could not trust the government.\n\nDespite the National Industrial Court (NIC) ordering members of NARD to return to their duty posts, the doctors vowed to continue the strike until all demands are met.\n\nThe NMA, the Medical and Dental Consultants\u2019 Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) and the Medical and Dental Doctors in Academics (MEDSABAM) are also threatening to commence strike if the government fails to resolve the pending issues.\n\nThe Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU), which comprises other categories of health workers in the country, has also threatened to down tools should the government fail to heed its requests.\n\nBut early Monday morning, the union announced the suspension of the industrial action, while urging the government to fulfill its own part of the agreement that led to the suspension of the action.\n\nThe NARD president, Godiya Ishaya, told PREMIUM TIMES that the union would observe the government\u2019s compliance to the deal and act appropriately when necessary.\n\nContributors to this report include Medinat Kanabe, Ebuka Onyeji, Nike Adebowale and Mariam Ileyemi.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Nigerian Army has said it arrested veteran actor, Mr. Chiwetalu Agu, whom it described as \u201cone Chiwetalu Agu\u201d for inciting members of the public and soliciting support for the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nA video showing soldiers manhandling the actor who adorned himself in Biafra colours at Upper Iweka, Onitsha, Anambra State, before being taken away, went viral on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the Army, which confirmed his arrest in a statement by its Director of Public Relations, Brig. General Onyema Nwachukwu, on Thursday, denied assaulting him.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cTroops of Nigerian Army(NA) have arrested one Chiwetalu Agu while inciting members of the public and soliciting for support for the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Dressed in a very well known attire of the proscribed group, Chiwetalu Agu was picked up for questioning while inciting members of the public to join the proscribed group. Though he attempted puting up some resistance when troops made effort to take him into custody, he was not assaulted or subjected to brutalization.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA recognizes the inalienable rights of the citizenry to freedom of movement and expression as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, it is apparently a violation for any individual or group to incite the public to cause mayhem or break down of law and order. It is therefore pertinent to state that while exercising such freedoms, it must be done within the confines of the law, bearing in mind the imperative for peace, and national security.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt and emphasis, the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) remains proscribed . Therefore, any individual or group seen to be projecting and advancing the cause or activities of the group is viewed as brazenly challenging the constitutionality of Federal Republic of Nigeria. More worrisome, was the fact that considering the prevailing security situation of the region, coupled with the ongoing Exercise GOLDEN DAWN , his action could be a tacit endorsement and support for the proscribed group. We have all witnessed the activities of the group take a violent dimension in recent times.\n\n\u201cChinwetalu Agu has clearly demonstrated uncharitable disposition to negate peace and security in the region, hence, he is taken into custody for preliminary investigation. It is important to once again place on record that the allegation that he was brutalized is false and should be disregarded accordingly.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA would not allow IPOB and its sponsors to hold the region captive and allow the security situation to degenerate, it is instructive to restate that national interest supercedes any parochial consideration. Individuals or groups who fan the embers of violence are warned to desist or face the consequences of their actions. The ongoing Exercises are on course and will rid the region of all forms of criminality.\n\n\u201cThe peace loving and law abiding people of the South East are enjoined to please go about their normal activities, as efforts are ongoing to bring perpetrators of violence to book. They are equally urged to continue to support the security agencies to restore normalcy to the region in furtherance of peace.\u201d",

          "text": "PETER OKORE, Umuahia\n\nThe Abia State chapter of Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA), has affirmed that the greatest hindrance to building well in Nigeria is the neglect of professionals in handling building development schemes.\n\nThis is even as the stakeholders, comprising Surveyors, Architects, Town Planners, Engineers, among others, suggested that to achieve better Urban future, all the professions in the Built Environment must be allowed to play their roles optimally.\n\nThese are contained in an address presented at the 2021 Architects Forum held in Umuahia, Abia capital with the theme: \u201cTowards A Better Urban Future: How To Build Well.\u201d\n\nArc. Anagha Ndukwo Anagha, Chairman Abia State chapter of Nigerian Institute of Architects, in his presentation, decried the alarming rate of quack -practices in the industry, both in the private and public sector, which has resulted in incessant building collapses and an avalanche of failed buildings.\n\nArc. Anagha maintained that building well remains the fulcrum for achieving a better urban future.\n\nSaid he: \u201cOwing to the peculiar circumstances of our Urban Environment, we carefully chose this theme to continue the discourse commenced last year. Last year\u2019s Forum highlighted the peculiar problems facing the built environment in our urban cities, and zeroed on necessary measures to solve the problem of incessant building collapse.\n\n\u201cThere is an alarming rate of quack practices in the industry both in the private and public sector, thus resulting into the incessant building collapses noticed everywhere, and an avalanche of failed buildings, which is even more dangerous. This is however, a silent killer that very often remains unnoticed by its prospective victims.\u201d\n\nAnagha expressed optimism that the forum would lay the foundations for a better understanding of how to build well within Abia State in particular and in the Nation at large, adding, \u201cIt is also our expectation that potential developers and building occupants would have been taught the need to involve the relevant Built Environment Professionals at every stage of the building development process, from conceptualization to implementation as well as post construction stages.\u201d\n\nIn his keynote address titled, \u201cTowards A Better Urban Future: How To Build Well\u201d, the Medical Director, Federal Medical Center (FMC) Umuahia, Prof. Azubuike Onyebuchi, pointed out that the present day urban centre is bedeviled with urban sprawl; individual control/small parcels of land; housing affordability; climate change; water and sanitation; consumption/ misuse of public spaces; air quality and housing; poor planning of our present urban; abuse/neglect to standard practices and poor regulatory framework.\n\nHe described the theme of the forum as a wake up call to all and sundry, especially the Policy Makers and the indolent in building industry, advising that planning and design creation should consider sustainable and affordable housing; green roofs; sustainable transportation: balloon technology; energy efficiency among others, which according to him are the engine room of securing better urban future.\n\nThe former National President, Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Mr. Lekwa Ezutah in his speech, called for a convocation of the seven professions in the Built Environment to interact and ensure that each body is allowed to play its role to give the society the best; and ensure that all the problems in the Built Environment is minimized.\n\nIn a brief speech, the Chairman of the occasion and NIA Abia State chapter Chairman, Education Committee, Dr. Eneogwe Innocent encouraged student- architects to always identify with the Institute to get exposed and be better equipped for the task ahead and to make Nigeria great by embracing the high sense of professionalism.\n\nMeanwhile, the NIA President, Mr.Sonny Echono whose address was read by the NIA Chairman Disciplinary Committee, Mba Aja, advised that the natural green areas in \u201cour cities must be protected and properly maintained to enable the cities regenerate more efficiently and sustainably.\u201d\n\nHis words, \u201cAs we continue to see the adverse consequences of climate change worsen by the years, it is becoming quite obvious that as Architects responses to them must take centre- stage. Renewable energy must be incorporated into mainstream Architecture, while ensuring that our buildings are designed to be more environmentally friendly and energy efficient. On its part, Government must support the push to a zero-emission world as a matter of urgent priority; while we of the Nigerian Institute of Architects will through our Climate Action and Sustainable Development Initiatives, support Government by proposing practical solutions in infrastructure and housing for immediate implementation in the battle against Climate change.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Thursday said his administration\u2019s commitment to sports development is aimed at continuously preaching and spreading the messages of love, unity, hope and development in the state.\n\nHe said the initiative was geared towards engendering peaceful coexistence, sustaining Osun\u2019s status as the most peaceful State in the country and achieving the goal of speedy transformation of the socioeconomic development of the State.\n\nThe Governor reaffirmed his Administration\u2019s commitment to ensuring adequate implementation of the State\u2019s Youth Policy Statement designed to promote Youth Education, Youth Empowerment, Youth Entrepreneurship and Youth Engagement.\n\nThis is even as the Governor declared the year 2021 Osun Sports Festival closed after its finals competition at Osogbo City Stadium.\n\nAddressing the participants, Governor Oyetola said his Administration had recorded huge success in its resolve to diversify the economy to non-oil sectors in which the sports had received adequate attention of government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWithout any iota of doubt, this Sports Festival, which is now culminating into its finals today, is another giant stride by this Administration. It stems from our avowed and determined quest to transform sports and youth development in our State.\n\n\u201cFrom time immemorial, sports have been used to establish ties and build camaraderie among people all over the world. In line with this time-tested objective, we are employing sports to preach and spread the messages of love, unity, hope and development so that we can continue to sustain our status as the most peaceful State in the country and achieve our goal of transforming our socioeconomic development.\n\n\u201cSport stands as the cornerstone of our proud heritage and shares unmistakable attributes with our way of life. It has accorded us an avenue to display our creativity and stimulate perseverance, diligence and strong sense of commitment among our people. It has also underscored our belief that sport is a potent instrument for building character.\n\n\u201cAs you already know, sports development is one of the major ways to harness and empower our teeming youths. This festival has therefore provided the opportunity not only to engage our youths productively, but to also harness their latent potential for productive engagement.\n\n\u201cI wish to emphasise here that the aim of this project is to institute the State Policy on Sports as enshrined in the State Youth Policy.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the above objective, we have put this together to discover hidden talents in various sports in our Local Government Areas, harness and groom them to stardom. This will eventually boost the performance of the State athletes at various national and international competitions.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Commissioner for Youth and Sport, Yemi Lawal had lauded the avowed commitment of Governor Oyetola to youth development in the State.\n\nLawal who described youths as the most energetic and productive segment of the population, praised the Administration for investing tremendously in the sector, saying, \u201cIt has been the focus of the present Administration under the leadership of our able and dynamic Governor to develop sports at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the support of our dear Governor, who feels nothing is impossible to accomplish. Naturally no one believed that this was possible, but it is his belief in us that led us to where we are today.\n\n\u201cSome of the efforts and prompt interventions of the Governor Oyetola-led Administration to turn around the sector are: appointment of 42 Local Government Sports Coordinators, including the Zonal and State Coordinators for a robust coordination of sports at the grassroot; approval and funding of state participation at various sports competitions, including the just-concluded 20th National Sports Festival held in Edo State, \u201cEDO 2020\u2033, despite all the postponements; approval of the compositions and appointments into various Sports Associations in the state; financing the two state teams of Osun United and Osun Babes Football Clubs in their different league; and fencing and renovation of Osogbo City stadium; amongst others.\u201d\n\nAt the finals of the football competition, Ejigbo Local Government Area Football Club won the tournament and secured the trophy by 4-1 against Ife-East Local Government Area Football Club.\n\nOther winners in the other sporting activities were also honoured and rewarded.",

          "text": "Commercial transport operators across Nigeria have resolved to withdraw services from aEbonyi State, beginning today Thursday, October 07, 2021, in protest against attacks on members by thugs said to be working for the state government.\n\nNational chairman of the Association of Mass Transit Operators (AMTO) Chief Gregory Inyaba who made the declaration in Enugu on Wednesday said the blacklisting followed unprovoked attacks on staff and facilities, particularly vehicles of members by cultists and thugs allegedly engaged by the Ebonyi State Government officials.\n\nAccording to him, staff of transport companies in the state capital have been decapitated and numerous vehicles damaged since attacks by government-approved thugs began the onslaught against transporters on Tuesday.\n\nInyaba who spoke at the end of an emergency meeting of AMTO executive at its national headquarters in Enugu, said members of Public Transport Owner Association of Nigeria, were also part of the boycott decision.\n\n\u201cFrom Thursday, October 7, 2021, no commercial vehicle shall go to Ebonyi or leave the state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government of Ebonyi State has asked us to leave the state and we have no choice but leave the state for them henceforth.\u201d\n\nInyaba regretted that vehicles belonging to members, with passengers, from other states were similarly attacked on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHow can you attack vehicles coming into Ebonyi with passengers from other states? It means we can\u2019t bring in people in safety and comfort, and that is a declaration of hostility,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe directed members of all transport unions in other states of the country to note the directive to boycott Ebonyi State from Thursday, and comply accordingly.\n\n\u201cDo not load passengers from anywhere to Ebonyi State, and members who are inside Ebonyi State must not load passengers out of the state, no matter the circumstances,\u201d he restated.\n\nThe union condemned the attempt by the Ebonyi State Commissioner for Transport to force their members to abandon their well-developed premises/depots within the state capital and move to virgin farmland in the outskirts, without first developing the premises.\n\nAttacks on commercial buses in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi state capital intensified yesterday (Wednesday) as armed thugs working for the state government smashed up additional vehicles in apparent determination to force operators out of the capital territory vicinity.\n\nMass transit owners and businesses in the state capital have been under siege since Tuesday when Commissioner for transportation Onyebuchi Nwebonyi led daredevil thugs around the Abakaliki township, smashing up vehicles, and forcefully sealing up private car parks, in a move that caught operators off grand.\n\nThe week earlier, he had ordered owners of transport business to move to the undeveloped premises on Ikom Road, very far from Abakaliki, an order allegedly sanctioned by the state government.\n\nTalks about the relocation had been muted and seemingly farfetched because the proposed site remained virgin farmland, fully covered with grass and seasonal un-harvested crops.\n\nEach operator had paid various amounts of money ranging from N1 million Naira to N4 million Naira for spaces in the proposed new park, but no development had begun there, making the sudden quit notice out of the capital city, inexplicable, according to the operators.\n\nThe attacks by the thugs on operators on-premises and facilities of operators at Abakaliki which began on Tuesday continued yesterday (Wednesday) as more buses belonging to operators were vandalized by the rampaging thugs.\n\nAlmost all operators had had many buses smashed up since Tuesday. PMT was the worst hit, had eight vehicles damaged on the first day, and two yesterday.\n\nEbonyi State chairman of the Association of Mass Transit Operators (AMTO) Fred Nwogbaga said a scheduled meeting of the state Exco members with the commissioner, Eze Nwachukwu Eze, ended abruptly when the commissioner allegedly excused himself.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to seek to engage the state government to end their brigandage\u201d he promised. \u201cIt is so painful to willfully destroy the investment of law-abiding entities, without justification\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

With teary eyes, his \u201cwork family\u201d called attention of the general public to Cappi\u2019s disciplined and leadership style. They also expressed how it inspired most of them to live their dreams and excel in their diverse careers. He inspired enthusiasm for development across sectors, nationally and internationally.\n\nIn 2016, Cappi achieved another impressive entrepreneurial milestone, when he unveiled a 22,000 acre state-of-the-art facility worth $750 million (N150 billion). The facility, which eventually became a greenhouse farm, was established in the heart of Edo State.\n\nCappi\u2019s dream for agriculture to penetrate every nook and cranny of Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem led to him creating a world-class farm in the state known as \u201cthe Heartbeat of Nigeria \u201d \u2013 a move that highlights the importance of the state towards socio-economic development.\n\nBeyond the physical positioning, the nature and capacity of the farm are noteworthy, underlying Captain Idahosa\u2019s ingenious abilities. The farm has created a whopping 85,000 direct jobs; and indirectly employed thousands more youth and women. This is highly commendable for a country groaning under the weight of a high unemployment rate and several job losses.\n\nSpeaking highly of Captain Hosa\u2019s outstanding efforts and humanitarian impact, The Managing Director of Wells Hosa Farms, Engr. Franklin Owegie said: \u201cBeing one of the business outfits through which the great Edo business icon provided a platform for numerous families to earn a living, the staff of the Wells Hosa Greenhouse Farm are very much beneficiaries of the special growing love with which Captain Hosa (as he was fondly called) related with everybody. He penetrated the world with selfless kindness and establishing endearing friendships without regard to social status, religion, and political affiliations.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the tribute evening held in his honour, those that worked closely with him recounted stories of his endearing personality, warm enthusiasm and many other experiences that made for Cappi\u2019s achievements. They attested that Cappi\u2019s legacy will live on. From the food on our tables to the agricultural opportunities that abound in the country, the presence of Captain Hosa is forever felt.\n\nThe four-day event celebrating Cappi\u2019s final flight kicked off yesterday in Edo State.

          "text": "The Nigerian Army has said troops arrested veteran Nollywood actor, Chiwetalu Agu, for inciting the public and soliciting support for the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe director of Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, said the actor dressed in a well known attire of the proscribed group was picked up for questioning while inciting members of the public to join the proscribed group.\n\nHe said, \u201cthough he attempted puting up some resistance when troops made effort to take him into custody, he was not assaulted or subjected to brutalisation.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the Army recognises the inalienable rights of the citizenry to freedom of movement and expression as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, however, \u201cit is apparently a violation for any individual or group to incite the public to cause mayhem or break down of law and order.\u201d\n\nHe advised that while exercising such freedoms,\u201dit must be done within the confines of the law, bearing in mind the imperative for peace, and national security.\u201d\n\nHe restated that the IPOB remains proscribed and, therefore, any individual or group seen to be projecting and advancing the cause or activities of the group is viewed as brazenly challenging the constitutionality of Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nHe explained that considering the prevailing security situation in the South-East, coupled with the ongoing Exercise GOLDEN DAWN, the actor\u2019s \u201caction could be a tacit endorsement and support for the proscribed group.\u201d\n\n\u201cChinwetalu Agu has clearly demonstrated uncharitable disposition to negate peace and security in the region, hence, he is taken into custody for preliminary investigation. It is important to once again place on record that the allegation that he was brutalized is false and should be disregarded accordingly,\u201d the Army spokesperson added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGen Nwachukwu stated that the Army will not allow IPOB and its sponsors to hold the region captive and allow the security situation to degenerate.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to restate that national interest supercedes any parochial consideration.\n\n\u201cIndividuals or groups who fan the embers of violence are warned to desist or face the consequences of their actions. The ongoing Exercises are on course and will rid the region of all forms of criminality,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Army, therefore, called on law abiding people of the South-East to\n\ngo about their normal activities, as efforts were ongoing to bring perpetrators of violence to book.",

That is how Magboro has been supplied power by the electricity company.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Saturday evening, when the isolator switch was up and there was electricity, some people dropped a sacrifice there. They also chained the switch to keep the electricity on. They placed the sacrifice at the bottom. A palm tree leaf and some charms were placed on the chain.\n\n\u201cBut now, the issue is that no one can go there to pull the switch down, because no one knows who put the sacrifice there.\n\n\u201cAs soon as IBEDC discovered that they could not pull the isolator switch down, they authorised that power be switched off from Oke-Aro. The whole Magboro, Makogi, Oke-Afa, Ibafo 1, Ibafo 2, Orimerimun and all the companies using the electricity have not got power since Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf we know the people that put the sacrifice there, we will have to appeal to them to take it away so we can have a way forward. I believe our traditional rulers are also making efforts to know who put it there; so it\u2019s until they see who put it there that we can move forward.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Olaniyi Bamidele, who noted that none of the residents could have placed the sacrifice at the isolator switch, claimed that he suspected foul play on the part of the IBEDC.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe last time they brought power was Saturday and Sunday morning and we were supposed to have power on Monday because we run on shifts. There was no power on Monday till evening when we got a message on WhatsApp that some people padlocked the isolator switch that would be used to turn on the electricity and that as the sacrifice was put there, the IBEDC said they could not energise power until it is removed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who put the sacrifice there, but from my point of view, Magboro people cannot put sacrifice there. The outage has affected us a lot because there is no power to pump water.\n\n\u201cWe want IBEDC to take us back to the old timetable of two days on and one day off and we also want prepaid meters because some parts of Magboro were given meters last month.\u201d\n\nA resident of Magboro, Oyebola Olufasakin, said power supply in the community had been awful.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine having eight hours of electricity in three days? IBEDC is taking us for granted. When the youth decided that we would not pay for the electricity that we did not enjoy, some old people went to pay behind. The CDC too has been bribed because they are not allowing us to make headway. Instead of them speaking in unison that this is what we want, they are the ones saying it\u2019s the youth that are disturbing the peace of the community. The solution to this issue is for IBEDC to go and we will go back to when we had no power and we will look for another distribution company,\u201d he added.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the isolator switch was still chained and the sacrifice at the same spot, while residents continued to suffer outage.\n\nThe IBEDC\u2019s Media Relations Officer, Busolami Tunwase, could not be reached for comment as of the time of filing this report.

          "title": "Election Tribunal: Governor Dapo Abiodun Accused Of Bribery",
          "text": "The 2019 governorship election in Ogun State and the court fights that followed may not have been heard the last time.\n\nThis comes after Olaposi Oginni, the former Secretary of the Labour Party, accused Governor Dapo Abiodun of bribing to avoid being ousted from office by the election petition tribunal, a charge the governor has denied.\n\nThe Labour Party had sought the tribunal to contest its non-inclusion on the ballot papers used for the governorship race, according to the DAILY POST.\n\nGov. Abiodun allegedly met with the Chairman of the Labour Party in Ogun, Abayomi Arabambi, and handed him an amount of N5 million, according to Oginni.\n\nDuring a live broadcast on Abeokuta\u2019s Splash FM, Oginni said that a governor\u2019s aide had asked him and Arabambi to a meeting with Abiodun in his Oke-Mosan office in Abeokuta, but that he refused to meet the governor with Arabambi present.\n\nFormer Governor Olusegun Osoba reportedly contacted the current Chairman of the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) and convinced him to ensure Gov Abiodun receives an easy landing at the tribunal, according to the current Chairman of the NNPP.\n\nGov. Dapo Abiodun and I are not pals, he said. Arabambi wanted Dapo Abiodun to be sent away after the governorship election in 2019 (I was still in the Labour Party at the time), but Baba Osoba summoned me to his residence in Lagos. He pleaded with me to let Dapo Abiodun finish his tenure as governor, telling me that he would do a better job.\n\n\u201cIf Arabambi and I had stood our grounds that Dapo Abiodun should go as at then, there would have been a rerun election. So, I never sat down with Dapo Abiodun, but he made Baba Osoba his \u2018spokesperson\u2019 then. Nobody will ever use Baba Osoba as his surety and people will doubt such a person. But Dapo Abiodun is an ingrate, the greatest ingrate you can ever meet at that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not into politics for pecuniary gains. I don\u2019t have an agreement with Gov Abiodun. All I want is good governance from him. Let them bring whatever evidence they have out to prove I demanded anything else. We demanded good governance but he failed in that ramification.\n\n\u201cWhen we finished the case, those who helped him in APC and we the opposition party, let Dapo Abiodun and his followers tell us the good thing he did for us, not to talk of good governance for the people. He disappointed himself, not us. His approach was so deceptive that we thought he was a good person who will do what he\u2019s supposed to do. How do you want me to keep quiet when a government is not doing well and I\u2019m in the opposition party.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t collect any money with Arabambi. I never made any monetary agreement with anybody. Arabambi went on his own as a Labour Party member and I am on my own as a Labour Party member too. He never wanted Dapo Abiodun to do this governorship. He stated that Dapo Abiodun didn\u2019t have certificate and all that. But I stood on the truth that this man has been elected as the governor, let\u2019s protect that trophy for him. Let him serve his tenure so we can have good governance.\n\nOginni with Osoba in 2019\n\n\u201cOn getting to Supreme Court, God heard our plea and he was declared winner. One day, Biyi, SA to the governor on political matters, called me that the governor wanted to see me and Arabambi at Oke-Mosan. I said \u2018under my foot will such ever happen!\u2019 I will not come for that meeting. Arabambi called my phones more than 50 times on that day, asking me to come over for the meeting but I said, \u2018for what? You once said Dapo Abiodun won\u2019t serve as the governor because he doesn\u2019t have a certificate. He became the Governor now you want to go and enjoy it with him. I don\u2019t deal with charlatans\u2019.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go for the meeting, but Arabambi went ahead and he was given Five million Naira. Dapo Abiodun, Biyi Adeleye and others at Oke-Mosan are listening presently.\n\n\u201cI was called for the meeting, but I called Baba Osoba that I will not be going because I don\u2019t attend such a meeting. I won\u2019t stand with Dapo Abiodun at his right hand and Arabambi at the left to take pictures. I don\u2019t do such and I won\u2019t do such. Have they not finished spending the N5million?\n\n\u201cThe reason why I have been silent was because I had a meeting with Baba Osoba at Bourdillon. The meeting was held at Baba Osoba\u2019s house, near Tinubu\u2019s in Lagos. I met with all the leaders of APC in Ogun State. We came to an agreement. I fulfilled my own side of the agreement that Dapo Abiodun should govern the State. He refused to fulfill his own agreement, which is good governance. I\u2019m not the only one he didn\u2019t fulfill his agreement to. He is an ungrateful person. I will say it if he is here. He is an ungrateful person,\u201d Oginni fumed.\n\nOgun govt reacts to Oginni\u2019s accusation\n\nHowever, the Gov Abiodun government in Ogun State has reacted to Oginni\u2019s claim that the governor gave money to the Labour Party Chairman.\n\nThe State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Waheed Odusile, said the governor had no such deal with the Labour Party leader, Arabambi.\n\nOdusile, in a telephone conversation with DAILY POST on Thursday, expressed confidence in the governor, saying he would never indulge in any act of bribery.\n\nArabambi with Gov Abiodun in 2019.\n\nOdusile emphatically told our correspondent that there was nothing like what Oginni had said.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing like that. If Oginni is saying whatever, there was nothing like that to the best of our knowledge. I am sure the governor doesn\u2019t indulge in things like that. I said emphatically, there was no anything like that,\u201d Odusile reacted.\n\nOginni lied, I received no gratification from Gov Abiodun \u2013 Arabambi\n\nReacting also, the Labour Party Chairman, Arabambi described the allegation as false, threatening court actions against Oginni, who he said was \u201csuspended and finally dismissed from Ogun Labour Party when he tried very unsuccessfully to bear false witness in the case against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)\u201d in the suit against Abiodun, back then at the tribunal.\n\nThe LP boss asserted that Oginni became the tool for the APC through his sudden collaboration with Chief Ayo Olubori the current, APC State Caretaker Secretary, saying, \u201cAll his efforts at trying to derail the Labour Party\u2019s case against the respondents finally got dismissed at the Appeal Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe went on to claim that I was the individual who was asked to partner with him in a meeting in which he claimed a sum of N5 million was given to me since he himself purposely decidedly not to attend.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that Oginni was never a party to Ogun LP petition and I say very loudly and confidently with all sense of responsibility that at no time did I, Comrade Gentleman Abayomi Oluwafemi Arabambi collect N5m from Gov Dapo Abiodun MFR and neither did Gov Dapo Abiodun nor Hon Biyi Adeleye at any time offer Ogun LP, her candidate Ms Modupeola Ibiwunmi Sanyaolu, our Legal Adviser, Bar Mawah Monday and my humble self any gratification of any sum,\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, I will like to remind Oginni that his various statements on Splash FM Radio interview against my person are not only injurious and damaging, he did it with the sole aim to deliberately defame and consciously assassinate my hard-earned character, which I have laboured so hard over decades to build and thus brought my family name to disrepute and ridicule before Nigerians and lowered my estimation before the whole world.\n\n\u201cI have briefed my Lawyer and instructed him to commence a civil suit in a court of competent jurisdiction, seeking N20 billion as general damages and N10 billion as exemplary and aggravated damages,\u201d Arabambi partly said in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Thursday.",

          "title": "Buhari Presents N16.39trn 2022 Budget Proposal To National Assembly",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday proposed a total budget of N16.39 trillion for the year 2022 to the National Assembly.\n\nSpeaking at the assembly chambers, the President tagged the appropriation bill \u201ca Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\u201d.\n\nHe said the budget will focus on diversifying the economy, with robust MSME growth; investing in critical infrastructure; strengthening security and ensuring good governance; enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace; reducing poverty; and minimizing regional, economic and social disparities.\n\n\u201cDefence and internal security will continue to be our top priority,\u201d the President said. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the 2022 budget is the first time in Nigerian history, \u201cwhere MDAs were clearly advised on gender-responsive budgeting.\n\n\u201cThese are part of critical steps in our efforts to distribute resources fairly and reach vulnerable groups of our society,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, said the National Assembly is committed to passing the budget before the end of the year.\n\nRead President Buhari\u2019s full budget speech here:\n\n2022 BUDGET SPEECH\n\nBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\n\nDelivered By:\n\nHis Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nPresident, Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\nAt the Joint Session of the National Assembly, Abuja\n\nThursday, October 7, 2021\n\nPROTOCOLS\n\n1. It is my great pleasure to be here once again to present the 2022 Federal Budget Proposals to this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly.\n\n2. Distinguished and Honourable leaders, and members of the National Assembly, let me start by commending you for the expeditious consideration and passage of the Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2021. This further underscores your commitment to our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic and address the various security challenges facing our country.\n\n3. I will also take this opportunity to thank you for the quick consideration and approval of the 2022-2024 Medium-term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper. Our hope is that National Assembly will continue to partner with the Executive by ensuring that deliberations on the 2022 Budget are completed before the end of this year so that the Appropriation Act can come into effect by the first of January 2022.\n\n4. The 2022 Budget will be the last full year budget to be implemented by this administration. We designed it to build on the achievements of previous budgets and to deliver on our goals and aspirations as will be reflected in our soon-to-be launched National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025.\n\n5. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, in normal times, I make use of this opportunity to provide an overview of global and domestic developments in the current year, a summary of our achievements, and our plans for the next fiscal year.\n\n6. However, these are exceptional times. The grim realities of COVID-19 and its lethal variants are still upon us. From President to Pauper, the virus does not discriminate.\n\n7. This is why our country still maintains its COVID -19 guidelines and protocols in place to protect its citizens and stop the spread of this disease.\n\n8. Over the past few days, we have consulted with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the leadership of the National Assembly on how best to present the 2022 budget proposal keeping in mind the deep-rooted traditions in place and the guidelines for safe mass gatherings.\n\n9. We ultimately decided that the most responsible and respectful approach was to hold a shorter than usual gathering while allowing the Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to provide fuller details of our proposals in a smaller event.\n\n10. I am sure many of you will be relieved as my last budget speech in October 2020 lasted over fifty minutes.\n\n11. Still, over the next few minutes, I will provide key highlights of our 2021 performance as well as our proposals for 2022.\n\nPERFORMANCE OF THE 2021 BUDGET\n\n12. The 2021 \u2018Budget of Economic Recovery and Resilience\u2019 is based on a benchmark oil price of 40 US Dollars per barrel, oil production of 1.6m b/d, and exchange rate of 379 Naira to US Dollar. Furthermore, a Supplementary budget of 982.73 billion Naira was recently enacted to address exigent issues in the Security and Health sectors.\n\n13. Based on the 2021 Fiscal Framework, total revenue of 8.12 trillion Naira was projected to fund aggregate federal expenditure of 14.57 trillion Naira (inclusive of the supplementary budget). The projected fiscal deficit of 6.45 trillion Naira, or 4.52 percent of GDP, is expected to be financed mainly by domestic and external borrowings.\n\n14. By July 2021, Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production averaged one 1.70million barrels (inclusive of condensates) and the market price of Bonny Light crude averaged 68.53 US Dollars per barrel.\n\n15. Accordingly, actual revenues were 34 percent below target as of July 2021, mainly due to the underperformance of oil and gas revenue sources. Federal Government\u2019s retained revenues (excluding Government Owned Enterprises) amounted to 2.61 trillion Naira against the proportionate target of 3.95 trillion Naira for the period.\n\n16. The Federal Government\u2019s share of Oil revenue totalled 570.23 billion Naira as of July 2021, which was 51 percent below target, while non-oil tax revenues totalled 964.13 billion Naira. The poor performance of oil revenue relative to the budget was largely due to the shortfall in production as well as significant cost recovery by NNPC to cover the shortfall between its cost of importing petrol and the pump price.\n\n17. The National Assembly will recall that in March 2020 the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency announced that the price of petrol would henceforth be determined by market forces.\n\n18. However, as the combination of rising crude oil prices and exchange rate combined to push the price above the hitherto regulated price of 145 Naira per litre, opposition against the policy of price deregulation hardened on the part of Labour Unions in particular.\n\n19. Government had to suspend further upward price adjustments while engaging Labour on the subject. This petrol subsidy significantly eroded revenues that should have been available to fund the budget.\n\n20. On a positive note, we surpassed the non-oil taxes target by eleven (11) percent in aggregate. The sustained improvement in non-oil taxes indicates that some of our revenue reforms are yielding positive results. We expect further improvement in revenue collections later in the year as more corporate entities file their tax returns and we accelerate the implementation of our revenue reforms.\n\nImproving Revenue Generation and Administration\n\n21. We have stepped up implementation of the strengthened framework for performance management of government owned enterprises (GOEs), with a view to improve their operational efficiencies, revenue generation and accountability. The 50% cost-to-income ratio imposed on the GOEs in the Finance Act 2020 has contributed significantly to rationalizing wasteful expenditures by several GOEs and enhanced the level of operating surpluses to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). I solicit the cooperation of the National Assembly in enforcing the cost-to-income ratio and other prudential guidelines during your consideration of the budget proposals of the GOEs, which I am also laying before you today.\n\n22. On the expenditure side, as at end of July 2021, a total of six point seven-nine (6.79) trillion Naira had been spent as against the pro-rated expenditure of seven point nine-one (7.91) trillion Naira. Accordingly, a deficit of four point one-seven (4.17) trillion Naira was recorded as at end of July 2021. The deficit was financed through domestic borrowing.\n\n23. Despite our revenue challenges, we have consistently met our debt service commitments. We are also up to date on the payment of staff salaries, statutory transfers, and overhead costs. As at (4th of October 2021, a total of 1.732 trillion Naira had been released for capital expenditure.\n\n24. I am pleased to inform you that we expect to fund MDAs\u2019 capital budget fully by the end of the fiscal year 2021.\n\n25. Capital releases thus far have been prioritised in favour of critical ongoing infrastructural projects in the power, roads, rail, agriculture, health and education sectors.\n\n26. We have made progress on the railway projects connecting different parts of the country. I am glad to report that the Lagos-Ibadan Line is now completed and operational. The Abuja-Kaduna Line is running efficiently. The Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail Line was finally completed and commissioned over thirty (30) years after its initiation.\n\n27. Arrangements are underway to complete the Ibadan-Kano Line. Also, work will soon commence on the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri Line and Calabar-Lagos Coastal Line, which will connect the Southern and Eastern States to themselves and to the North.\n\n28. Progress is also being made on several power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, as well as off-grid solutions, all aimed towards achieving the national goal of optimizing power supply by 2025.\n\n29. I am again happy to report that we continue to make visible progress in our strategic road construction projects like the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan expressway, Apapa \u2013 Oworonsoki expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano expressway, East-West Road and the second Niger bridge. We hope to commission most of these projects before the end of our tenure in 2023.\n\n30. The Pandemic revealed the urgent need to strengthen our health system. Towards this end, we constructed 52 Molecular labs, 520 bed intensive care units, 52 Isolation centres and provision of Personal Protective equipment across 52 Federal Medical Centres and Teaching Hospitals.\n\n31. We continue to push our expenditure rationalization initiatives which we commenced in 2016. For example, on personnel costs, the number of MDAs captured on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System increased from 459 in 2017 to 711 to date.\n\n32. The recent passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, and consequent incorporation of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation should also result in rationalisation of expenditure, as well as increased investments and improved output in the oil and gas industry.\n\n33. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, you will agree with me that a lot has been accomplished over the last year but there is still much to be done. I will now proceed with a review of the 2022 Budget proposal.\n\nTHEME AND PRIORITIES OF THE 2022 BUDGET\n\n34. The allocations to MDAs were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025, which are:\n\na. Diversifying the economy, with robust MSME growth;\n\nb. Investing in critical infrastructure;\n\nc. Strengthening security and ensuring good governance;\n\nd. Enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace;\n\ne. Reducing poverty; and\n\nf. Minimizing regional, economic and social disparities.\n\n35. The 2022 Appropriation therefore is a Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability.\n\n36. Defence and internal security will continue to be our top priority. We remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\n\n37. The 2022 budget is also the first in our history, where MDAs were clearly advised on gender responsive budgeting. These are part of critical steps in our efforts to distribute resources fairly and reach vulnerable groups of our society.\n\nPARAMETERS AND FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS\n\n38. Distinguished Members of the National Assembly, the 2022 to 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper sets out the parameters for the 2022 Budget as follows:\n\na. Conservative oil price benchmark of 57 US Dollars per barrel;\n\nb. Daily oil production estimate of 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day);\n\nc. Exchange rate of four 410.15 per US Dollar; and\n\nd. Projected GDP growth rate of 4.2 percent and 13 percent inflation rate.\n\n2022 REVENUE ESTIMATES\n\n39. Based on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally-collectible revenue is estimated at 17.70 trillion Naira in 2022.\n\n40. Total federally distributable revenue is estimated at 12.72 trillion Naira in 2022 while total revenue available to fund the 2022 Federal Budget is estimated at 10.13 trillion Naira. This includes Grants and Aid of 63.38 billion Naira, as well as the revenues of 63 Government-Owned Enterprises.\n\n41. Oil revenue is projected at 3.16 trillion, Non-oil taxes are estimated at 2.13 trillion Naira and FGN Independent revenues are projected to be 1.82 trillion Naira.\n\nPLANNED 2022 EXPENDITURE\n\n42. A total expenditure of sixteen point three-nine (16.39) trillion Naira is proposed for the Federal Government in 2022. The proposed expenditure comprises:\n\na. Statutory Transfers of 768.28 billion Naira;\n\nb. Non-debt Recurrent Costs of 6.83 trillion;\n\nc. Personnel Costs of 4.11 trillion Naira;\n\nd. Pensions, Gratuities and Retirees\u2019 Benefits 577.0 billion Naira;\n\ne. Overheads of 792.39 billion Naira;\n\nf. Capital Expenditure of 5.35 trillion Naira, including the capital component of Statutory Transfers;\n\ng. Debt Service of 3.61 trillion Naira; and\n\nh. Sinking Fund of 292.71 billion Naira to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nFiscal Balance\n\n43. We expect the total fiscal operations of the Federal Government to result in a deficit of 6.26 trillion Naira. This represents 3.39 percent of estimated GDP, slightly above the 3 percent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. Countries around the world have to of necessity over-shoot their fiscal thresholds for the economies to survive and thrive\n\n44. We need to exceed this threshold considering our collective desire to continue tackling the existential security challenges facing our country.\n\n45. We plan to finance the deficit mainly by new borrowings totalling 5.01 trillion Naira, 90.73 billion Naira from Privatization Proceeds and 1.16 trillion Naira drawdowns on loans secured for specific development projects.\n\n46. Some have expressed concern over our resort to borrowing to finance our fiscal gaps. They are right to be concerned. However, we believe that the debt level of the Federal Government is still within sustainable limits. Borrowings are to specific strategic projects and can be verified publicly.\n\n47. As you are aware, we have witnessed two economic recessions within the period of this Administration. In both cases, we had to spend our way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt.\n\n48. Our target over the medium term is to grow our Revenue-to-GDP ratio from about 8 percent currently to 15 percent by 2025. At that level of revenues, the Debt-Service-to-Revenue ratio will cease to be worrying. Put simply, we do not have a debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge which we are determined to tackle to ensure our debts remain sustainable.\n\n49. Very importantly, we have endeavoured to use the loans to finance critical development projects and programmes aimed at improving our economic environment and ensuring effective delivery of public services to our people. We focused on;\n\na. the completion of major road and rail projects;\n\nb. the effective implementation of Power sector projects;\n\nc. the provision of potable water;\n\nd. construction of irrigation infrastructure and dams across the country; and\n\ne. critical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading Primary Health Care Centres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nInnovations in Infrastructure Financing\n\n50. In 2022, Government will further strengthen the frameworks for concessions and public private partnerships (PPPs). Capital projects that are good candidates for PPP by their nature will be developed for private sector participation.\n\n51. We will also explore available opportunities in the existing ecosystem of green finance including the implementation of our Sovereign Green Bond Programme and leveraging debt-for-climate swap mechanisms.\n\nEnhancing Revenue Mobilisation\n\n52. Our strategies to improve revenue mobilisation will be sustained in 2022 with the goal of achieving the following objectives:\n\na. Enhance tax and excise revenues through policy reforms and tax administration measures;\n\nb. Review the policy effectiveness of tax waivers and concessions;\n\nc. Boost customs revenue through the e-Customs and Single Window initiatives; and\n\nd. Safeguard revenues from the oil and gas sector.\n\n53. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, I commend you for the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021. It is my hope that the implementation of the law will boost confidence in our economy and attract substantial investments in the sector.\n\nFinance Bill 2022\n\n54. In line with our plan to accompany annual budgets with Finance Bills, partly to support the realization of fiscal projections, current tax and fiscal laws are being reviewed to produce a draft Finance Bill 2022.\n\n55. It is our intention that once ongoing consultations are completed, the Finance Bill would be submitted to the National Assembly to be considered alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n56. Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Distinguished and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, this speech would be incomplete without commending the immense, patriotic, and collaborative support of the National Assembly in the effort to deliver socio-economic development and democracy dividends for our people.\n\n57. I wish to assure you of the strong commitment of the Executive to strengthen the relationship with the National Assembly.\n\n58. Nigeria is currently emerging from a very difficult economic challenge. We must continue to cooperate and ensure that our actions are aimed at accelerating the pace of economic recovery so that we can achieve economic prosperity and deliver on our promises to the Nigerian people.\n\n59. The fiscal year 2022 is very crucial in our efforts to ensure that critical projects are completed, put to use and improve the general living conditions of our people.\n\n60. It is with great pleasure therefore, that I lay before this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly, the 2022 Budget Proposals of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n61. I thank you most sincerely for your attention.\n\n62. May God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

We dominated possession and had several opportunities to score but did not do so.\u201d\n\nHaving drawn with Cape Verde and lost to Liberia in earlier qualifiers, a Central African Republic side coached by Swiss Raoul Savoy was given no chance of avoiding defeat in Nigeria.\n\nBut after snatching the lead, a team popularly known as the Wild Beasts survived eight minutes of added time to achieve a famous victory.\n\nCentral African Republic pulled off one of the greatest shocks in African World Cup qualifying despite lacking their star performer, Atletico Madrid midfielder Godfrey Kondogbia.\n\nHe refused to take part in qualifying for the 2022 finals in Qatar, citing poor management of players when he answered previous call-ups.\n\nThe Beasts changed coaches just before qualifying kicked off in September with Savoy put in charge a third time after Ivorian Francois Zahoui departed.\n\nCentral African Republic were ranked 124th in the world this month \u2014 90 places below six-time World Cup qualifiers Nigeria.\n\nRohr In Trouble?\n\nThe only crumb of comfort for the humiliated Super Eagles is that they remain top of Group C halfway through the second qualifying phase despite the loss.\n\nNigeria have six points, Cape Verde and the Central African Republic four each and Liberia three with only the section winners reaching play-offs next March, which will decide the five African qualifiers for the 2022 finals.\n\nAfter hosting Cape Verde and Liberia in Cameroon because the national stadium in Bangui did not meet international standards, rushed improvements will permit the Beasts to play Nigeria at home.\n\nThe countries meet again on Sunday at the Stade Barthelemy Boganda, a 50,000-seat fortress where the Central African Republic seldom fail.\n\nLosing in Lagos will inevitably lead to calls for Nigeria to sack German Rohr, a 68-year-old whose CV includes spells in charge of Gabon, Niger and Burkina Faso.\n\nHe was hired by Nigeria in 2016 and his recent contract renewal included demands that he win the 2021/2022 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and qualify for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nCape Verde snatched a 2-1 away win over Liberia in the same section through a stoppage-time goal from Garry Rodrigues after teammate Jamiro Monteiro had equalised.\n\nBenin boosted their chances of winning Group J with a 1-0 victory in Tanzania through a goal from Steve Mounie, who played for Huddersfield Town when they were in the Premier League during the last decade.\n\nThe Squirrels have seven points, two more than the Democratic Republic of Congo, who overcame Madagascar 2-0 in Kinshasa with 35-year-old Dieumerci Mbokani among the scorers for the third straight match.\n\nBenin host Tanzania on Sunday and bottom team Madagascar next month while DR Congo are away to the same two countries before hosting the current leaders in the final round.\n\nMali crushed Kenya 5-0 with Ibrahima Kone scoring a hat-trick and Tunisia trounced Mauritania 3-0 to stay on course to win two of the other groups.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday presented N16.39 trillion 2022 Appropriation Bill to the joint session of National Assembly.\n\nThe appropriation bill tagged \u2018Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\u2019 has defence and Internal security as sector with the highest allocation.\n\nRead the full speech below.\n\n2022 BUDGET SPEECH\n\nBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\n\nDelivered By:\n\nHis Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nPresident, Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\nAt the Joint Session of the National Assembly, Abuja\n\nThursday, October 7, 2021\n\nPROTOCOLS\n\n1. It is my great pleasure to be here once again to present the 2022 Federal Budget Proposals to this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly.\n\n2. Distinguished and Honourable leaders, and members of the National Assembly, let me start by commending you for the expeditious consideration and passage of the Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2021. This further underscores your commitment to our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic and address the various security challenges facing our country.\n\n3. I will also take this opportunity to thank you for the quick consideration and approval of the 2022-2024 Medium-term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper. Our hope is that National Assembly will continue to partner with the Executive by ensuring that deliberations on the 2022 Budget are completed before the end of this year so that the Appropriation Act can come into effect by the first of January 2022.\n\n4. The 2022 Budget will be the last full year budget to be implemented by this administration. We designed it to build on the achievements of previous budgets and to deliver on our goals and aspirations as will be reflected in our soon-to-be launched National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025.\n\n5. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, in normal times, I make use of this opportunity to provide an overview of global and domestic developments in the current year, a summary of our achievements, and our plans for the next fiscal year.\n\n6. However, these are exceptional times. The grim realities of COVID-19 and its lethal variants are still upon us. From President to Pauper, the virus does not discriminate.\n\n7. This is why our country still maintains its COVID -19 guidelines and protocols in place to protect its citizens and stop the spread of this disease.\n\n8. Over the past few days, we have consulted with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the leadership of the National Assembly on how best to present the 2022 budget proposal keeping in mind the deep-rooted traditions in place and the guidelines for safe mass gatherings.\n\n9. We ultimately decided that the most responsible and respectful approach was to hold a shorter than usual gathering while allowing the Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to provide fuller details of our proposals in a smaller event.\n\n10. I am sure many of you will be relieved as my last budget speech in October 2020 lasted over fifty minutes.\n\n11. Still, over the next few minutes, I will provide key highlights of our 2021 performance as well as our proposals for 2022.\n\nPERFORMANCE OF THE 2021 BUDGET\n\n12. The 2021 \u2018Budget of Economic Recovery and Resilience\u2019 is based on a benchmark oil price of 40 US Dollars per barrel, oil production of 1.6m b/d, and exchange rate of 379 Naira to US Dollar. Furthermore, a Supplementary budget of 982.73 billion Naira was recently enacted to address exigent issues in the Security and Health sectors.\n\n13. Based on the 2021 Fiscal Framework, total revenue of 8.12 trillion Naira was projected to fund aggregate federal expenditure of 14.57 trillion Naira (inclusive of the supplementary budget). The projected fiscal deficit of 6.45 trillion Naira, or 4.52 percent of GDP, is expected to be financed mainly by domestic and external borrowings.\n\n14. By July 2021, Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production averaged one 1.70million barrels (inclusive of condensates) and the market price of Bonny Light crude averaged 68.53 US Dollars per barrel.\n\n15. Accordingly, actual revenues were 34 percent below target as of July 2021, mainly due to the underperformance of oil and gas revenue sources. Federal Government\u2019s retained revenues (excluding Government Owned Enterprises) amounted to 2.61 trillion Naira against the proportionate target of 3.95 trillion Naira for the period.\n\n16. The Federal Government\u2019s share of Oil revenue totalled 570.23 billion Naira as of July 2021, which was 51 percent below target, while non-oil tax revenues totalled 964.13 billion Naira. The poor performance of oil revenue relative to the budget was largely due to the shortfall in production as well as significant cost recovery by NNPC to cover the shortfall between its cost of importing petrol and the pump price.\n\n17. The National Assembly will recall that in March 2020 the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency announced that the price of petrol would henceforth be determined by market forces.\n\n18. However, as the combination of rising crude oil prices and exchange rate combined to push the price above the hitherto regulated price of 145 Naira per litre, opposition against the policy of price deregulation hardened on the part of Labour Unions in particular.\n\n19. Government had to suspend further upward price adjustments while engaging Labour on the subject. This petrol subsidy significantly eroded revenues that should have been available to fund the budget.\n\n20. On a positive note, we surpassed the non-oil taxes target by eleven (11) percent in aggregate. The sustained improvement in non-oil taxes indicates that some of our revenue reforms are yielding positive results. We expect further improvement in revenue collections later in the year as more corporate entities file their tax returns and we accelerate the implementation of our revenue reforms.\n\nImproving Revenue Generation and Administration\n\n21. We have stepped up implementation of the strengthened framework for performance management of government owned enterprises (GOEs), with a view to improve their operational efficiencies, revenue generation and accountability. The 50% cost-to-income ratio imposed on the GOEs in the Finance Act 2020 has contributed significantly to rationalizing wasteful expenditures by several GOEs and enhanced the level of operating surpluses to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). I solicit the cooperation of the National Assembly in enforcing the cost-to-income ratio and other prudential guidelines during your consideration of the budget proposals of the GOEs, which I am also laying before you today.\n\n22. On the expenditure side, as at end of July 2021, a total of six point seven-nine (6.79) trillion Naira had been spent as against the pro-rated expenditure of seven point nine-one (7.91) trillion Naira. Accordingly, a deficit of four point one-seven (4.17) trillion Naira was recorded as at end of July 2021. The deficit was financed through domestic borrowing.\n\n23. Despite our revenue challenges, we have consistently met our debt service commitments. We are also up to date on the payment of staff salaries, statutory transfers, and overhead costs. As at (4th of October 2021, a total of 1.732 trillion Naira had been released for capital expenditure.\n\n24. I am pleased to inform you that we expect to fund MDAs\u2019 capital budget fully by the end of the fiscal year 2021.\n\n25. Capital releases thus far have been prioritised in favour of critical ongoing infrastructural projects in the power, roads, rail, agriculture, health and education sectors.\n\n26. We have made progress on the railway projects connecting different parts of the country. I am glad to report that the Lagos-Ibadan Line is now completed and operational. The Abuja-Kaduna Line is running efficiently. The Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail Line was finally completed and commissioned over thirty (30) years after its initiation.\n\n27. Arrangements are underway to complete the Ibadan-Kano Line. Also, work will soon commence on the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri Line and Calabar-Lagos Coastal Line, which will connect the Southern and Eastern States to themselves and to the North.\n\n28. Progress is also being made on several power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, as well as off-grid solutions, all aimed towards achieving the national goal of optimizing power supply by 2025.\n\n29. I am again happy to report that we continue to make visible progress in our strategic road construction projects like the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan expressway, Apapa \u2013 Oworonsoki expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano expressway, East-West Road and the second Niger bridge. We hope to commission most of these projects before the end of our tenure in 2023.\n\n30. The Pandemic revealed the urgent need to strengthen our health system. Towards this end, we constructed 52 Molecular labs, 520 bed intensive care units, 52 Isolation centres and provision of Personal Protective equipment across 52 Federal Medical Centres and Teaching Hospitals.\n\n31. We continue to push our expenditure rationalization initiatives which we commenced in 2016. For example, on personnel costs, the number of MDAs captured on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System increased from 459 in 2017 to 711 to date.\n\n32. The recent passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, and consequent incorporation of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation should also result in rationalisation of expenditure, as well as increased investments and improved output in the oil and gas industry.\n\n33. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, you will agree with me that a lot has been accomplished over the last year but there is still much to be done. I will now proceed with a review of the 2022 Budget proposal.\n\nTHEME AND PRIORITIES OF THE 2022 BUDGET\n\n34. The allocations to MDAs were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025, which are:\n\na. Diversifying the economy, with robust MSME growth;\n\nb. Investing in critical infrastructure;\n\nc. Strengthening security and ensuring good governance;\n\nd. Enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace;\n\ne. Reducing poverty; and\n\nf. Minimizing regional, economic and social disparities.\n\n35. The 2022 Appropriation therefore is a Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability.\n\n36. Defence and internal security will continue to be our top priority. We remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\n\n37. The 2022 budget is also the first in our history, where MDAs were clearly advised on gender responsive budgeting. These are part of critical steps in our efforts to distribute resources fairly and reach vulnerable groups of our society.\n\nPARAMETERS AND FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS\n\n38. Distinguished Members of the National Assembly, the 2022 to 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper sets out the parameters for the 2022 Budget as follows:\n\na. Conservative oil price benchmark of 57 US Dollars per barrel;\n\nb. Daily oil production estimate of 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day);\n\nc. Exchange rate of four 410.15 per US Dollar; and\n\nd. Projected GDP growth rate of 4.2 percent and 13 percent inflation rate.\n\n2022 REVENUE ESTIMATES\n\n39. Based on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally-collectible revenue is estimated at 17.70 trillion Naira in 2022.\n\n40. Total federally distributable revenue is estimated at 12.72 trillion Naira in 2022 while total revenue available to fund the 2022 Federal Budget is estimated at 10.13 trillion Naira. This includes Grants and Aid of 63.38 billion Naira, as well as the revenues of 63 Government-Owned Enterprises.\n\n41. Oil revenue is projected at 3.16 trillion, Non-oil taxes are estimated at 2.13 trillion Naira and FGN Independent revenues are projected to be 1.82 trillion Naira.\n\nPLANNED 2022 EXPENDITURE\n\n42. A total expenditure of sixteen point three-nine (16.39) trillion Naira is proposed for the Federal Government in 2022. The proposed expenditure comprises:\n\na. Statutory Transfers of 768.28 billion Naira;\n\nb. Non-debt Recurrent Costs of 6.83 trillion;\n\nc. Personnel Costs of 4.11 trillion Naira;\n\nd. Pensions, Gratuities and Retirees\u2019 Benefits 577.0 billion Naira;\n\ne. Overheads of 792.39 billion Naira;\n\nf. Capital Expenditure of 5.35 trillion Naira, including the capital component of Statutory Transfers;\n\ng. Debt Service of 3.61 trillion Naira; and\n\nh. Sinking Fund of 292.71 billion Naira to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nFiscal Balance\n\n43. We expect the total fiscal operations of the Federal Government to result in a deficit of 6.26 trillion Naira. This represents 3.39 percent of estimated GDP, slightly above the 3 percent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. Countries around the world have to of necessity over-shoot their fiscal thresholds for the economies to survive and thrive\n\n44. We need to exceed this threshold considering our collective desire to continue tackling the existential security challenges facing our country.\n\n45. We plan to finance the deficit mainly by new borrowings totalling 5.01 trillion Naira, 90.73 billion Naira from Privatization Proceeds and 1.16 trillion Naira drawdowns on loans secured for specific development projects.\n\n46. Some have expressed concern over our resort to borrowing to finance our fiscal gaps. They are right to be concerned. However, we believe that the debt level of the Federal Government is still within sustainable limits. Borrowings are to specific strategic projects and can be verified publicly.\n\n47. As you are aware, we have witnessed two economic recessions within the period of this Administration. In both cases, we had to spend our way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt.\n\n48. Our target over the medium term is to grow our Revenue-to-GDP ratio from about 8 percent currently to 15 percent by 2025. At that level of revenues, the Debt-Service-to-Revenue ratio will cease to be worrying. Put simply, we do not have a debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge which we are determined to tackle to ensure our debts remain sustainable.\n\n49. Very importantly, we have endeavoured to use the loans to finance critical development projects and programmes aimed at improving our economic environment and ensuring effective delivery of public services to our people. We focused on;\n\na. the completion of major road and rail projects;\n\nb. the effective implementation of Power sector projects;\n\nc. the provision of potable water;\n\nd. construction of irrigation infrastructure and dams across the country; and\n\ne. critical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading Primary Health Care Centres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nInnovations in Infrastructure Financing\n\n50. In 2022, Government will further strengthen the frameworks for concessions and public private partnerships (PPPs). Capital projects that are good candidates for PPP by their nature will be developed for private sector participation.\n\n51. We will also explore available opportunities in the existing ecosystem of green finance including the implementation of our Sovereign Green Bond Programme and leveraging debt-for-climate swap mechanisms.\n\nEnhancing Revenue Mobilisation\n\n52. Our strategies to improve revenue mobilisation will be sustained in 2022 with the goal of achieving the following objectives:\n\na. Enhance tax and excise revenues through policy reforms and tax administration measures;\n\nb. Review the policy effectiveness of tax waivers and concessions;\n\nc. Boost customs revenue through the e-Customs and Single Window initiatives; and\n\nd. Safeguard revenues from the oil and gas sector.\n\n53. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, I commend you for the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021. It is my hope that the implementation of the law will boost confidence in our economy and attract substantial investments in the sector.\n\nFinance Bill 2022\n\n54. In line with our plan to accompany annual budgets with Finance Bills, partly to support the realization of fiscal projections, current tax and fiscal laws are being reviewed to produce a draft Finance Bill 2022.\n\n55. It is our intention that once ongoing consultations are completed, the Finance Bill would be submitted to the National Assembly to be considered alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n56. Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Distinguished and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, this speech would be incomplete without commending the immense, patriotic, and collaborative support of the National Assembly in the effort to deliver socio-economic development and democracy dividends for our people.\n\n57. I wish to assure you of the strong commitment of the Executive to strengthen the relationship with the National Assembly.\n\n58. Nigeria is currently emerging from a very difficult economic challenge. We must continue to cooperate and ensure that our actions are aimed at accelerating the pace of economic recovery so that we can achieve economic prosperity and deliver on our promises to the Nigerian people.\n\n59. The fiscal year 2022 is very crucial in our efforts to ensure that critical projects are completed, put to use and improve the general living conditions of our people.\n\n60. It is with great pleasure therefore, that I lay before this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly, the 2022 Budget Proposals of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n61. I thank you most sincerely for your attention.\n\n62. May God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

Not only can youngsters sometimes get seriously ill, but keeping them in school can be a challenge with the coronavirus still raging in poorly vaccinated communities.\n\nPfizer announced in a tweet that it had formally filed its application with the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nNow the FDA will have to decide if there\u2019s enough evidence that the shots are safe and will work for younger children like they do for teens and adults. An independent expert panel will publicly debate the evidence on Oct. 26.\n\nOne big change: Pfizer says its research shows the younger kids should get a third of the dose now given to everyone else. After their second dose, the 5- to 11-year-olds developed virus-fighting antibody levels just as strong as teens and young adults get from regular-strength shots.\n\nWhile kids are at lower risk of severe illness or death than older people, COVID-19 does sometimes kill children and cases in youngsters have skyrocketed as the extra-contagious delta variant has swept through the country\n\n\u201cIt makes me very happy that I am helping other kids get the vaccine,\u201d said Sebastian Prybol, 8, of Raleigh, North Carolina. He is enrolled in Pfizer\u2019s study at Duke University and doesn\u2019t yet know if he received the vaccine or dummy shots.\n\n\u201cWe do want to make sure that it is absolutely safe for them,\u201d said Sebastian\u2019s mother, Britni Prybol. But she said she will be \u201coverjoyed\u201d if the FDA clears the vaccine.\n\nPfizer studied the lower dose in 2,268 volunteers ages 5 to 11, and has said there were no serious side effects. The study isn\u2019t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after the second dose of the regular-strength vaccine, mostly in young men.\n\nIf the FDA authorizes emergency use of the kid-sized doses, there\u2019s another hurdle before vaccinations in this age group can begin. Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will decide whether to recommend the shots for youngsters, and the CDC will make a final decision.",
