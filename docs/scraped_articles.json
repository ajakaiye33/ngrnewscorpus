          "text": "Ibrahim Salami, one of the Cotonou, Benin Republic-based lawyers of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, has said the activist can not be extradited to Nigeria by any legal means.\n\nHe explained that there was no accord between Nigeria and Benin Republic that can give room for extradition.\n\nThe lawyer said Igboho can only be extradited by political arrangement, which according to him, is dangerous for his safety.\n\nThe law professor, in an interview with BBC Yoruba, also said his client may be released tomorrow (Monday).\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the Beninese court adjourned Igboho\u2019s case till Monday after his five lawyers failed to convince the prosecutor that he had no case to answer.\n\nThe Beninese authorities have, however, released Ropo, the agitator\u2019s wife, who was arrested with the 48-year-old activist on Monday, July 19, 2021, by the International Criminal Police Organisation at the Cadj\u00e8houn Airport in Cotonou, Republic of Benin on their way to Germany.\n\nOn his part, Igboho was returned to police custody.\n\nThe lawyers had said that during the hearing, prosecutors claimed Igboho was on a watchlist for alleged trafficking in arms, inciting violence that could result in social disturbance and causing disunity in Nigeria.\n\nWhile urging Igboho\u2019s supporters to stay away from the court proceedings on Monday, the lawyer assured them that the legal team will fight harder to ensure his freedom.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen we went to court on Thursday, we had a large turnout of Igbho\u2019s supporters. I frowned at their action. They should stay at home and let us do our job. Igboho is accused of causing disorderliness and civil unrest. If they are now mobilising to court, it may send a wrong signal. They should support him with prayers from home.\n\n\u201cThere is no accord between Nigeria and Benin that allows Benin to extradite Igboho to Nigeria. He can only be extradited on political grounds. In that regard, the law won\u2019t apply.\n\n\u201cIt is important that Igboho is not extradited to Nigeria under any circumstances. It is better for him to die here in Benin than be extradited to Nigeria.\u201d",

O Mbadiwe University.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that it was the unveiling of the white paper reports on lands that heightened insecurity in the state. We won\u2019t go back in carrying out the report on the white paper.\n\n\u201cBecause we want to restore sanity in governance, we have made frantic efforts to deliver to our campaign promises anchored on Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Recovery.\n\n\u201cAnyone found wanton in the area of stealing or embezzling the people money, will be shown the way out.\n\n\u201cNote that as I recover Imo properties converted to personal ownership by those who have political power, back to Imo people, the same awaits me when I leave office. This is why I want to reiterate before that I did not become governor to be richer than the state after my tenure, but to serve you in truth and with fear of God,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the stakeholders that attended the meeting are the President of Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor; Elderstatesman Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu; former Governor of Imo State, Ikedi Ohakim; Senator representing Imo North senatorial district, Frank Ibezim; Chike Okafor who is representing Okigwe South Federal Constituency; former presidential candidate of APGA, Jerry Chukwueke.

          "text": "\u2022Nigeria hasn\u2019t requested for activist\u2019s extradition, says Beninoise lawyer\n\n\u2022Faults claim of agitator\u2019s arrest with Beninoise passport\n\nBy Gboyega Akinsanmi and Segun James\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday disclosed that contrary to the impression that the South-west governors were silent on the arrest and detention of the Yoruba Nation\u2019s activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a Sunday Igboho) by the authorities of the Republic of Benin, \u2018people\u2019 were working silently on the travails of the self-determination agitator.\n\nAlso, contrary to reports that the federal government was seeking the extradition of Igboho to Nigeria, one of his Beninoise lawyers, Prof. Ibrahim Salami, yesterday revealed that the Nigerian government has not requested his extradition from the Francophone country.\n\nThe professor of law at a university in the Republic of Benin also faulted claims that security operatives arrested Igboho alongside his wife, Ropo at the Cardinal Bernardin Gantin International Airport, Cotonou, with the passport of Benin Republic.\n\nAddressing journalists yesterday at the Polling Unit 019 Ward 08, Ikoyi II, where he cast his vote during the Lagos State Local Government/Council Areas elections, Sanwo-Olu disclosed that \u201cpeople are working behind the scenes concerning the apprehension and prosecution of Igboho at the Republic of Benin.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu was asked to respond to the alleged presumed silence of South-west governors on the arrest of Igboho.\n\nIn his response, he said: \u201cThese are very difficult times for all of us. I can assure you that people are working behind the scenes. On occasions like this, it is not by how many press people you call.\n\n\u201cI am aware that a lot of people have responses that they are doing quietly and privately. It does not have to be a public conversation,\u201d he explained.\n\nNigeria Hasn\u2019t Requested for activist\u2019s Extradition, Says Beninoise Lawyer\n\nMeanwhile, contrary to reports that the federal government was seeking the extradition of Igboho to Nigeria, one of his Beninoise lawyers, Salami has revealed that the Nigerian government has not requested his extradition from the Francophone country.\n\nSpeaking yesterday in an interview with BBC Yoruba Service, Salami disclosed that the Nigerian government only brought allegations of arms trafficking, inciting people to disintegrate Nigeria and fuelling social unrest in some parts of the federation, against Igboho.\n\nSalami disclosed that Nigeria had not formally made any request for the extradition of Igboho from the Republic of Benin to Nigeria based on the documents filed before the Cotonou Court of Appeal.\n\nHe acknowledged that the Nigerian government wrote Benin Republic that Igboho was on the wanted list and that the embattled agitator for the Yoruba Nation should be detained if found within the territorial jurisdiction of the Francophone country.\n\nThe lawyer explained that the authorities of Benin Republic did not apprehend Igboho because he violated the Constitution of Benin Republic or any law of the Francophone country.\n\nRather, according to him, Nigeria claimed that Igboho violated its domestic laws at home.\n\n\u201cIgboho did not violate any law in the Benin Republic. We are not afraid of that,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said before the Republic of Benin could release Igboho to the Nigerian government, the Federal Republic of Nigeria had to prove before the court of competent jurisdiction in the Francophone country that he violated Nigerian laws as claimed.\n\nFor now, Salami said: \u201cNigeria has not been able to prove that Igboho violated its domestic laws. But we do not want a situation where the Republic of Benin will keep him for a long time and allow Nigeria to file additional documents before the court.\n\n\u201cBased on court documents, there are currently three allegations that Nigeria brought against Igboho at the Cotonou Court Appeal. First, Nigeria accused him of arms trafficking. We are surprised to learn of this allegation.\n\n\u201cSecond, Nigeria claimed that Igboho was fuelling social unrest in Nigeria or inciting people to cause conflict in Nigeria. Third, Nigeria alleged that Igboho wanted to disintegrate Nigeria. We, Igboho\u2019s lawyers, fought hard against these allegations.\n\n\u201cWe established before the court that Igboho was a pacifist and that he exercised his right without using any arm or ammunition. Yoruba people worldwide must not allow Benin Republic to extradite Igboho to Nigeria because his life is under threat.\u201d\n\nSalami deflated claims that the agitator for the Yoruba Nation was arrested with the passports of Benin Republic and Germany, noting that the claims \u201care false and untrue.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer explained how Igboho left Nigeria after the operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) invaded his Ibadan residence, killing two of his supporters and destroying property worth millions of Naira.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen Sunday Igboho left Nigeria, he escaped through an illegal route because his life was under threat. He left Nigeria alongside his wife with the plan to travel to Germany because his wife and seven children are living in Germany.\n\n\u201cWhen he arrived at Benin Airport, security operatives stopped him because the Federal Government of Nigeria claimed that he was on its wanted list. They did not arrest Igboho because he violated the laws of the Republic of Benin.\n\n\u201cNo, Igboho did not violate any law in the Republic of Benin. Security operatives did not also arrest him with the passport of the Republic of Benin. It is a lie that Igboho was arrested with the passport of the Benin Republic. Rather, he was arrested because Nigeria claimed Igboho violated its domestic law,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, when Igboho was arrested at the Cardinal Bernadin International Airport, the security operatives of Benin Republic found a Nigerian passport with him and not the passport of the Francophone country as widely reported.\n\nInside Igboho\u2019s Nigerian passport, according to Igboho\u2019s lawyer, security operatives also found a German Residency Permit.\n\n\u201cThere is no visa. Indeed, he does not need a visa to travel to Germany along with his wife because they have residency permits.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that security operatives did not harass the embattled activist, Salami lamented that Igboho was detained with his hands handcuffed, which he said, violated the standard practice in Benin Republic.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen we visited Sunday Igboho in the police station, he was not abused or harassed. Security operatives did not put leg cuffs on Igboho\u2019s ankles. But the police did something wrong. They handcuffed him while he was in detention.\n\n\u201cTo eat and visit convenience was a big challenge to him. As a result, Igboho relied on people before he could eat or visit the toilet. That is against human rights. We brought the attention of the police and prosecutor to Igboho\u2019s condition in detention.\n\n\u201cDespite bringing this violation to their attention, the police authorities in Benin Republic have not removed handcuffs from Igboho\u2019s hands. That is not right by all standards. However, they did not harass him; neither did they put him in legcuffs.\u201d\n\nOyebade, Abbas Explain Benin\u2019s Obligation to Protect Igboho\n\nIn a related development, Nigeria\u2019s foremost scholar of jurisprudence and international law, Prof. Akin Oyebode has explained different conditions under international conventions and treaties extradition requests could be granted, though claimed that granting extradition requests is more political than legal.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY on Igboho\u2019s case, Oyebode explained that the ball \u201cis clearly in the court of the Republic of Benin. The Republic of Benin might insist that the crime for which Igboho is being sought must be established prima facie in the court of Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nUnder international law, Oyebode clarified that seeking self-determination was not a crime, noting that the Republic of Benin Republic \u201chas obligation to reject Nigeria\u2019s extradition request if there is any currently before the Francophone country.\n\n\u201cDo not forget the Republic of Benin has a substantial Yoruba population. Igboho will enjoy sympathy from the government and people of Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nThe law professor, however, observed that the only problem Igboho might encounter was that there \u201cis an old quadripartite agreement involving Benin Republic, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo. That is the 1984 Extradition Treaty,\u201d which placed an obligation on the Francophone country to extradite the embattled agitator.\n\nExcept for the conditions that regulate extradition, Oyebode said: \u201cIt should be simple to extradite him. Also, Nigeria has soiled its hands due to attacks on Igboho\u2019s friends, family members, and Ibadan residence.\n\n\u201cTwo of those living were said to have been killed. That shows Nigeria acted Gestapo. And that might becloud Nigeria\u2019s request to extradite Igboho. He who comes to equity must come with clean hands.\n\n\u201cIf Benin Republic does not believe justice can be done in terms of rule of law, the presumption of innocence or fair hearing, they might refuse to surrender him.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing Nigeria can do about it. If the Republic of Benin believes Igboho is a political fugitive, it might refuse to surrender. In international law, refusal to surrender a fugitive is tantamount to granting asylum.\n\n\u201cIn other words, If the Republic of Benin grants him asylum, that puts an end to the whole matter. By implication, Igboho becomes a political refugee and has the right to live in the Republic of Benin,\u201d the law professor explained.\n\nAlso, putting conditions for extraditing a fugitive in perspective, another scholar of International Law, Prof. Ademola Abbas has explained the diverse laid-down rules and conditions under which a fugitive could be extradited to his country of nationality, saying those conditions should be fulfilled before a country could grant an extradition request.\n\nHe said one of such conditions \u201cis that a surrendering country can only repatriate somebody from territory if he has committed a crime in the requesting country.\n\n\u201cThat crime cannot be a political crime and that if you repatriate them, he will not suffer discrimination and he will be guaranteed justice wherever you are repatriating to. There is a treaty obligation between Nigeria and Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cHowever, the salient question will be: has Sunday Igboho committed a crime in Nigeria? Will he be able to get justice in Nigeria? Or will he face discrimination? Will his trial be political? Those are critical questions that the Benin Republic must answer.\n\n\u201cThe Republic of Benin, being an ECOWAS member, has those obligations under the ECOWAS Treaty, under African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. There are many international conventions that Nigeria and Benin Republic are signatory to.\n\n\u201cEven though there is a treaty between the two countries, that treaty itself does not take your other obligations away. In the instance of the 1994 ECOWAS Treaty, repatriation cannot only take place where there is due process.\n\n\u201cThey must have subjected Sunday Igboho to due process of the Benin Republic. The court must be satisfied that if Sunday Igboho is repatriated to Nigeria, he will not face political trial and he will be guaranteed justice,\u201d Abbas explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Al-Makura, Akume, Abdullahi\u2019s camps want party to conduct election\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Governor Mai Mala Buni-led National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may face fresh challenges following the committee\u2019s recent revelation that the party would favour consensus option for the election of its officials at all levels to reduce acrimony, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the political camps of the two former Governors of Nasarawa State, Mr. Umaru Tanko Al-Makura; Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and their counterpart from Benue State, Senator George Akume have insisted that the party should conduct the election for the emergence of its national chairman.\n\nAl-Makura, Adamu, and Akume are the leading contenders for the position of the national chairman of the ruling party.\n\nThe National Secretary of the Buni-led APC committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, had reportedly stated that the party was recommending the consensus option for the election of its officials at all levels to reduce acrimony.\n\nReacting to agitations by some state chapters of the party to have what they described as a proper election, Akpanudoedehe had explained that the party leadership was dealing with the issue of integrating incoming and already established members as well as accommodating their various interests.\n\n\u201cWe have more and more governors from opposition political parties, especially the PDP, who are coming to join us with thousands of their supporters; we have to make room for them.\n\n\u201cWhile doing so, we don\u2019t want to take steps to push out those who are already within.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging states to adopt the consensus arrangement because it saves costs and reduces acrimony. That is why when you look at Article 20 of our constitution which talks about elections, the first thing there is for members to try reaching a consensus. When that fails, then you go to cast ballots,\u201d he had reportedly said.\n\nThe ruling party had promised to shock the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by adopting consensus to elect its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election.\n\nBut the political camps of Al-Makura, Adamu, and Akume, who feared that the party would also apply the same consensus option to elect its national chairman, have expressed their opposition to the option of a consensus national chairman.\n\nOne of the campaign managers of Al-Makura, who is a member of the House of Representatives, told THISDAY that the option of a consensus national chairman would not be acceptable to his principal.\n\nHe explained that consensus arrangement is a ploy by those who are afraid of election to impose a national chairman on the party.\n\n\u201cThis is democracy. Let us go to the convention and let a popular candidate win. An election is all about winners and losers. You can\u2019t win all the time.\n\n\u201cThe winner will always do the needful by commencing reconciliation processes after his victory. But to impose a candidate as a consensus option will be resisted,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking in the same manner, one of the campaign managers of Adamu also told THISDAY that the idea of a consensus in the election of the APC national chairman of the APC would defeat the idea of freedom of choice that defines democracy.\n\nHe said that the consensus option advocated by the national secretary of APC was nothing but a smokescreen to impose unpopular persons as members of the ruling party, insisting that, \u201cif you are popular, please come out and contest as we are ready to oppose this idea of a consensus.\u201d\n\nAlso, an official of Akume\u2019s camp told THISDAY that the Minister of Special Duties would only accept proper election.\n\nHe said that \u201cto do otherwise is to invite crisis for anyone so appointed as a consensus national chairman.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe PDP in all its troubles conducted an elective national convention that eventually produced Prince Uche Secondus\u201d, and wondered what the ruling party is planning to avoid.\n\nMeanwhile, a group that called itself APC stakeholders has objected to the idea of having a former governor as the national chairman of the party, explaining that former governors are not good managers of men.\n\nAccording to the group, former governors approached party administrations with arrogance and impunity that affected the smooth running of the administration of political parties.\n\nIt cautioned the party against allowing any of the former governors to emerge as the national chairman of the party.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their meeting, which was signed by Musa Musawa and Adamu Kaguru and Wahab Omolori, the APC stakeholders cautioned against allowing a former governor to emerge as national chairman.\n\nThe group argued that ex-governors tend to behave as if they still have executive powers.\n\n\u201cWe know what led to the formation of the Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee. We know also what the party was about to face before the intervention. Let us be guided before making another mistake.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing against the former governors as members of the APC but we are worried about the modus operandi in running of political parties. They tend to behave as if they are still executive governors.\n\n\u201cThey brook no opposing view; the APC cannot survive their type of leadership in a post-Muhammadu Buhari era.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Again, CBN Guarantees Safety, Resilience of Banking Industry",
          "text": "James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday reiterated the resilience, safety, and soundness of Nigerian Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) as well as the other financial institutions under its supervision.\n\nThe assurance came against the backdrop of \u201cfalse and unfounded stories circulating in the social media attacking the soundness and safety of some Nigerian banks\u201d.\n\nHowever, the CBN\u2019s acting Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, told journalists that the banking system had proven to be sturdy, despite the global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said routine bank examinations and stress tests for financial institutions operating in the country indicated that no bank licensed by the CBN is currently under any form of financial distress.\n\nNwanisobi, who spoke ahead of the next week\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of the apex bank, further stressed that the banks had adequate capital to absorb unexpected losses that may arise.\n\nHe pointed out that the central bank had continued to monitor the activities of banks to ensure that no individual or institution breached the laid down guidelines in line with the bank\u2019s resolve to ensure adherence to prudential standards.\n\nWhile also calling on the banking public to disregard any report alleging insolvency in the Nigerian banking sector, the CBN director reiterated the desire of the bank to prioritise financial inclusion as a measured approach to increase the number of adults included in financial services provided by banks in the country.\n\nNwanisobi further urged the banking public to take advantage of the services provided by the banks, particularly the intervention programmes initiated by the CBN, to enhance their economic status and contribute to overall national development.\n\nThe apex bank had severally reassured the banking public about the soundness and safety of the financial system.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, recently emphasised the resilience of the banking sector amidst the impact of the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me say that the Nigerian banking system remains very strong and resilient.

As of June 2020, NPLs have dropped to 6.41 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe capital adequacy ratio, which is a ratio that measures the size of capital that banks deployed into real assets, as of June 2019, was 15.2 per cent, but as of June 2020, it has just remained flat at 15 per cent.\n\n\u201cFor liquidity ratio, by August 2019, it was 48 per cent but as of June 2020, liquidity ratio had dropped to 37 per cent. Yes, the liquidity ratio has dropped and I will say understandably so because, for instance, you will note that from around July 2019 to June 2020, gross loans and advances into the economy as a result of the CBN\u2019s loan to deposit ratio had increased by N3.33 trillion from N15.6 trillion from June 2019 to N18.9 trillion as at June 2020.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said these loans were advanced to some of the productive sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the manufacturing sector received N315 billion, retail and consumer loan sector received N615 billion, the agricultural sector received N255 billion, general cotton received N221 billion, and information and communication technology received N206 billion.\u201d\n\nAccording to Emefiele: \u201cWhat we are saying is that despite this large sums granted in a year from N15.6 trillion to N18.9 trillion, the prudential ratio still looks so strong; this is a clear indication that the Nigerian economy and the banking system remain very strong and resilient and able to support the economic development of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "BBNaija Returns with a Jaw-dropping Colourful House",
          "text": "By Vanessa Obioha\n\nDespite a technical glitch that delayed the launch show of the sixth season of the Big Brother Naija show, the popular reality TV show still kicked off on a colourful note.\n\nThe Big Brother House which is a main feature of the show dominated conversations on social media for its spectacular decor. Since the return of the BBNaija house to Nigeria in 2019, the multi-purpose facility has gone through several modifications and this season happens to be the biggest yet with a brand new mezzanine floor added to the structure, measuring over 200sqm. This is in addition to the original house, which measures about 1800sqm with an additional 250sqm for support building services such as the presenter and artistes\u2019 lounges and an art room where all the props for the arena games are made.\n\nFor this season, the organisers MultiChoice Nigeria played with colours. From the red and blue bedrooms to the lounge draped with colourful sofas, walls adorned with geometric shapes with an accent of African d\u00e9cor pieces and the new \u2018eye-catching\u2019 door. The Head of House room which is on the mezzanine floor spotted a new look. Measuring over 50sqm, The Victorian-themed room features a gold headboard above the king-sized bed complete with embroidered maroon throw pillows and a vanity table against a wall with gold detailing. The Diary room where Big Brother gets all the juicy details from housemates comes in a dark hue with the chair being the only sparkling element in the room while the HoH chair has a gold lion statue at the foot The kitchen, another popular spot in the house also shares in the opulence with greenery and colourful cabinets.\n\nNew additions to the house include the private Executive Lounge which looks like a rainforest with the green tufted upholstery and matching green walls. For the first time, the house features an indoor games lounge with a trophy cabinet. The outdoor area also features a redesigned patio with a mural painting and jacuzzi. All pieces in the house were locally sourced with close to 75 artisans working to bring this season\u2019s theme to life.\n\nThe addition of the new floor has ultimately seen an increase in the number of cameras in the house. In the BBNaija Pepper Dem edition in 2019, the house was designed to take seven hand-held cameras and 32 que ball cameras. This season now has 14 hand-held cameras and 37 que ball cameras capable of seeing the housemates at all times. The mezzanine floor alone has 11 of those que balls and two hand-held cameras. There are also two times more ambience microphones to capture every conversation in the house.\n\n\u201cA lot goes into the production of BBNaija. We ensure that each season we deliver a great show and this includes the look and feel of the house, which is an integral part of the show,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer of MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe.\n\nThe first launch show also featured a music performance by Ladipoe.\n\nBilled for two nights this weekend, the launch show saw 11 male housemates enter the house on Saturday night. The female housemates will access the house this evening.\n\nThe sixth season themed \u2018Shine Ya Eye\u2019 is the second time the show is holding in a pandemic era. Thus, like last year, no visitors will be allowed in the house, in adherence to Covid-19 guidelines.\n\nThe grand prize for the season is N90 million with abeg as the headline sponsor.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN regulations holding back mobile money revolution in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Ghana, it would be an \u201canomaly\u201d for a supermarket, small store, or business merchant to not use a mobile money service for transactions. Daniel, a colleague at TechCabal, who visited Ghana two weeks ago said the same during a recent meeting.\n\nMobile money was first introduced in Ghana in 2009. However, it took some time for it to gain traction due to a restrictive Branchless Banking policy of the Bank of Ghana.\n\nNew agent and electronic money guidelines were released in 2014, allowing network operators to run mobile money services, with supervision from the banking regulator.\n\nEver since, players such as MTN have invested heavily in mobile money operations with great success. The telco giant launched its MoMo service in January 2017. By January 2019, over 100,000 merchants were using the service.\n\nUptake in mobile money services and financial inclusion have equally increased across the country. A March 2020 Summary of Economic and Financial Data published by the Bank of Ghana showed that the country had 14.7 million active mobile money accounts and 235,000 active agents.\n\nOn the other end of the cardinal point is M-Pesa\u2019s success in East African countries, particularly Kenya. The mobile money service, owned and operated by telco Safaricom, has significantly contributed to improving the financial inclusion rate in Nairobi.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government is banking on a mobile money service run by the state-owned network operator, Ethio Telecom, to increase financial inclusion among low-income groups. The service soared to more than 1 million registered users in one week, 4 million in a month, and 6 million in two months.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers when it comes to penetration.\n\nChasing financial inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion for 200 million Nigerians has been a much-touted priority of Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and the central bank under governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s leadership. Still, it\u2019s a goal that has been elusive.\n\nNigeria has a significantly large population without access to financial services. In 2017, it was home to 3.4% of the world\u2019s unbanked people despite contributing 2.6% to the global population.\n\nSome progress has been made over the past decade to bring more Nigerians under the formal financial system, according to a report by EFinA, but the figures remain disturbing.\n\nAt the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked as the central bank missed out on its 80% national financial inclusion target. In addition, just over 40 million out of an estimated 105.5 million Nigerian adults have bank verification numbers (BVN), an important metric for gauging how many people have access to financial services.\n\nThe CBN has adopted several measures \u2013 such as the creation of special Payment Services Banks (PSBs) in 2018 \u2013 to drive financial inclusion.\n\nHowever, the apex bank has shown reluctance towards adopting a framework that has proved to be very effective in improving financial inclusion in many African countries: telecoms-driven mobile money services.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPayment service banks, not mobile money operators\n\nIn 2018, CBN announced a new regime that would allow non-financial companies to apply for mobile banking licences \u2013 either as PSBs or Mobile Money Operators (MMOs).\n\nUnder the guidelines, mobile network operators are allowed to provide financial services to millions of unbanked Nigerians. However, they can do so only as payment service banks and through a subsidiary separate from their core operations.\n\nPayment service banks are like small-scale banks. While they\u2019re similar to typical banks, the scope of their license is strictly to deepen financial inclusion and the regulator forbids them from engaging in credit risk and foreign exchange operations.\n\nMore than two years after the CBN\u2019s announcement, just three companies (including mobile operators 9mobile and Globacom) have been granted PSB licences. The two other network companies in the country, MTN and Airtel, are yet to get a regulatory nod to launch their Payment Service Banks. Although the former launched an agent network for money transfers in 2019.\n\nThe lack of progress on licences \u2013 particularly for two telcos that have significant mobile money experience in other markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 calls into question how dedicated the central bank is to really broaden access to financial services in the country.\n\nSome industry stakeholders blame the issue on lobbying by traditional financial institutions said to be wary of telco-led mobile money services. Banks perceive that network operators would claim their territory if allowed to offer standalone financial services.\n\nAccording to one telecom industry expert who asked not to be named, the \u201cbig banks are fighting back behind the scenes to ensure telcos don\u2019t come to have their lunch.\u201d\n\nWill telcos ever lead?\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile money landscape is dominated by banks, technology, and financial services companies. Contrary to what is seen in Kenya and Ghana, telecoms operators are not allowed to apply directly for mobile money licences and are instead restricted to the provision of network infrastructure for the use of mobile money operators.\n\nThe regulatory framework is one of the core reasons why mobile money uptake has been relatively slow in Nigeria. As of 2019, there were just over 15 million mobile money accounts in the country, compared to nearly 60 million in Kenya, which is home to fewer than 55 million people.\n\nFintech companies have recorded significant strides towards advancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. Companies such as Paga and Teamapt democratise access to financial services through their agent networks and mobile payments infrastructure.\n\nBut telecoms companies are more positioned to deepen mobile money services due to their subscriber numbers, available infrastructure, and broader agent networks, which outnumber those of banks and fintechs. MTN and Airtel agents can be seen selling recharge cards in nearly every corner of the country.\n\n\u201cThe telecoms industry has ready infrastructure and resources to push financial inclusion all over the country. If you truly want to deepen the use of mobile technology for financial service, the last mile to reach the people is through network operators,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThere have been calls for a more liberalised regulatory framework where telcos lead. However, if the CBN\u2019s latest mobile money regulatory framework published July 9 is anything to go by, network operators will continue to play the second fiddle in Nigeria\u2019s mobile money space under the current administration.\n\nIn the new framework, the banking regulator reiterates its long-held stance that Nigeria will not adopt the model in which telecommunications companies are the drivers of mobile money services.\n\n\u201cThe CBN recognises the importance of Mobile Network Operators in the operations of mobile money services and appreciates the criticality of the infrastructure they provide. However, the telco-led model (where the lead initiator is an MNO) shall not be operational in Nigeria,\u201d the 40-page document reads.\n\nThe framework stated only two acceptable models for the implementation of mobile money services: bank-led (bank and/or its consortium as lead initiator) and non-bank-led (a corporate organisation duly licensed by the CBN as lead initiator).\n\nAlthough the CBN says it recognises the importance of telecoms companies in providing the infrastructure to drive the exchange of messages for mobile payments, it feels compelled to prohibit the Telco-led option. This, according to the bank, is to \u201cretain full control of monetary policy operations, minimise risks and ensure that the offering of financial services is driven by organisations that have been licensed to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to meet its 2020 target, the CBN has revised its financial inclusion goal to 95% by 2024. But with its continued regulatory conservatism towards telecoms-led mobile money, the regulator is likely to find it only more difficult to bring millions of unbanked Nigerians into the financial system.\n\n\u201cCBN\u2019s models will only slow down financial inclusion penetration,\u201d the expert said. \u201cInstead, telecoms companies should be allowed to take the lead in the mobile money space as seen in other African countries. This is the only way speedy coverage and easy access can be achieved and financial inclusion improved.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed that it\u2019ll launch the pilot scheme of its digital currency on October 1, 2021.\n\nAccording to TheCable, CBN revealed this during a private webinar with stakeholders on Thursday, July 22, 2021.\n\nThe apex bank announced earlier on June 10, 2021, that it would launch a pilot scheme for its digital currency before the end of the year.\n\nRakiya Mohammed, CBN Director of Information Technology, said, \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to the populace,\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Director also revealed that the project tagged GIANT will run on the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain.\n\nHyperledger Fabric blockchain\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is a private and permissioned blockchain network designed by computer hardware company, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). The network is an open-source platform by the Linus foundation, which means several developers contributed to its code.\n\nThe blockchain network is built specifically for enterprise-grade applications. It is recommended for businesses or private entities hoping to keep transactions exclusive.\n\nSince it\u2019s a private network, the CBN decides who can enter the platform. The regulator can approve or override a transaction if it deems fit, unlike bitcoin, where transactions are approved upon the agreement of majority nodes.\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric has been criticised as not even being a blockchain network with less expensive solutions offering the same level of security.\n\nIn a Cointelegraph article on July 2, 2019, Stuart Popejoy, blockchain expert and founder of hybrid blockchain platform, Kedena, said that \u201cFabric\u2019s architecture is far more complex than any blockchain platform while also being less secure against tampering and attacks. You would think that a \u201cprivate\u201d blockchain would at least offer scalability and performance, but Fabric fails here as well. Simply put, pilots built on Fabric will face a complex and insecure deployment that won\u2019t be able to scale with their businesses.\u201d\n\nIn comparison, he says, blockchain is a decentralised and immutable platform where truth is enforced with a consensus mechanism. On a network like Bitcoin or Ethereum, a consensus is achieved through mining or Proof of Work (PoW).\n\nHowever, IBM says the network is permissioned, meaning only authorised and known participants can access it. In addition, it has a hardware security module support, vital for safeguarding and managing sensitive data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, CBN says Nigeria cannot be left behind when 80% of central banks globally are considering issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nPer Coin Insider, China pioneered the CBDC movement while other countries like Sweden, Japan, and The Bahamas are testing their digital currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website Writer and tech enthusiast\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nTwitter\u2019s shiny new downvote button\n\nConvergence\u2019 Partners\u2019 $120m round\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\nTwitter is testing out a downvote button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on Unsplash\n\nWhat happened? Micro-blogging platform, Twitter is testing a way to upvote or downvote replies as part of efforts to understand what users find relevant in a conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this work? Twitter says while the downvote button will be visible, only the reply owner can know the exact number received.\n\nFor now, it is a test for a research the company is conducting to see if the up and down voting match what it suggests as relevant replies. It is currently available to a few iOS users.\n\nHave we seen something similar? Platforms like Reddit and YouTube have a downvote and dislike button, respectively.\n\nHowever, according to Twitter, this is not a dislike button and while it bears some resemblance to Reddit\u2019s downvote button, it will not affect the order of replies. This means they will not be ranked according to the highest numbe of downvotes.\n\nWait a minute, how will this improve interaction on Twitter? Will it reduce toxic tweets? Won\u2019t this encourage trolls especially since only the recipient can see it?\n\nWell, I found Ashton Kutcher, actor and tech investor\u2019s comments on a \u201cdislike button\u201d quite interesting.\n\nPer CNET, Kutcher believes a dislike button will head off more volatile expressions of disagreement on social media platforms, giving people a simple, frictionless way to give negative feedback.\n\nI\u2019m somewhat inclined to agree but I still have some reservations. I also wonder if there might be an option to turn this feature off if you don\u2019t want it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, in May 2021, Jane Wachung Wong, an app researcher, revealed that Twitter was working on adding Facebook-like reactions \u2014 \ud83d\ude02, \ud83e\udd14, \ud83d\ude13 \u2014 to the platform.\n\nWhat is Twitter going to spring on us next? Any ideas? Let me know what you think in the comments section below.\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTanzanian shilling notes\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the necessary requirements.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means Cellulant is now one of the PSSPs supported by the Bank of Tanzania to offer digital payments solutions across the country.\n\nDo you know? Cellulant was founded in 2002 as a music streaming platform that enabled musicians to get a percentage of the money paid by fans to download their songs.\n\nThen over the years, the music streaming platform rebranded as a fintech company, offering digital payments and managing an ecosystem of retailers, merchants, banks, mobile network operators, governments, and international development partners.\n\nWith a physical presence in 18 African countries, the company boasts of offering more than 154 payment choices in 34 countries, and connecting 220 million users to a single inclusive network, enabling interoperability that has evaded multiple companies in the payments market.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant launched Trigg, a digital payments network, in Zambia, that enables companies around the country to seamlessly take payments from their customers.\n\nTrigg is said to help businesses wishing to digitise their payments to collect and make payments across many payment methods and currencies with the greatest customer experience.\n\nEdwin Kiiru, Tanzania\u2019s Cellulant Country Manager, says the approval by the BOT will enable the company to extend its payment solutions across all spectrums of Tanzania\u2019s payments ecosystem.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will allow it connect to banks, online merchants, payment processors, merchants, state governments, and customers to meet their digital payment demands in Tanzania.\n\nConvergence Partners raises $120 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African tech investment firm, Convergence Partners, has raised $120 million to drive inclusion in Africa.\n\nWho participated in the round? CDC Group the UK\u2019s development finance institution, the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Proparco \u2014 private sector arm of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD Group) \u2014 participated in the round.\n\nWhat about Convergence Partners? Founded by Andile Ngcaba, CEO, in 2006, the investment firm is focused on the Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) sector in Africa.\n\nAccording to the official website, the firm has invested in submarine cable systems, geostationary satellites, terrestrial long-haul, metro and access fibre, wireless networks, data centres, and service provision like enterprise connectivity, fintech and healthtech solutions, and data switching since its launch.\n\nIn February 2021, it acquired Ctrack, a telematics Software-as-a-Service (Saas) digital infrastructure platform that offers fleet management, insurance and weather telematic solutions and asset tracking solutions to its subscribers in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe new funding will be utilised to further digital infrastructure\u2019s emerging growth areas, particularly fibre, wireless, data centres, 5G, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), network virtualisation, and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, the funding when invested is aimed at boosting entrepreneurship, innovation, skills development, and creating jobs while increasing access to the Internet and all the critical digital tools it provides.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nTwitter may be adding voice effects to Spaces.

Open to Kenyans, Nigerians, and Ghanaians, applications began on July 19 and will close on August 2, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaming has evolved from a simple way to pass the time to one of the most profitable industries in the world.\n\nFor context: In September 2013, on launch day, Grand Theft Auto V made $800 million. According to Fast Company, this is more sales in 24 hours than any movie or musical album in history.\n\nMobile gaming: Per Business Wire, the mobile gaming market was worth $98 billion globally in 2020 and is expected to grow to $272 billion by 2030.\n\nInterestingly, people play more games on mobile than personal computers (PC) and consoles. According to Kevuru games, 59.9% of games were played on mobile in 2020, while 28.70% and 16.11% were played on PC and console, respectively.\n\nWhile nothing beats gaming on a 60\u201d, 4K display TV\u2014 at least for me \u2014 smartphones are mobile, hence their lead.\n\nTo know more about the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, check out this article\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram is giving users more control over the kind of content they consume on the app.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, the company announced in a blog post that it was launching Sensitive Content Control. The feature will help users control the content they want to see on the content discovery page, Explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Instagram is giving you the option to decide which kind of content you want to see while you scroll through the \u2018Explore\u2019 page. Not a puppy person? No more doggy pictures jumping out of your timeline.\n\nAccording to Instagram, sensitive content isn\u2019t content that breaks the rules but could upset some users.\n\nMore control: Back in May 2021, Facebook and Instagram allowed users to remove the Like count on their posts to give them more power over their experience on the apps.\n\nWhile Instagram is giving more power, YouTube wants to help creators make more money.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, YouTube announced it is rolling out a beta version of its new feature, Super Thanks.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? Well, YouTube says in its blog post that it\u2019s a way for fans to show appreciation to their favourite creators on the platform.\n\nHow does it work? While you\u2019re watching a video \u2014 live or not \u2014 you can purchase a Super Thanks that ranges between $2 to $50 to show your appreciation.\n\nYou can make payments through Google Pay, the same way you pay for apps on the Play Store.\n\nStill in beta: According to YouTube, \u201cSuper Thanks is currently in beta and with today\u2019s expansion, is now available to thousands of monetising creators. The feature is available to creators and viewers in 68 countries on desktop and mobile devices.\u201d\n\nClubhouse no longer requires an invite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dmitry Mashkin on Unsplash\n\nOn Wednesday, July 21, 2021, live-audio chat platform Clubhouse announced in a blog post that it is no longer in beta testing and the app is no longer invite-only.\n\nFor the past 16 months, Clubhouse was exclusive to invites only. Before now, you needed someone already invited to the platform with your phone number to send you an invite. Business Insider says some people even started a business out of selling invites\n\nWhile this exclusivity made it even more appealing, it was a way to control the rise in the number of app users.\n\nIn its blog, Clubhouse said the invite system was essential to its history. By adding people in waves, it has been able to \u201cgrow Clubhouse in a measured way, and (mostly \ud83d\ude2c ) keep things from breaking\u201d\n\nBreaking the barriers: The invite system wasn\u2019t the only thing that made Clubhouse exclusive. Until May 2021, it was only available to iPhone users.\n\nAs competition mounts from Twitter and Facebook, the app seems to be shedding its exclusivity to accommodate more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nDON\u2019T buy a new PC for Windows 11!

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s long journey to a consolidated democracy where there will be credible and transparent elections appears to be under threat.\n\nIt would appear that elected representatives of the people who have found themselves in leadership position at the National Assembly are putting the gavel to use in a negative way, defeating the main essence of the instrument.\n\nThe rush with which the presiding officers at the Senate and the House of Representatives chant \u201cthe \u2018ayes\u2019 have it\u201d or \u201cthe \u2018nays\u2019 have it\u201d appears to suggest that in many occasions they do not even hear correctly what is being said. Their chants and hitting of the gavel depend on what they want to achieve in any circumstance.\n\nNigeria\u2019s democracy\n\nThey always have their way, to the detriment of the entire country, as the hitting of the gavel signals the conclusion of a matter on the floor of the house.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, a gavel is a small ceremonial mallet commonly made of hardwood, typically fashioned with a handle. It can be used to call for attention or to punctuate rulings and proclamations and is a symbol of the authority and right to act officially in the capacity of a presiding officer.\n\nIt is often struck against a sound block, a striking surface typically also made of hardwood, to enhance its sound qualities.\n\nWikipedia noted that, according to tradition, Vice President John Adams used a gavel as a call to order in the first U.S. Senate in New York in the spring of 1789. Since then, it has remained customary to tap the gavel against a lectern or desk to indicate the opening and closing of proceedings and to indicate that the judge\u2019s decision is final. It is also used to keep the meeting itself calm and orderly.\n\nApart from the listed noble uses of the gavel, it would seem that the use of the instrument has been politicised in Nigeria, as presiding officers now allegedly employ it to achieve pre-determined outcome.\n\nNigeria and the world might have watched with amazement as Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives and Chairman of Committee of the Whole in the House, Ahmed Idris Wase recently hit the gavel twice to uphold the fainted voice votes of the anti-electronic transmission of election results proponents as against the thunderous votes of the pro-electronic transmission lawmakers during consideration of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nIt is believed that electronic transmission of election results and adoption of technologies in the electoral process is panacea to manipulation of polls results which has been the bane of democracy in Nigeria in the past 22 years of the country\u2019s democratic journey.\n\nRead Also: Udom wants quick passage of electoral bill to restore confidence in Nigeria\u2019s democracy\n\nCritical stakeholders, including the electoral body; the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and Development Partners have always advocated for electronic conduct of elections to check all forms of malpractices common with manual operations.\n\nThe clamour and expectations of the stakeholders and indeed Nigerians were that the recently passed Electoral Act Amendment Bill will give legal backing particularly to electronic transmission of election results and voting.\n\nHowever, the new Act in section 52 leaves the electronic transmission of election results at the mercy of INEC, which can decide when and where to transmit votes electronically or manually.\n\nSection 52 (2) of the Bill provides that: \u201cThe Commission (INEC) may adopt electronic voting or any other method of voting in any election it conducts as it may deem fit.\u201d\n\nThe Committee on Electoral Matters explained that the provision \u201cis a further amendment of the 2015 Amendment to clearly give the Commission the discretion to introduce electronic voting as may be practicable\u201d.\n\nAll was going well during the clause-by-clause consideration of the report on Electoral Bill with members proposing and adopting amendments where necessary from clause 1-51, when all of a sudden, conviviality turned into acrimony when Clause 52, section of the Bill which deals with electronic transmission of election results was read out by the Deputy Speaker who presided over the consideration.\n\nOut of the cacophony of voices calling for amendments to the clause was the Deputy Minority leader of the House, Toby Okechukwu who proposed that electronic transmission of election results be inserted and made compulsory in the Bill.\n\nOkechukwu moved that Clause 52 (2) be amended to read that: \u201cVoting and transmission of results shall be by electronic transmission\u201d.\n\nHis motion for the amendment was seconded by the Deputy Chief Whip of the House, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha (APC, Abia) and it was subjected to a voice vote by Wase.\n\nWhen it was put to voice vote, the motion received a deafening \u201cayes\u201d but Wase ruled that the shallow \u201cnays\u201d shouts had it, throwing the House into disarray with protesting lawmakers making awkward movements.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker did not hide his opposition to electronic transmission of votes when he argued that the entire country was not yet covered by broadband and as such, there would be issues with electronic transmission of results.\n\nHe wondered how electronic transmission of results would be practicable in parts of the North East where telecommunications masts have been destroyed by the Boko Haram terrorists, saying: \u201cConsider what happens to our brothers in Yobe and other places.\u201d\n\nAnother attempt by James Faleke (APC, Lagos) to at least have both the electronic and manual transmission of election results via a motion seconded by Wale Raji (APC, Lagos) was resisted by Wase who hit the gavel in favour of the \u201cnays\u201d even when it was abundantly clear that the \u201cayes\u201d had it.\n\nEfforts to divide the House for members to cast individual votes on the electronic transmission of elections results were thwarted as the leadership reverted the House to plenary and adjourned proceedings for the day.\n\nThe Green Chamber had also summoned the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to guide it on the issue of electronic transmission and NCC declared that only 50percent Polling Units across the country have 3G network that can enable such transmission.\n\nThis gave the All Progressives Congress (APC)-dominated House teeth to pass the Electoral Act Amendment Bill without explicit provision for electronic transmission of votes except for the controversial section 52(2) which makes it optional.\n\nThe House\u2019s action was without recourse to INEC which is actually the body saddled with the responsibility of conducting elections and not NCC.\n\nThe Commission had shortly after the passage of the Bill reiterated its earlier position on a National Television that it has the capacity for electronic transmission of results from remote areas of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have uploaded results from very remote areas, even from areas where you have to use human carriers to access,\u201d INEC\u2019s National Chairman and Commissioner for Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye said.\n\n\u201cSo, we have made our own position very clear, that we have the capacity and we have the will to deepen the use of technology in the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur powers are given by the constitution and the law, and we will continue to remain within the ambit and confines of the power granted to the commission by the constitution and the law,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nSolomon Bob, a member of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the House, while speaking on a Channels Television breakfast programme, Sunrise Daily, on July 21, 2021 accused Wase of rigging a voice vote conducted during the debate.\n\nBob said that after the rejection of a motion by an APC lawmaker for outright removal of electronic transmission of election results from the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, Deputy House Minority Leader Toby Okechukwu moved a counter motion to amend Section 52 of the bill to read \u201ctransmission of election results shall be done electronically,\u201d a move which sought to make it compulsory for INEC to transmit election results through electronic means.\n\nHe said that although the supporters of the motion \u2013 the \u2018ayes\u2019 \u2013 were more and as such louder than those against, the \u2018nays,\u2019 the deputy speaker ruled in favour of the \u2018nays.\u2019\n\nGiving an account of what happened, Bob said, \u201cThe trigger to the sequence of events that occurred on Thursday was an attempt by a member who moved a motion that we should not have anything at all to do with electronic transmission, which is ridiculous.\n\n\u201cHe said we should be stuck with manual transmission which was the position of the ruling APC. The motion was roundly defeated.\n\n\u201cAnother motion was moved, contrary to that earlier one moved by the APC member, that we should have it explicitly stated that results will only be by electronic transmission. Some said \u2018no\u2019 while some supported the motion. A voice vote was taken, it was against those who were against it. It was in favour of those who said it should be explicitly stated in the law that transmission will only be by electronic means.\n\n\u201cBut we also saw a capricious use of the gavel by the presiding officer \u2013 the chairman of the whole, the deputy speaker. He ruled against the \u2018ayes\u2019 even though it was clear that the \u2018ayes\u2019 had won it.\u201d\n\nThe motion was put to a second vote. The \u2018ayes\u2019 had it again but again, the deputy speaker ruled against the \u2018ayes,\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was such an extraordinary and capricious use of the gavel. A motion for division was called, he ignored it. It was an extraordinary abuse of the position of a presiding officer.\n\n\u201cBy our rules, if there is a disagreement between \u2018ayes\u2019 and \u2018nays,\u2019 you divide the House. But he refused, he practically ignored it. He denied that there was no submission at all. That was the reason behind the pandemonium in the House because a lot of things were heated up, members nearly came to fisticuffs but it was due to the audacity and the daring unlawfulness of the action taken by the man presiding and the near absence of decorum on the part of those who didn\u2019t want anything to do with electronic transmission.\u201d\n\nWhat seems to prove that Wase was deliberate in the wrong use of the gavel as he presided over the final debates on the passage of the amendment bill on the Electoral Act, was the open celebration thereafter.\n\nA letter was said to have emanated from Wase\u2019s office, celebrating the north\u2019s uncommon feat on the passage of that bill and the Petroleum Industry Bill. One of his aides, reportedly wrote to lawmakers from the north: \u201cOn behalf of the Deputy Speaker, Rt. Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase and the Northern Caucus leader, Hon. Musa Sarki Adar, I am directed to write and formally congratulate and appreciate all the northern caucuses for standing firm through their wisdom and strength to ensure the Northern interest in both PIB and Electoral Act is adequately placed in a position of advantage. There is no doubt a house united will forever get whatever it wants, giving [sic] the advantage we have in size\u2026\u201d\n\nIn March this year, while presiding over the sitting of the House, Wase had shouted down Mark Terseer Gbillah, representing Gwer East/Gwer West Federal Constituency, Benue State from presenting a petition on behalf of a group of Nigerians in the Diaspora over herdsmen\u2019s nefarious activities in Benue. Wase would not take that petition because the Nigerians who wrote and signed it were not resident in the country.\n\nThe wrong use of the gavel, which edged out electronic transmission of election results may have ruined Nigeria\u2019s democracy in no small measure as future exercise such as the 2023 general election is open to manipulations and other forms of electoral frauds experienced in the 2019 national polls and other off-season elections.\n\nThe 2019 elections were reported to have been characterised by high incidences of violence, manipulations, rigging, ballot box snatching, disruption at collation centres, vote buying and inconclusive polls which electronic means would have checked to a large extent.\n\nReports from local and international observer groups including the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), International Republican Institute (IRI) and National Democratic Institute (NDI), Civil Society Situation Room and Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) expressed serious reservations over the conduct of the 2019 general elections with regards to non-credibility.\n\nThe EU EOM\u2019s final report on the 2019 elections for instance, observed that lack of transparency and inconsistent numbers during the collation of results by INEC cast a long shadow over the integrity of the 2019 elections.\n\nThe report among others alleged that there were: \u201cnumerical discrepancies and anomalies on polling unit results forms were identified and were mostly corrected by collation officers on the spot, but without a clear system of record-keeping.\n\n\u201cInconsistent numbers during collation, lack of clear checks and explanations, and insufficient public information undermined the integrity of the elections. Similarly, there is a lack of disaggregated results by local government, ward or polling unit, which would allow for thorough checking of results\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room in its report lamented that the 2019 general elections did not meet the threshold for free, fair and credible elections.\n\nThe report indicated that:\u201dThere were differences between the number of accredited voters and the total number of votes cast in many Polling Units.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission operations fell short of its identified role.\n\nAs Idayat Hassan, director, Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), argued the prohibition of transmission of votes electronically would yield ground for the manipulation of results in future election.\n\n\u201cAs long standing election monitors, CDD West Africa, have observed the chaos associated with manual elections collating, which are \u201coften messy, incoherent and susceptible to manipulations by individuals and political parties,\u201d Hassan stated.",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s long journey to a consolidated democracy where there will be credible and transparent elections appears to be under threat.\nAccording to Wikipedia, a gavel is a small ceremonial mallet commonly made of hardwood, typically fashioned with a handle.\nHowever, the new Act in section 52 leaves the electronic transmission of election results at the mercy of INEC, which can decide when and where to transmit votes electronically or manually.\nOkechukwu moved that Clause 52 (2) be amended to read that: \u201cVoting and transmission of results shall be by electronic transmission\u201d.\nThe Deputy Speaker did not hide his opposition to electronic transmission of votes when he argued that the entire country was not yet covered by broadband and as such, there would be issues with electronic transmission of results.",

          "text": "In 2014, when Marriott International bought Protea Hotel Group, Jonah Ekpeyong, a sous-chef with Protea Hotel Oakwood Park, Lekki Lagos, was among the staff laid off by the hotel, which became self-managed.\n\nBut fortune smiled on him when a Nigerian billionaire employed him as a private chef in his sprawling home by the waterfront in Banana Island, Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\nOn settling down in the new job, Ekpeyong was usually sad on seeing two dogs, which the employer spends more than his chef salary every month to feed and maintain.\n\nAs well, there has been news in the dailies and gossip on social media of many employers who sent their house-helps to jail for misplacing or stealing their jewelry boxes, which probably are filled with gold ornaments.\n\nAt a point in 2019, two Nigerian billionaires were competing with each other on who buys the most expensive cars for their children and wives on birthdays. The social media was particularly awash with Femi Otedola\u2019s car gifts to family members on such occasions.\n\nRead also: \u2018Our objective in Nigeria is to increase our hotel portfolio by 50 percent by 2025\u2019\n\nMoreover, a visit to Legend Hotel Lagos Airport, Curio Collection by Hilton will expose you to the many private jets that take off and land almost every 30 minutes at the Quits Aviation hanger at the Lagos airport.\n\nThese are among the many elements of affluence, which many Nigerians flaunt unabashedly in a country that is officially recognised as the poverty capital of the world.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a soothsayer to tell you how poor the country is because the data is there, the suffering is obvious and the super rich are more than before rubbing their wealth on the faces of the downtrodden.\n\nIn 2020, many argued the World Bank report that revealed that Nigeria had overtaken India as the World Poverty Capital, considering that India has the most people living in extreme poverty.\n\nBut with 43 percent of Nigerians (89 million people) living below the poverty line, while another 25 percent (53 million) are vulnerable, what other evidence do one need?\n\nAccording to Fidelia Onah, a PhD Economics and consultant to African Development Bank on SMEs, poverty is looming more than forecasted in Nigeria because the government has severally refused to heed to advice.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fight poverty without creating employment. If you recognise SMEs as the engine room of economic growth, while not supporting them with favourable policies, because these are the largest employer of labour after government,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that there is so much wealth out there that needs to be redistributed as done in the developed world to reduce the poverty gap.\n\n\u201cBut who will redistribute the wealth, this government that is insensitive to the masses plight, politicians that allocate resources to themselves and family members or civil servants who are laying the conduit for government functionaries to loot funds? She wondered.\n\nThe economist, however, noted that poverty is very high in Nigeria, but not as high as being quoted by international bodies because of the lack of information on the extremely huge informal sector of the economy, which according to her, is estimated at around 60 percent more of the current GDP figures.\n\nBut the poor are also making an effort to shake hands with the rich, who rain money amid lack, hence the high level of crime in the society today.\n\n\u201cYou stay in your cozy presidential office and turn blind eye to the plights of millions of unemployed graduates, that is why youths are helping themselves with kidnapping, banditry, internet fraud with Yahoo Boys becoming bolder among other vices, and some are making fortune and crossing from Ajegunle to Banana Island,\u201d Israel Ogunu, a Port Harcourt-based psychologist and NGO administrator, lamented.\n\nHe further noted that the implication of naira rain on Nigeria in the midst of abject poverty is obvious. \u201cThe youth are on the fast lane and want it now, now. They will join any group, do anything or even risk their lives to make money and be welcomed into the moneybags\u2019 club\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cEven my little boy wants to spray money on his mother when she is dancing. Everybody needs money to live a good life and that is why we need good governance to ensure equity in wealth distribution, welfare for all and jobs to keep people positively engaged.\u201d\n\nGoing professional, the psychologist said that you cannot give a security agent a gun to safeguard money or oil well when he is poor, as he will rather use it to help himself.\n\nSame, according to him, goes for the youth.\n\n\u201cSome of those who rain money are their mates; all they need to do is find out how and where to get their own money. Fraud is quadrupling, kidnapping worse now and robbery has taken an unimaginable trend all because the youths want to escape poverty,\u201d the psychologist explained.\n\nAccording to a report by SafeYouths, a global tracker of crime committed by youths, illicit drug trafficking is still among the most thriving illegal businesses in the world today and that operators look to poor countries to recruit youths into drug trafficking because of the promise of hard currency and good life.\n\nThe report, its sixth edition, which was presented on June 26, 2021 to commemorate the United Nations\u2019 International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking 2021, revealed that poverty is pushing more youths from Africa into drug trafficking and that half of the recruits from Africa are in prisons across the world for drug trafficking.\n\nMeryline Boash, director of the platform, urged governments across the developing world, especially Africa to give priority to youth empowerment, create employment opportunities and ensure good governance to woo foreign direct investments.\n\nTo redistribute wealth, Onah thinks that the Nigerian government only needs to be sincere with governance to ensure that everything is not politics, truly offer a favourable environment to SMEs, get serious with the fight against corruption, tax the super rich more and adopt world best practice in welfare for the masses.\n\n\u201cYou cannot close the poverty gap when inflation is rising every day, when the corrupt are getting away with their loot, when youths are seeing violence as a means to quick money. You have to stop all these to close the poverty gap,\u201d she concluded.",

          "title": "Who invented Chapman?",
          "text": "There are many popular cocktails such as Tequila Sunrise, Pink Mimosa, and also Nigeria\u2019s very own Chapman cocktail, also known as the non-alcoholic punch. The Chapman is known around Nigeria and in many parts of the world and it carries fond memories for many Nigerians. On the occasion of Nigeria at 60, it is important to highlight all things that are dear to Nigerians and the Chapman is one of them.\n\nIf you live in or have visited Nigeria or most parts of the world for that matter, chances are that you have tasted a Chapman or, at the least, heard of it. You can go into any restaurant and ask for a Chapman and the bartender will know exactly what you\u2019re asking for.\n\nBut who holds the rights to this invention and recipe?\n\nThe Chapman is on almost every menu in the country and is loved by millions across Nigeria, Africa, and many parts of the world but unfortunately, like many indigenous inventions, the origin of the Chapman on the internet is overshadowed by a lot of misinformation.\n\nLike many popular dishes and cocktails, there\u2019s a longstanding debate over who actually created this cocktail. One theory that is widely believed is that the cocktail originated in Ikoyi Club, Lagos, Nigeria, and was created by a bartender at the country club who was asked to make something special for his favorite British customer named \u2018Chapman\u2019.\n\nThe beginnings\n\nBefore I go any further, let me take you out of \u2026 the mystery: The Chapman drink was not created in Ikoyi Club and it was not created for or by a Mr. Chapman. The Chapman was created by a man called Mr. Sam Alamutu who was later to become known as Apostle Samuel Alamutu of Ogun State.\n\nHe was one of the select young Nigerians to be offered a scholarship to study in the UK \u2013 as part of Awolowo\u2019s program of educating the Western region \u2013 and studied Catering and Hotel Management at the Huddersfield Polytechnic, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England before returning home in 1958. He later also obtained a Postgraduate Diploma at the Centre for Management Development, University of Cambridge, England, and became a prominent professional Hotelier.\n\nThe kindness of love and the creation of the Chapman\n\nAs a prominent hotelier, Mr. Samuel Alamutu spent most of his time in top Nigerian hotels. The nature of his work and position afforded him many opportunities to wine and dine with his family and friends both at home and in his workplace. Mr.Samuel Alamutu attended a lot of functions and was a connoisseur of top-quality wine and champagne from around the world. According to his daughter Sola Alamutu who provided the context for this piece \u201c, he was quick to pop open a bottle of wine or champagne on special occasions.\u201d Mr. Samuel Alamutu was a family man and when he was out with his beloved wife, she would turn down any offer of alcoholic drink and instead ask for soft drinks \u2013 either Fanta, sprite, or ginger ale.\n\nThis became a huge bother for Mr. Samuel Alamutu, which prompted him to gather a handful of people and decided to create something a little more exotic that his wife could have at functions, especially those functions hosted by him. He started experimenting with different drinks and eventually came up with a mix of lemon and orange drink with a dash of Angostura bitters (which are from Trinidad and Tobago) and always on the rocks! Et voil\u00e0! His wife loved it and so did everyone else. With the positive reviews that he had garnered, he took it a step further and garnished it with cucumber, a lemon slice and topped it off with a cherry on a toothpick, and that is how the famous drink was created and spread across the world, thanks to a man\u2019s love for his wife.\n\nMr. Samuel Alamutu\n\nHow the Chapman spread across the world\n\nAccording to his daughter Sola Alamutu, Ikoyi Hotel in Lagos was the first place the Chapman was created for the public. Samuel Alamutu also introduced it to other hotels across the country, in addition to the Ikoyi hotel and the others in the NHL chain of hotels which he managed covering Jos, Lagos, Kano (Central Hotel), Sokoto, Maiduguri (Lake Chad Hotel), Calabar.\n\nThis is how the Chapman drink started to spread in Nigeria and the world. As a very well-traveled man, he formed relationships with hotels and restaurateurs in countries such as Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and other African countries. During his travels to the UK, he enjoyed visiting different restaurants and made many friends.\n\nAt the time, many of the top hotels were indeed occupied by British guests, which is the root of the confusion that it is a British invention. Everybody loved the Chapman and many British people did spread the gospel of the infamous drink.To set the record straight, let us clearly state here that the Chapman is a Nigerian invention created by Mr. Samuel Alamutu of Ogun State.\n\nRead also: The fury of floods and food insecurity\n\nAbout Mr. Samuel Alamutu\n\nSamuel Alamutu, MON, FIH (UK), FNHCI also fondly called \u2018Daddy\u2019 Alamutu by his children, was born on the 13th of November 1933, at Ifo Town near Abeokuta, Ogun State. He was the 4th of 5 children of the Late Mr. Ameen Badru Oreitan Alamutu of Mokola, Ilugun, Abeokuta, and the late Alhaja Asimohu Subuol Abeke (nee Akinlawo of Ikija, Abeokuta). He attended primary school at the Holy Trinity and later the famous Abeokuta Grammar School, Oke-Igbein, Abeokuta, Ogun State from 1947 to 1952 under the principalship of the late indefatigable educationist \u2013 Rev. I. O. Ransome-Kuti.\n\nIn December of 1952, he passed the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Examination when he left Abeokuta Grammar School and worked briefly from 1953 to 1955 at the Nigerian Railway Corporation and the Federal Board of Inland Revenue Department of the Federal Civil Service, respectively, before proceeding to the United Kingdom in 1955 to study with the scholarship obtained from the Western Region Government.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1958, he studied Catering and Hotel Management at the Huddersfield Polytechnic, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England as part of Awolowo\u2019s program of educating the West and mingled with catering specialists such as Ade Adefeso and Wale Akinrinade. He collected an array of impressive credentials before returning home to Nigeria in August 1958. He later obtained a Postgraduate Diploma at the Centre for Management Development, University of Cambridge, England, and became the most prominent professional Hotelier.\n\nIn September of 1958, he joined the Nigeria Hotels Limited (the largest \u2013 Federal Government-owned group in Nigeria) and worked there in various capacities for 25 years of meritorious service, until his voluntary retirement in October 1983 from the position of Managing Director and Chief Executive of the Company. He then became the director of the Lagos Hotels Limited, Hill Station Hotel Limited, Jos, Western Hotels Limited, and Cross River Hotels Limited.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965 he also served as Training Consultant to the Sierra Leone Government for their Paramount Hotel and Cape Sierra Hotel, Freetown respectively.\n\nHe was also the director of Nigeria Tourist Board and the first National President, Nigeria Hotel and Catering Institute, the Chairman of Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation and the pioneer Chairman, Hotel and Personal Services Employers\u2019 Association of Nigeria.\n\nIn 1978, he was conferred with the National Honours Award of M. O. N. (Member of the Order of the Niger) for his pioneering work and dedication to the Hotel, Catering, and Tourism Industry in Nigeria.\n\nMr. Samuel Alamutu was the longest-serving Managing Director/Chief Executive of the Nigeria Hotels Limited before retiring to establish his own Hotel Management and Consultancy Company \u2013 Modern Hotels Limited \u2013 for which he was Executive Chairman.\n\nBetween 1988- 1998 he owned and managed Park restaurant, in central Lagos. The restaurant was renowned for its haute cuisine and first-class international service. His daughter, Sola Alamutu aka Green queen who, incidentally, also studied Hospitality management like her father, was the restaurant manager.\n\nMr. Samuel Alamutu loved music, which was an integral part of his life. He was also an avid dancer. He had a passion for photography and took pictures of absolutely everything and loved sports, practicing sports such as lawn tennis and swimming but also indoor games such as table tennis, scrabble, ludo, and monopoly. He was loved by his family friends and peers.\n\nDaddy Alamutu passed away on the 17th of December 2011 but his legacy lives on. He leaves behind his beloved and 5 children.\n\nThe volume of misinformation and ambiguity on the origins of this monumental African drink raises many questions: Mainly how do we protect Nigerian/African inventions and intellectual property? How do we ensure that history is properly told and recorded?\n\nThere is a company in the United Kingdom that has patented \u2018CHAPMANS\u2019 as trademarked in the UK, which is unfortunate, as it is not in any way linked back to its real creator. In Africa we continue to have intellectual property issues and I think It will be interesting to see how this story and many other similar ones, evolve.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development have filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari and Mr. Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture.\n\nSERAP asked the court to \u201cdeclare illegal the gag order stopping journalists and broadcast stations from reporting details of terrorist attacks and victims, as the order violates media freedom and Nigerians\u2019 freedom of expression and access to information.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as Defendant is the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC).\n\nThe suit followed the directive by NBC asking journalists, television and radio stations in Nigeria to stop \u201cglamourising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers\u201d during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/725/2021 filed last Friday, SERAP and PTCIJ are seeking: \u201can order of perpetual injunction restraining the government of President Buhari, the NBC, and Mr Lai Muhammed or any other persons from imposing fines or other sanctions on broadcast stations for carrying out their constitutional duties of reporting details of terrorist attacks and victims during daily newspaper reviews.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, SERAP and PTCIJ are seeking \u201can order to compel and direct the NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed to withdraw the directive asking journalists and broadcast stations to stop reporting details on terrorist attacks and victims, as the directive is unlawful and inconsistent with the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], and the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\nSERAP and PTCIJ are also seeking \u201can order setting aside the directive on reporting of terrorist attacks and victims, for being inconsistent and incompatible with sections 22 and 39 of the Nigerian Constitution, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cUnless the reliefs sought are urgently granted by this Honourable Court, the directive by the NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed would be used to impermissibly restrict Nigerians\u2019 rights to freedom of expression, access to information, media freedom, and victims\u2019 right to justice and effective remedies.\u201d\n\nSERAP and PTCIJ are arguing that \u201cthe failure by the government of President Buhari to direct the NBC to withdraw its directive on reporting of terrorist attacks and victims violates sections 5[a] and [b], 147 and 148 of the Nigerian Constitution, Code of Conduct for Public Officers [Fifth Schedule Part 1], and Oath of office [Seventh Schedule] of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nSERAP and PTCIJ are also seeking \u201ca declaration that sections 5.4.1[f] and 5.4.3 of the National Broadcasting Code and their application to the daily review of newspaper headlines by broadcast stations are inconsistent with sections 22 and 39 of the Nigerian Constitution, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP and PTCIJ: \u201cThe NBC directive fails to establish a direct and immediate connection between the reporting by broadcast stations and purported risks to national security and peace. The NBC is using \u2018national security\u2019 as a pretext to intimidate and harass journalists and broadcast stations, and to violate Nigerians\u2019 rights to freedom of expression and access to information.\u201d\n\nSERAP and PTCIJ are also arguing that: \u201cFactual reporting on the growing violence in some parts of Nigeria is a matter of public interest. National security considerations should be limited in application to situations in which the interest of the whole nation is at stake, which would thereby exclude restrictions in the sole interest of a government, regime, or power group.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP and PTCIJ by their lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part: \u201cThe NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed lack the power and authority to restrict the ability of journalists and broadcast stations to carry out their constitutional duties and to unlawfully impose penalty such as fines and other sanctions on any journalists and broadcast stations for reporting on details of terrorist attacks and victims in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP and PTCIJ together with several millions of Nigerians easily access information, news and form opinions on government policies through the daily newspaper reviews by journalists and broadcast stations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the NBC has the powers to make rules to enable it perform its statutory functions under section 2[1] [a] to [u] of NBC Act, such statutory powers ought to be exercised in line with the Nigerian Constitution, and the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pertinent questions that arise from the directive are: Who determines what would amount to \u2018too many details\u2019, \u2018glamourising\u2019, \u2018divisive rhetoric\u2019, and \u2018security issues\u2019 during the daily review of newspaper headlines? What constitutes \u2018divisive materials\u2019 during the daily review of newspaper headlines by journalists and broadcast stations?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn law, a regulation that is vague and loose in its scope cannot be used to take away constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe interference with the constitutional and legal duties of journalists and broadcast stations cannot be justified, as Nigerian authorities have failed to show that reporting of terrorist attacks and victims would impose a specific risk of harm to a legitimate State interest that outweighs the public\u2019s interest in such information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is the grundnorm and the fundamental law of the land. All other legislations in this country take their hierarchy from the provisions of the Constitution. It is not a mere common legal document.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Courts as the veritable agency for the protection and preservation of rule of law should ensure that persons and institutions operate within the defined ambit of constitutional and statutory limitations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere agencies of government are allowed to operate at large and at their whims and caprices in the guise of performing their statutory duties, the end result will be anarchy, licentiousness, authoritarianism and brigandage leading to the loss of the much cherished and constitutionally guaranteed freedom and liberty.\u201d\n\nHowever, no date has been fixed for the hearing of the application for an interim injunction, and the substantive suit.",

Nigeria government cannot beat a child and force him or her not to cry. IPOB has every right to be in court on that day,\u201d Emma Powerful, IPOB\u2019s mouthpiece, told Vanguard.\n\n\u201cAnybody who doesn\u2019t want to go to court is free to do so but Mallami and Federal Government of Nigeria have no powers or rights to stop anybody from going to Abuja.\n\n\u201cOne thing they forget is that it\u2019s not about Nnamdi Kanu, it\u2019s about Biafra. The issue of Biafra agitation has since gone beyond Nnamdi Kanu. It\u2019s now an unstoppable mass movement.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that not just IPOB members but thousands of Biafrans and their sympathizers will flood Abuja on Monday to show solidarity to our leader, Nnamdi Kanu. He is only a freedom fighter and Nigeria cannot stop people from identifying with him.\n\n\u201cSo, if they want to shoot or kill people they should prepare very well because they will have enough to kill or arrest.\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid and can\u2019t be afraid at this point of our journey when our freedom is at the threshold. We can\u2019t abandon our leader.\n\n\u201cThe only thing is that we shall be very civil, organized and peaceful but we can\u2019t be cowed.

          "text": "Another pastor, who was one of the 40 pastors recently fired by Bishop David Oyedepo\u2019s Living Faith Church, told how pastors who were graduates were paid N38,000 per month.\n\nAccording to the pastor, the gross income was N53,000, but they only received N38,000 because the rest was supposed to cover pension and housing allowance.\n\nThe victim, who preferred to speak on condition of anonymity, noted that the money deducted for pensions was not even remitted to their bank accounts until their sack and outrage went viral.\n\nHe said, \u201cOyedepo and his senior Pastors knew they would sack us before employing us. That was why they gave us employment on probation. Someone went online to post lies in support of the church that the recently sacked pastors were being paid N80,000 and house rent of N150,000.\n\n\u201cI will just say a little here; no employed pastor was paid N80,000 in the church. The highest salary is for degree holders which is N53,000 and, this N53,000 is not the net salary at the end of the month. The pastor will only receive N38,000 at the end of the month; N6,000 goes to the pension account and N9,000 goes to house rent account.\n\n\u201cIt is very funny that the pastors, we honoured, could keep the money they removed from our salaries in their personal bank accounts for long without paying into our pension accounts. It was when they sacked us that they started paying into the pension accounts. Imagine that.",

The administration of His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has approved the extension as part of efforts to make it easier for its citizens within and outside the country, and legal residents to obtain the NIN and it is important to take advantage of the extension.\n\n\u201cThe NIN-SIM linkage also makes it easier for the security agencies to carry out their statutory duties and the relevant parastatals under the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy are supporting them as required.\n\n\u201cThere are now a total of 59.8 million unique NIN enrolments, with an average of three to four SIMs per NIN. With the great number of enrolment centres within and outside the country, and many more coming up, every citizen, legal resident, and Nigerian citizens living in the diaspora should be able to obtain their NINs.\u201d\n\nThe statement quoted the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, as commending the Kano State Government and other States that have made NINs a key requirement for school enrolments and access to other important services.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe Federal Government is also excited at the news that the use of NIN in the process of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board exam significantly reduced the challenge of exam malpractice.\n\n\u201cThe Minister, on behalf of the Federal Government, appreciates Nigerians for their patience and compliance with the Federal Government\u2019s directive on the NIN-SIM registration exercise.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Prof Umar Garba Dambatta, and the Director-General/CEO of that National Identity Management Commission, Engr Aliyu Azeez, urge citizens and legal residents to make sure they use the opportunity to complete the process of enrolment and verification before the October 31st deadline.\u201d",

          "text": "Senator representing Bayelsa West District in the National Assembly, Seriake Dickson, has described the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB , and the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 by the parliament as offensive and insensitive to concerned Nigerians.\n\nDickson, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja over the perceived shortcomings in the two bills, however, warned that the approved three percent Host Communities Trust Fund in the PIB may lead to unrest in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThis is as he justified the backlash being faced by the Senate from Nigerians over amendment made to clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, which according to him, unconstitutionally subordinated independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC\n\nThe former Bayelsa State governor specifically declared that the PIB passed with 3% for Host Communities Fund, will not in anyway, help Nigeria and investors in the oil and gas sectors .\n\nAccording to him, the 5% earlier recommended by both Committees of the National Assembly which is even lower to the 10% being demanded for by stakeholders across the various oil producing communities, supposed to have been retained in the interest of fairness, justice and equity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen PIB was first introduced and forwarded to the National Assembly by the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, 10% was proposed for Host Communities fund and Frontier Basins for exploration of oil as against the Bill recently passed, given 3% for Host Communities and 30% for Frontier Basins.\n\n\u201cThese, as far as the people of Niger Delta or oil producing states are concerned are unjustifiable and look like opening another chapter for unrest in the area which will not benefit anybody.\n\n\u201cImagine the problem the country has been facing with Boko Haram insurgency in the North East for the past ten years , the Armed banditry and Kidnapping also being faced in the North West within the last three to four years as well as agitations being faced in South West and South East, to now be added up with avoidable crisis in the South South.\n\n\u201cThose of us from the area did our best to prevail on our colleagues to listen to us and buy into our demands but number or majority position was used , which in actual fact do not build a nation with diversities like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMight and majority do not build a diversified nation like Nigeria, but presence of justice, fairness. Mere reliance on numbers without fairness, equity and justice is inimical to nation building,\u201d he added.\n\nHe therefore appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari not to assent to the bill, but send it back for more consultation and required Inclusiveness in its proposals.\n\nHe disclosed that he along with other lawmakers from the zone staged a walk out from the dinner night President Muhamnadu Buhari had with the 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, held before the final consideration and passage of the bill when they discovered that it was 3% being canvassed for host communities.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible evening for us on account of the 3% proposal, which as a politician of conviction and not that of convenience, led to my walk out from the dinner along with some other senators.\n\n\u201cWe put up the required moves on the floor of the Senate to push it up to 5% as recommended by the joint committees of both chambers but those who rely solely on numbers, have their way,\u201d he further argued.\n\nOn the controversial amendment made by the Senate on Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, Dickson said the backlash being received by Senate over the amendment was not unexpected because the original proposal made in the clause had already taken care of whatever exigencies being envisaged on electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Senate Commitee on INEC, the phrase of where and when practicable used in clause 52(3) was enough to take care of any exigencies , making the amendment which included NCC in the entire process, unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cFortunately a window of striking out that amendment is already provided by the House of Representatives which adopted the clause as originally proposed.\n\n\u201cSo it is expected that the earlier version of the clause, will be the one to be adopted by the confluence Commitee which will be set up by both chambers for the required harmonization of reports before transmitting the bill to the President for assent,\u201d he said.",

Yet, the government didn\u2019t pay much attention to Boko Haram. Until 2009, when the group\u2019s leader, Mohammed Yusuf, was murdered while in police custody, setting off an inexorable chain of violent events that has threatened the very existence of the Nigerian state. Twelve years later, thousands have died and hundreds of thousands more have been displaced or remain in captivity. Yet, the insurgency is far from over. Here is a timeline of events of Nigeria\u2019s never-ending conflict:\n\n2002: Mohammed Yusuf founds Boko Haram, a group with the aim to \u2018purify\u2019 Islam in Northern Nigeria.\n\nJuly 2009:

          "text": "Protesters have taken to the streets across Brazil once more to demand far-right President Jair Bolsonaro step down over his government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as recent corruption allegations.\n\nDemonstrators marched in Rio de Janeiro and several other cities nationwide on Saturday in the latest display of public anger and frustration to hit the South American nation in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re protesting about many things: the government\u2019s downplaying of the pandemic, the president\u2019s spurning of health safety measures, the slow rollout of vaccines, which has picked up in the last couple of weeks,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Monica Yanakiew reported from Rio.\n\n\u201cBut still Brazil was a country that should not have had these problems because it is a country that is usually prepared for mass vaccination.\u201d\n\nProtest organisers said actions were scheduled to take place in 500 locations across Brazil and outside the country, the Folha de S Paulo newspaper reported. The demonstrators complained about Brazil\u2019s late-starting vaccination programme and high unemployment rate, and demanded more emergency aid for poor people grappling with the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because it is time to react to the genocidal government that we have, that has taken over our country,\u201d said Marcos Kirst, a protester in Sao Paulo.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that everyone who feels offended or oppressed by this government comes out to the streets, because we need to fight for the return to democracy,\u201d Laise de Oliveira, a 65-year-old social worker, told the AFP news agency in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBolsonaro, a coronavirus sceptic who has repeatedly played down the severity of COVID-19, for months has rejected calls to impose public health restrictions to stem the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 548,000 people across Brazil, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThat is the second-highest death toll in the world after the United States.\n\nA protester holds a banner that reads \u2018Vaccine\u2019 and \u2018Impeachment\u2019 during a demonstration against Boslonaro in Rio de Janeiro [Ricardo Moraes/Reuters]\n\nA Brazilian Senate commission in April launched an investigation into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis, while Bolsonaro has seen his popularity drop amid a string of scandals. A recent poll showed a majority of Brazilians would support an effort to impeach him.\n\nThe far-right leader is under political pressure after questions surfaced about alleged irregularities in his government\u2019s coronavirus vaccine procurement process, as well as accusations of past corruption. Bolsonaro has denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is a continuous loss of political support for the president,\u201d Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Brazil, told Al Jazeera. Couto said while political will to impeach Bolsonaro is rising, the president retains considerable support in Congress.\n\n\u201cSince it is necessary two obtain at least two-thirds of the votes both in the House and at the Senate \u2013 (and) Bolsonaro has at least 40 percent of the seats both in the House and the Senate \u2013 it\u2019s impossible today,\u201d Couto said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the number of coronavirus deaths begins to recede and local restrictions are being rolled back in some places, experts have questioned whether Brazil\u2019s inoculation effort can pick up enough steam to stave off the spread of more contagious variants of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Delta variant is boosting cases and deaths globally after a period of decline, and the World Health Organization anticipates it will become dominant within months.\n\n\u201cIt will be explosive,\u201d Gonzalo Vecina, a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo, told The Associated Press news agency. \u201cThere will be a new wave. We are opening too much.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s Health Ministry counted 140 cases of the Delta variant by Friday, including in its three most populous states, and 12 deaths. Analysts say the figures are vast undercounts due to lack of testing and genome sequencing.\n\nDelta has been detected in at least 18 Latin American countries, according to the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nBrazilian Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said last week that getting more of the population vaccinated is the best way to stop the variant, but he insists that Brazil must resume its economic activities.\n\n\u201cWe have available hospital bed capacity and we will live with this pandemic until we can control it definitively,\u201d Queiroga said on Wednesday, stressing the importance of knowing whether each person infected with the variant has already had one shot or two.\n\nTo date, 17 percent of the Brazilian population is considered fully vaccinated while 44 percent have received the first of two jabs. The AstraZeneca shot makes up nearly half of all vaccines administered, China\u2019s Sinovac more than a third, and Pfizer most of the rest.",

          "text": "Tens of thousands of people across several countries, including France and Italy, have protested against anti-covid measures, with the French police using tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters in the capital Paris.\n\nIn France, an estimated 160,000 took to the streets in nationwide protests against President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s health pass that will drastically curtail access to restaurants and public spaces for unvaccinated people.\n\n\u201cFreedom, freedom\u201d, chanted demonstrators in France, carrying placards denouncing \u201cMacron, Tyrant\u201d, \u201cBig Pharma shackles freedom\u201d or saying \u201cNo to the pass of shame\u201d.\n\nA similar scheme, called \u201cgreen pass\u201d, has sparked angry demonstrations across Italy. People in Rome, Naples and Turin chanted \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cdown with the dictatorship\u201d over plans for the so-called \u201cgreen pass\u201d.\n\nThe certificate will be needed from early next month to eat in restaurants and visit cinemas among other indoor activities.\n\nMany people gathered without wearing masks \u2013 but the turnout was lower than expected.\n\nThousands of people have also protested in London, against what they describe as an erosion of their civil liberties.\n\nDemonstrators say the UK government\u2019s track and trace app is limiting their movements, with more than 600,000 told to self-isolate in one week alone this month. The protests come a week after most Coronavirus restrictions in England were lifted.\n\nEarlier, dozens of protesters were arrested after an unauthorised march in Sydney, Australia\u2019s largest city. Organisers had dubbed the protest a \u201cfreedom\u201d rally. Attendees carried signs and banners reading \u201cWake up Australia\u201d and \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d.\n\nHeidi Larson, a professor of anthropology, risk and decision science at the department of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Al Jazeera that the health pass \u201cmakes a lot of sense\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd ironically for those who want their freedoms, the vaccine can allow different freedoms,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it, the options to this pass is that we close restaurants, we stop large gatherings. We have to give somewhere if we want to get ahead of this virus,\u201d Larson said.\n\nGabriel Scally, a visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, told Al Jazeera that there was nothing new to the opposition to the pandemic measures.\n\n\u201cI think these rallies are relatively small. All the way through the pandemic, we have seen small groups of people who have taken to the streets to express their opposition to various things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome believe that the virus does not exist, that COVID-19 doesn\u2019t exist. Some think that it\u2019s a conspiracy from all sorts of people, including Bill Gates\u2026\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything new. There has been opposition to vaccines in history. It\u2019s new and people are dealing with various issues. There are always a small group of people who are opposed.\u201d\n\nLegislators in France\u2019s senate debated the bill on Saturday after the lower house of parliament approved it on Friday.\n\nThe government is trying to speed up vaccination to protect vulnerable populations and hospitals and avoid new lockdowns.\n\nMost French adults are fully vaccinated and polls indicate a majority of French people support the new measures.\n\nBut not everyone. Protesters chanting \u201cLiberty! Liberty!\u201d marched through Paris in one of multiple demonstrations planned on Saturday.\n\nLast weekend, more than 100,000 people protested across France against the measures.\n\nThey included far-right politicians and activists as well as some others angry at President Emmanuel Macron for various reasons.\n\nSeparately, in Indonesia and the UK, governments have pressed ahead with the easing of restrictions even in the face of surging infections.\n\nMeanwhile, about 5,000 people demonstrated in Athens, carrying placards touting slogans such as, \u201cDon\u2019t touch our children\u201d, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.\n\nIn Sydney, demonstrators pelted officers with pot plants and bottles of water as they defied a month-long stay-at-home order, a day after authorities suggested the restrictions could remain in place until October.\n\nNew South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the protesters whose \u201cselfish actions have compromised the safety of all of us\u201d.\n\nPolice said they issued nearly 100 fines and arrested 57 people.
