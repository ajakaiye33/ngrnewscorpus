          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Ike Uchechukwu\n\nAt least three persons have been reportedly killed in a fresh communal clash which broke out in Odukpani local government area of Cross River State with several properties worth millions of naira also destroyed and many people injured.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman of Odukpani Local Government Area Mr. Aniofiok Inyang who visited the area on Wednesday confirmed to journalists that three persons were reportedly killed.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo from among Okoyong community and one among the Ikot Offiong people.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the clash was between the Ikot Offiong people who went to settle in Ubambat, one of the villages within the Okoyong Community and they are now fighting the people of Okoyong.\n\nHe said he went to appeal for calm and restraint and that Security agencies have been mobilized to the area.\n\nIn a swift reaction, the Police Public Relation Officer in the state, DSP Irene Ugbo told Vanguard that no one was killed but some person were injured and some houses were torched.\n\nShe said: \u201d Nobody was killed but we have deployed personnel to affected communities to restore peace and we hope that the place will be calm soon.\n\n\u201d Two persons were injured, there no death recorded in the place as I speak with you,\u201d Irene said.\n\nHowever, another source who is an indigene of the Okoyong Community, Com. Ekpeyong Akiba further confirmed t the incident stressing that tension was still high in Okoyong.\n\n\u201cTension is still high in the Okoyong Communities as people have started parking and relocating from the community.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, he said that the Ikot Offiong People sparked the fresh crisis on the early hours of Wednesday when they suddenly mobilized from Ubambat village, a place they forcefully occupied in the Okoyong Community.\n\n\u201cFrom Ubambat, they moved to Usongurua towards Akpap-Okoyong chanting war songs and attacking buildings and persons along the way, vowing that others will also be made refugees like them since they are asked to leave Ubambat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIkot Offiong people are part of Odukpani Local Government area and they have age long communal clash with the Oku people in Itu Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. The Oku People had since displaced the Ikot Offiong people from their land.\n\n\u201cThe Okoyong Community knew that the Ikot Offiong people in want of a place to settle forcefully occupied the Ubambat village. Okoyong people did not challenge them being that they of the same local government area origin.\n\n\u201d But when it was noticed that they (Ikot Offiong People) have sustained their war with the Oku people and that from Ubambat they have been going out to commit crimes, pressure came on the Okoyong Community elders, including accusations from the Oku Community that the Okoyong community is backing Ikot Offiong to attack Oku.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is at that instance that Okoyong elders sent a message advising the Ikot Offiong settlers in Ubambat to cease staying there to launch attack at other communities or commit crimes.\n\n\u201cThat was all and the next thing is this attack on Okoyong Community. There have so far killed two persons in Okoyong. We heard they moved to Usong Urua village and started attacking people and went as far as the Akpap village close to the primary school in Akpap.\n\n\u201cThey stopped at one Etubom Ene\u2019s compound. They destroyed buildings there. They were armed, shooting into the crowd of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the course of their shooting, a lady was killed instantly. She is popularly known as Adiaha-Udo. Another person, Ebe Iyamba was killed along the way to Akpab.\n\n\u201cPeople are packing and leaving the Okonyong communities because there hear Akpap village will be attacked at night. We learnt they have a leader who leads their war group. Simply known as Effiong Sabate A.K.A \u201cThe General.\u201d he said .\n\nRecall that the state government on Tuesday inaugurated a peace and resolution committee led by a former Senator, Victor Ndoma-Egba to resolve another long-aged war in four communities in Abi LGA if the state.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "2023: Council boss blasts Egwu, NASS members, others for politicizing security situation in Ebonyi",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Peter Okutu\n\nTHE Chairman of Afikpo South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Dr. Eni Uduma Chima, Thursday blasted some Ebonyi State National Assembly members for playing politics with the security situation in the State.\n\nThese National Assembly members led by Dr. Sam Egwu had last Tuesday addressed the Press in Abuja on the security situation in the State with growing concern about the inauguration of the South East Security Network code-named \u201cEbubeagu\u201d in the State.\n\nThe two-time lawmaker who described the National Assembly members as a \u201cband of opportunists advertising their crass ignorance, shallow intellect and weak brain-power to a country facing her worst challenge in insecurity by speaking out against the practical attempts by Ebonyi State people to survive serious threats to their very existence as a people.\u201d argued that \u201cthe unravelling security infrastructure favours neither the PDP nor APC, neither children nor adults, neither Christians nor Muslims, neither the rich nor the poor and certainly, neither Abuja based or Non-Abuja based politicians.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman stated this in press statement titled \u201cThe hollow sanctimony of Senator Sam Ominyi Egwu with some Ebonyi State Law makers; a glaring ignorance of the home situation and expression of political frustration.\u201d in Abakaliki.\n\nEni further warned against the politicization of the precarious security situation in Ebonyi State noting that \u201cunless the right steps are taken as Governor Umahi is doing, let these Legislators know that there may be no 2023 General Elections for which they dance naked in public.\u201d\n\nThe Council boss further noted that \u201cfor the Abuja Legislators to distract serious minded statesmen with party gibberish at this critical period and trying times which require sobriety and total concentration to the essence of Government which is the security and welfare of the people, is to be myopic and uncharitable to the millions of people who have invested hope in them as representatives.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs usual, While Ebonyi people are grappling with imminent existential threats, these Federal Law Makers of Ebonyi State origin are focused on 2023 General Elections and politics at the expense of the security and welfare of the masses.\n\n\u201cThis philistine posturing has confirmed that indeed, conscientious statesmen like Governor David Nweze Umahi think for the next generation while bread and butter politicians like the Abuja bunch think of the next election. To them, politics is an endless cycle of elections with no regard to service and this is why they read political undertones into every laudable stride of the Ebonyi State Governor.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe gist of the mumble-jumble from these self-serving Legislators is a complain against the South Eastern security Outfit code-named \u201d Ebubeagu\u201d. According to them, Governor Umahi committed offence by making Ebonyi State \u201d the first and only state in the South East to inaugurate and arm the so-called Ebubeagu\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne is constrained to question the logic of the attack on the setting up of a vigilante outfit against the backdrop of their lucid interval observations, of heightened insecurity. From all indications, these misguided Legislators are on a self-serving mission as can be clearly seen in the last paragraph of the watery write up to say \u201d that the Inspector General of Police should note that Governor Umahi should be held directly responsible should any harm befall any member of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn the light of this expression, it follows that Governor Umahi or any other person for that matter should be free and that the rest of Ebonyi State indigenes and Nigerian Citizens resident in Ebonyi State, can go to hell should any harm befall them since they are not members of the National Assembly, this is the height of selfishness.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily one should not have reacted to this shameful outing by the pusillanimous Legislators, if not for their insensitive reference to the thirteen Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State where they allege that Pump Action and Ak47 Rifles were distributed under the guise of \u201cEbubeagu\u201d vigilante.\n\n\u201cAssuming without conceding that such weapons were distributed, pray, how many times has Dr. Sam Egwu and his colleagues spoken out against Boko Haram and ISIS fighters using Ak47, Anti- Aircraft Guns, Machine Guns, Armoured Tanks etc to fight the country? Why has none of these Abuja based Legislators spoken out against incessant burning of police stations, killing of security personnel, most of who are Ebonyi State and South \u2013 East indigenes and burning of public infrastructure including the office of Independent National Electoral Commission apparently by unknown Gunmen?\n\n\u201cHow many times has Dr. Sam Egwu queried the \u201cforeign\u201d herdsmen wielding Ak47 in the forests of different Local Government Areas in Ebonyi State on the floor of the Senate or even in the Senate Cafeteria where he feels at home?\n\n\u201cBy the accounts of Dr. Sam Egwu and his pack of unserious Legislators, \u201cEbonyi State is awash with weapons supplied and distributed by the State Government to persons who are neither documented, nor trained in weapons handling\u201d The village champions in Abuja could not say anything about undocumented weapons in the hands of Bandits who kidnap in singles and en masse for ransom, Unknown Gun Men and other violent criminals ravaging the Country without let or hindrance.\n\n\u201cThe cock and bull story of the alleged kidnap of one dismissed Co-ordinator of a Development Centre who found nothing wrong with the Umahi Administration until he was dismissed for dereliction of duties and other offences, coming from Senator Egwu is to say the least, very disappointing. If a certain Amos Ogbonnaya was offended by one \u2018Consider\u2019, I expect Senator Sam Egwu to brief his lawyers to do the needful, except of course, it is a false alarm. And to think of it, the said Amos is a good lawyer who can seek redress on his own or is this \u2018Consider\u2019 of a person under immunity that he cannot be arrested and prosecuted if there\u2019s any substance in the allegation of beatings?\n\n\u201cIf there had been any real issue other than shadow boxing and quixotic quest for relevance, one ordinarily expects a person of Dr. Sam Egwu\u2019s status to adopt a statesman\u2019s posture of uniting Ebonyi State people above partisan sentiments, instead of his current high school boy grandstanding and playing to the gallery. It is not far from the truth that the Agriculturist may have been blinded by jealousy on the superlative achievements of Gov. Umahi, a man who has made indelible marks in a State in which Dr.Egwu\u2019s greatest achievement was the inauguration of classroom blocks.\n\n\u201cThe circumstance is that of the House of David waxing stronger and stronger in Ebonyi State while the House of Saul (or one can dare say house of Sam) growing weaker and weaker. In sum, the juvenile tantrums of the Ebonyi State Legislators in a cafeteria in Abuja is an unequivocal expression of psychological defeatism and political frustrations over irreversible political misfortune which has confined them to lame duck legislators with the bleak prospect of mass rejection by the good people of Ebonyi State come 2023.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

We all need to as a team, work ahead of the president by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us.\n\n\u201cI believe that if everyone of us as governor joins hands with Mr President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development, an elated Buni said he and his team were in the state to formally welcome Governor Ayade to the APC.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am here on behalf of the APC family to welcome His Excellency the Executive Governor of Cross River State formally to the APC. As from today he is the leader of the party in the state.\u201d\n\nOther APC governors who witnessed the event were Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Solomon Lalong of Plateau State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu and his Jigawa state counterpart, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar.\n\nAlso present was the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nOthers at the meeting were the state deputy governor, Prof Ivara Esu, Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Rt.

A youth leader, Abashe Dauda, told Daily Sun that 11 bodies were discovered at Gaida Kaso and five others missing when gunmen launched an offensive on Gaida Kaso and Wako Kaso villages, Kakau Ward in Chikun local government area of Kaduna State, on Tuesday. He added that two other persons were shot at Wako Kaso village, but survived the attack that lasted for hours.\n\nHe said the killings in the adjoining agrarian communities were becoming tensed up daily with no tangible help from the government to salvage the situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cA community called Gaida Kaso village, Kakau ward, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna state, was attacked on 18/5/2021 by unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cThe attack was carried out at about 3am, houses were set ablaze, 11 persons confirmed dead and five are nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cThe gunmen also attacked a nearby community called Wako in Kaso Village, two were shot and sustained gunshot injury and are receiving treatment.\n\n\u201cAssemblies of God Church and one mission house were burnt down in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Kaduna State Police Command and the State\u2019s Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs are yet to make any official statement about the development as the time of filing this report.\n\nAlso, on Tuesday night, armed bandits reportedly attacked Batsari town in Batsari Local Government Area in Katsina State, killing one person and abducted 21 others.\n\nAn eyewitness said that the armed bandits stormed into Batsari community at about 10:20pm and started shooting sporadically before they abducted 21 persons, mostly women and children, while a man simply identified as Alhaji Hassan was shot dead.\n\nEfforts to get the police authorities in Katsina State to comment on the incident proved abortive as the spokesperson, Gambo Isah, did not respond to calls to his phone.\n\nThe police command had, earlier on Tuesday night, confirmed the abduction of a judge, Alhaji Husaini Sama\u2019ila, by gunmen at a Shari\u2019a Court at Baure Zaka village in Safana Local Government Area of the State. The judge was said to have been kidnapped around 3:00 pm, on Tuesday, while on a personal visit to the court.\n\nThe police spokesman: \u201cAs you all know, the court has not been on the session since the commencement of the strike action embarked by the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN).\n\n\u201cThe judge took the risk and went to the court. He didn\u2019t inform the police about his going to the court, knowing fully that the place is not secured enough,\u201d he said.",

The greatest challenge today is insecurity. To travel some distance today calls for serious prayers and traveling with, perhaps, heavy security personnel because of kidnapping for ransom, ritual killing, armed robbery, insurgents attacks, banditry and other forms of violent attacks.\n\n\u201cBreaking the nation into fragments will not be the answer, rather proactiveness of those in power to guide agitators for secession to the right step; to treat the nation as one one. To do otherwise is to gamble dangerously.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, setting up of the body of security experts that will investigate the sources of ammunition that are in the hands of criminals spread all over the nation, in order to block such avenues, has not been seen to be done by the government.\n\n\u201cIt makes this a cause of concern about the sincerity of the government in nipping these evils in the bud. We want to see the criminals prosecuted. Otherwise, the government will be seen as aiding and abetting criminality.\n\n\u201cThis is the time for us to unite and speak in unison against all these evils before being wiped away by the criminals. The daily bloodshed is worrisome and must stop,\u201d he said.\n\nOlasupo also buttressed the need for government to tackle the issue of mass unemployment, which is one of the major reasons criminality thrives in the country.\n\n\u201cThe time is now for those in authority to address the problem of mass unemployment in our nation. It\u2019s the breeding ground for criminality, and equally gives the bandits and terrorists opportunity to recruit the youths into criminality with ease,\u201d he noted.\n\nIn his remarks, Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, who is also co-chairman of NIREC, emphasised that dialogue is the most effective and peaceful way for the country to reach a resolution to its problems.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s continue to work together and dialogue. I\u2019m a total believer in dialogue and nothing will change my mind, because my religion teaches me to always dialogue. If we can solve our problems without going to war, then why do we need to take up arms to solve the problem,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u2022Two more offices set ablaze in Ebonyi\n\n\u2022Meets with security agencies May 24\n\nBy Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki\n\nChairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday expressed concern about the spate of arson attack on its facilities, especially in the South-east, warning that it might compromise the commission\u2019s ability to conduct hitch-free elections in future.\n\nThe commission has also shifted a planned meeting with security agencies to brainstorm on protecting its assets, earlier scheduled for yesterday to Monday.\n\nThe number of INEC\u2019s facilities torched in recent months rose to 23 yesterday as hoodlums set ablaze two of the commission\u2019s offices in Ebonyi State.\n\nYakubu, at a meeting yesterday in Abuja with the Resident Electoral Commissioners (REC) from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), said event in the recent past like the burning of the offices and damage to the INEC property would endanger the conduct of elections in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cUnfortunately, some events in the recent past have challenged the commission and adversely affected our commitment to continue to improve the electoral process. The spate of arson and vandalism targeting the commission\u2019s facilities and property has become profoundly worrisome.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this has been on the rise since the 2019 general election but has now developed into a crisis. In the last three weeks or so, three of our local government offices in Essien Udim in Akwa Ibom State, Ohafia in Abia State and Udenu in Enugu State have been set ablaze by unidentified persons.\n\n\u201cLast Sunday, 16th May 2021, our state office in Enugu suffered yet another arson and vandalism in which parts of the building were ransacked and several vehicles razed. And more of our facilities are being systematically targeted and attacked. Just last night, Tuesday 18th May 2021, two more offices in Ebonyi and Ezza North Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State were burnt down.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, although no life was lost, the damage to the physical infrastructure and electoral materials was total.\n\n\u201cNothing has been salvaged from ballot boxes and voting cubicles to generating sets and office furniture and equipment.\n\n\u201cSurely, these attacks are no longer freak events but appear to be quite orchestrated and targeted at INEC. Clearly, these are acts of unjustifiable aggression, which may undermine the commission\u2019s capacity to organise elections and dent the nation\u2019s electoral process,\u201d he added.\n\nYakubu said the facilities of the commission were there to serve the local communities in exercising their franchise, adding that targeting such important national assets and repositories of electoral materials that took time and enormous resources to procure cannot be justified.\n\nHe said: \u201cReplacing these facilities in the prevailing economic circumstances will indeed be a tall order, thereby adversely affecting electoral services in the same communities. These facilities are not only limited to voting but also used for other critical electoral activities such as voter registration, the coordination of stakeholder engagements and voter education and sensitisation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the commission will work with the security agencies to deal with the perpetrators of these heinous crimes in accordance with the law.\n\nYakubu added that the meeting with RECs will take briefings from across the country on threats to INEC facilities and deliberate on how best to protect them.\n\n\u201cI believe that we can dig deep and draw from the commission\u2019s longstanding partnership with communities in this regard, in addition to depending on the invaluable support of our security agencies.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the challenges posed by these threats notwithstanding, we are still positive that we can find lasting solutions to the spate of attacks on our facilities,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe explained that this must be done quickly to forestall disruptions to upcoming electoral activities, particularly the continuous voter registration billed to hold in 2,673 centres nationwide for over one year.\n\nHowever, he said that on the positive side, the commission conducted 28 out of 32 by-elections across the country since the 2019 general election, in addition to four end-of tenure governorship elections in Bayelsa, Edo, Kogi and Ondo States.\n\nAccording to him, the commission must reconcile itself with the fact that elections have become an all-year round undertaking in Nigeria.\n\nIn addition to the by-elections, he said INEC successfully concluded stakeholder engagements on the expansion of voter access to polling units.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am glad to inform you that the option of converting existing voting points and voting point settlements into full-fledged polling units and situating them in the most agreeable locations to support increased voter access was overwhelmingly accepted by Nigerians. Consequently, the commission has, in the last three weeks, concluded the actual exercise as well as the verification of the newly established polling units.\n\n\u201cIn the next few days, the commission will meet to finalise the compilation and coding of polling units and thereafter make the information public.\n\n\u201cAs you are also aware, our current strategic plan covering the period 2016-2021 expires at the end of this year. Consequently, the committee set up by the commission to develop the 2022-2026 strategic plan has concluded its work, the validation of which will commence this week.\n\nHe also said that INEC had completed preparations for the resumption of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) commencing on June 28.\n\nYakubu stated that preparations for the Anambra State governorship election, to be held on November 6, and the FCT Area Council election scheduled for February 12, 2022, will be prioritised.\n\nSimilarly, he said INEC would continue the early preparations for 2023 general election.\n\nAccording to him, the commission has already established an Election Project Plan (EPP) Committee to work on the 2023 election plan, with the aim of completing the plan early enough and ensuring that INEC is fully ready for the election.\n\nHoodlums Set Ablaze Two INEC Offices Burnt\n\nMeanwhile, two offices of the commission in Ebonyi State have been set ablaze by hoodlums.\n\nThe two INEC offices are located at Ezza North and Ebonyi Local Government Areas of State.\n\nIt was gathered that the hoodlums invaded the two separate offices in the early hours of yesterday and set them ablaze, resulting in the destruction of sensitive and non-sensitive documents.\n\nEbonyi State Governor, Chief David Umahi, who confirmed the incidents, said some of the security challenges in the state were politically motivated.\n\nUmahi stated this when the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 9, Umuahia, Abia State, Mr Etim Ene Okon, visited the state to address the ongoing insecurity in the state.\n\nEtim decried the insecurity, especially kidnapping, cultism, banditry among others.\n\n\u201cThe most annoying part of the insecurity is the incessant killing of police officers, burning of their stations and making away with their arms and ammunition\n\n\u201cStakeholders should call those responsible for the hideous crime to order because they are from your different communities of the state,\u201d Etim said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Assures foreign investors of stable fiscal policies\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday urged European nations and international financial institutions to grant debt relief to African countries.\n\nHe also gave an assurance that Public-Private Partnership (PPP) will be fully explored to ensure more precision in development, cutting down waste and reducing chances of corruption.\n\nIn addition, Buhari urged investors to further explore vast opportunities of human and natural resources in Nigeria, while assuring them that fiscal policies will be more favourable, predictable and measurably tilted towards creating a harmonious business environment.\n\nThe president, in his presentation at the Financing Africa Summit, held in Paris, with the theme: \u201cExternal Financing and Debt Treatment,\u201d called on European countries and global financial institutions to consider reducing the devastating effect of the Coronavirus pandemic on the African economies.\n\nThis, he said, could be done by restructuring debt portfolios, opting for complete relief, and releasing vaccines to the continent, which is still behind in protecting majority of its citizens.\n\nAccording to him, fall in commodity prices as COVID-19 took a toll on the global economy has further slowed growth in some countries and strained health facilities.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is in this vein that we solicit the support of the French government with its influence in the European Union to lend its voice to the efforts being made to mobilise additional resources for developing economies, most especially Africa in order to strengthen the quantum of investments to our economies. This financial support should also be extended to the private sector.\u201d\n\nThe president said the European Union should encourage fair and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines in less developed countries, and promote the establishment of manufacturing facilities.\n\nBuhari stated that many African countries are already experiencing debt distress and the Debt Service Suspension by France and G-20 does not go far enough.\n\nHe added that there was need for more sustainable and affordable financing solutions, including debt relief and further debt restructuring.\n\nOn the Paris Agreement for Climate Change, the president stated that African countries would need financial support for green energy investment and COP-26, adding that Nigeria will refocus on gas while adopting a Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative.\n\nBuhari, while also speaking on the theme of \u201cAfrica Private Sector \u2014 Reforms \u2013 Infrastructure\u2019\u2019 said Public-Private Partnership (PPP) would be fully explored to ensure more precision in development, cutting down waste and reducing chances of corruption.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe government intends to leverage on Public-Private Partnership to bolster its job creation, and anti-corruption drive. In terms of job creation, Nigeria has an abundant labour force since 30.5 per cent of its population is between the ages of 25 and 54.\u201d\n\nBuhari, at another occasion in Paris, urged investors to further explore vast opportunities of human and natural resources in Nigeria, while assuring them that fiscal policies will be more favourable, predictable and measurably tilted towards creating a harmonious business environment.\n\nThe president spoke when he hosted Chairman of Total, Patrick Pouyanne; Executive Vice President, AirBus, Silvere Delaunay; Chairman of the Board of a software company, Daussault Systems, Florence Verzelen; Chairman/CEO of General Engineering and Marketing of Telecommunications Operator, Francois-Regis Teze and Chairman/CEO, Donaflex Automotive, Dr. Donatus Nwokoye.\n\nAt the meeting with the delegation from Total, Buhari said the outlook and potential for growth in the country remained steadily positive and affirmed the government\u2019s commitment to scale up operating standards and policies that encourage mutual benefits.\n\nHe said: \u201dWe are very pleased with the evolving trends in technology, which is currently driving development across the world and Nigeria. Nigeria is more a gas country than a crude oil-producing country. In the 80\u2019s we generated more from gas, than crude oil. In the \u201980s, we were earning more from gas for some years and had put in place structures. We intend to further explore the gas sector. I am pleased with your consistency in staying in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe urged investors to take advantage of the natural and human resources in Nigeria, saying that the demographics favour development, with more young people who are eager to be gainfully engaged and trained.\n\nThe president thanked Pouyanne for the company\u2019s consistency and expansion in Nigeria since 1956, assuring him that the government will enhance fiscal stability to favour investors.\n\n\u201dWe need to educate the youth and encourage more skills in technology. Technology has been most impactful in all sectors, including the oil and gas, which has witnessed a rapid transformation in exploration, processing and distribution,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, said Total had confirmed long-term investments in Nigeria and had consistently exceeded targets in gas production.\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC has designed solutions to some of the challenges in the oil and gas sector, particularly on tax.\n\nPouyanne told the president of the readiness of the company to stay in Nigeria, and to further expand interest in oil, gas, solar and other commodities that will directly impact the lives of citizens.\n\nHe said investors had been eagerly waiting for the passing of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as it would send a strong signal of more predictability.\n\n\u201cTotal is very committed to Nigeria. We have no intention of leaving Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari also yesterday met with the President of Ethiopia, Sahle-Work Zewde, who came to brief him on the regional security and political situation in the Horn of Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi state, says the south-east region does not want to secede from Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) are both campaigning for the secession of the south-east from Nigeria.\n\nIPOB was formed in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu while MASSOB was founded in 1999 by Ralph Uwazuruike.\n\nUmahi spoke at the presidential ministerial press briefing organised by the presidential communications team at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja, on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governor said though some of the agitations of the youth in the region are \u201crightful\u201d, they have been hijacked and become violent.\n\nUmahi, who is also the chairman of the South-east Governors Forum, said despite the security challenges plaguing the south-east, the region does not want any form of war but wants to be part of a peaceful Nigeria.\n\nThe governor said he believes in dialogue and called on aggrieved groups to come forward to air their grievances and demands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe situation in the South East is a mixture of reality, fake news and war propaganda. Are there rightful agitations in the Southeast? Yes. Has it turned violent? Yes. It\u2019s been hijacked,\u201d Umahi said.\n\n\u201cIn the southeast we don\u2019t want war, we don\u2019t want to secede, we want to be a part of a fair Nigeria where justice, equity and freedom exist.\n\n\u201cI have offered, and all the south-east governors\u2026present your demands, embrace and renounce and hand over to us.\n\n\u201cThere is no region in the country today that does not have one thing or the other against the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut we have not sat down to discuss and that is what we are demanding from our youth, whether banned or barred, let us hear your grievances. Give us six months to engage the federal government to address all these.\n\n\u201cI believe in dialogue, I believe we can sit as people, discuss and find what our differences are and we can also, together, discuss how we can strengthen our cooperation as a people.\u201d\n\nOn the two offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that were razed in the state, Umahi condemned the action, describing the reason behind the incident as \u201ca terrible mindset\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been brainwashed about Biafra; that there will be no elections in the region in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cINEC offices are not being burnt in other parts of the country. It\u2019s a terrible mindset for anybody to be doing this. They are criminals.\u201d\n\nThe governor also condemned the mayhem in the region, adding that Ebube-Agu, the south-east security outfit, has come to stay.\n\nHe asked the security operatives in the region to intensify efforts in curbing the security challenges in the region.\n\n\u201cEbube Agu is a change of name. My state has signed our Ebube Agu into law and it has come to stay. It is to protect the people. Once you are not a criminal, you are safe,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo matter what name you bear, you are banned or barred and causing trouble in the south-east, Ebube Agu will address that with the security agencies.\u201d\n\n\u2018BAN ON OPEN GRAZING RIGHT DECISION\u2019\n\nUmahi said those against the southern governors\u2019 resolve to ban open grazing want killings to continue in the country.\n\nAbubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, had argued against it, saying the plan is equivalent to prohibiting spare parts trading in the north.\n\nBut Umahi said those against the southern governors\u2019 resolve misunderstand the situation.\n\nAccording to him, the south has no grazing routes, and allowing cattle to move freely would mean trespassing on people\u2019s property,\n\nHe, therefore, asked the federal government to implement ranching and business models for livestock management.",

A month later, he appeared in a recorded video although the military said the person in the video was an imposter.\n\n\u2018Killed\u2019 again in September 2014\n\nThe Nigerian army announced a year later that the Boko Haram leader had been killed by Cameroonian troops in the frontline. The Cameroonian military also confirmed the claim but the photos they released, claiming to be those of the dead Shekau, were widely disputed.

As usual, it never ended there: Shekau released an audio message that month announcing that he is alive.\n\nThe last official information on Shekau\u2019s fate was in August 2016 when the Nigerian Air Force said he had been \u201cfatally wounded\u201d in airstrikes.\n\nThe spokespersons of the Nigerian army and police have been contacted for response regarding the latest development.\n\nMeanwhile, in the intelligence report shared by TheCable, the police requested the military \u201cto bomb the ISWAP members who just occupied Sambisa forest.\u201d",

          "title": "Many people have one concern: NITDA warns Nigerians against digital colonialism as Whatsapp\u2019s new privacy policy takes effect",
          "text": "Whatsapp has been more subtle about telling users to sign new terms of service but NITDA says some dangers remain\n\nIn January 2021, users of the popular instant messaging app Whatsapp got notifications about new terms of service and an updated privacy policy. The notification came with the warning that if users did not accept the new terms by February 8, they would lose access to the app.\n\nWhen you\u2019re one of the world\u2019s most popular apps and owned by Facebook, a company many people distrust, that sort of announcement will hog headlines. There\u2019s also the fact that many tech users are becoming concerned about privacy and the kind of data apps collect about them.\n\nSo for a few weeks, we saw articles suggesting that people should switch to apps like Telegram and Signal, which do not collect as much information on their users. As a result, Signal saw a rush of downloads.\n\nAlthough the pushback was intense, Whatsapp did not budge on its terms and privacy policy; instead, it decided to soft-pedal on the new terms of use and be more subtle about getting users to sign it.\n\nWhatsapp still wants you to agree to new terms\n\nIn the weeks leading up to a new deadline of May 15, Whatsapp began sending reminders to users as an in-app notification. While it will no longer block users from using the app if they don\u2019t agree to the new terms, it will restrict some functionalities.\n\nThe company said in a blog post in May, \u201cfor the last several weeks, we\u2019ve displayed a notification in WhatsApp providing more information about the update. After giving everyone time to review, we\u2019re continuing to remind those who haven\u2019t had the chance to do so to review and accept. After several weeks, the reminder people receive will eventually become persistent.\u201d\n\nWhatsapp is swapping its forceful method and wants to send reminders until users agree. Yet, countries are still concerned, and in Nigeria, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NIDTA) issued a statement Tuesday about Whatsapp.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp users are at liberty to decide on giving consent to the processing of their data based on the new privacy policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) recognises; we have consent (a clear, unambiguous expression of privacy terms communicated by the controller and accepted by the Data Subject) as one of the lawful basis for data processing. Acceptance of the new privacy policy and terms of use implies that users\u2019 data would now be shared with Facebook and other third parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers will now be subject to the terms and policies of Facebook and other receiving entities with or without being direct subscribers to such services.\u201d\n\nNITDA is wary of new policy\n\nAt the heart of the new terms, Whatsapp wants to become a place where businesses directly sell to customers. Small businesses will have virtual storefronts, while bigger businesses will be able to integrate Whatsapp into their existing technology stack.\n\nIn a statement, NITDA published some portions of Whatsapp\u2019s new policy\n\nOne concern many people have is whether Facebook will have access to their Whatsapp chats, but the company insists that messages on the IM platform are encrypted end-to-end. Yet, NITDA says users should \u201climit the sharing of sensitive personal information on private messaging and social media platforms as the initial promise of privacy is being overridden on the basis of business exigencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNITDA is exploring all options to ensure Nigerians do not become victims of digital colonialism,\u201d the agency added in its statement.\n\nIt is not clear what these options are. For now, the choice ultimately lies with users who will determine how to guard their privacy as WhatsApp\u2019s new rules go into effect.",

          "text": "Moses Francis has had a heart-breaking Wednesday. Looking at his Binance app, every graph is red. He holds four coins \u2013 Tron, Doge, Litecoin and Ripple. They have been bleeding value all day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been holding for over a year now. I\u2019ve come across a lot of dips. But I haven\u2019t encountered one as bad as this,\u201d he says to TechCabal.\n\nFrancis is not alone. In Nigeria, thousands of users have felt burned on a day of massive slumps in value of virtually every notable cryptocurrency traded across the globe. \u2018Bitcoin\u2019, \u2018Binance\u2019, \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 and \u2018Crypto\u2019 are among top trends on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin is the hardest hit \u2013 the value has crashed as low as $32,000 from a previous high of $65,000 in mid April. But the wave has shaken BNB, Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency, as well as Ethereum, the currency of the NFT world.\n\n\u201cI am feeling down. Anytime I open Binance, I feel as though I want to purge,\u201d says Ogechukwu (he gave just his first name) who has held Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.\n\nMany reacted to the crash by choosing to see the funny side.\n\nBitnob, a Lagos-based cryptocurrency exchange, had a request for Risevest, a stock and real estate investment startup.\n\nHi @Risevest are you hiring?\n\n\n\nWe dey find work \u2014 Bitnob (@Bitnob_official) May 19, 2021\n\nSomeone imagined the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s governor must be feeling good about his crypto warnings earlier in the year. (\u2018Ponzi\u2019 also became a top trend in Nigeria).\n\nEmefiele looking at all these crypto tears pic.twitter.com/mN3ve6CVGL \u2014 Editi Effi\u00f2ng (@EditiEffiong) May 19, 2021\n\nBut the jokes do not mask the pain of the dip\u2019s strokes. Victor Asemota, a Nigerian businessman and startup investor, lamented in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI take it back. Crypto is now worse than equities. I have lost all my gains this year and the last in a few hours.\u201d\n\nIndeed Bitcoin has now lost all of the gains made since February 8, the day Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its highly-demanded cars. In the three months since, BTC rose steadily.\n\nThat rising tide drove up the value of other currencies. The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody.

          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAs our interview drew to a close I asked her what dreams and goals she had. \u201cEssentially, I just want to be happy\u2026\u201d This was how she began her answer.\n\nThe other part of her answer that stuck with me was her plan to sell natural hair wigs to \u201cblack women everywhere.\u201d\n\nWith her business Natural Girl Wigs, she now ships to black women in over 65 countries.\n\nWe talk about growing up in Lagos and falling in love with her hair. Her story takes us from building a community on social media to later growing a successful tech-enabled business with that same community.\n\nHer name is Oluremi Martins-Areola and this is her life in tech.\n\nIt\u2019s all about hair. Black hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a very interesting view of my hair.\u201d\n\nMany Nigerian millennials remember where they were when Agbani Darego won the Miss World Pageant in 2001. I remember a lot of rejoicing on my street when the announcer said \u201cMiss Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFor Oluremi, the pageant was one thing to be excited about but Darego\u2019s iconic hairdo would be the thing with the lasting influence.\n\n\u201cMy father would indulge me during the weekends and take me to go do the Agbani Darego style,\u201d she said.\n\nBy Monday she had to return to whatever hairstyle her secondary school had assigned. But for those weekends, Oluremi\u2019s hair could do whatever she wanted it to.\n\nShe went on to study history and diplomatic studies at the University of Lagos but for her, deciding on what to study was not something she had bothered about too much.\n\n\u201cIt was actually never about what I was going to study. I always knew that school would be a stepping stone to whatever I wanted to achieve. I felt I was going to go into some type of media or doing a business that had an impact so I felt like it was okay to do anything in school.\u201d\n\nWhile at the university, she became active on social media and started learning about digital marketing through online courses. This would help her land a job as a social media manager for a consulting firm right out of school.\n\nShe changed jobs a few times before finally working at Image Boosters, a digital agency where she would begin to form the idea for her business.\n\n\u201cIt was a personal awakening for me because I had this beautiful natural hair and anytime I wanted to buy wigs or protective styles it was always these European or Indian weaves.\u201d\n\nOluremi\u2019s business started with an Instagram page where she built a community of black women who wanted to care for their hair but also get access to wigs made just for them.\n\n\u201cI thought, why shouldn\u2019t I have wigs that look like my natural hair\u2026\u201d\n\nShe soon began selling wigs sometime in 2018 and eventually left her job after six months of running the Instagram account.\n\nLooking back on her decision to leave paid employment and face her business full time, Oluremi tells me it was tough. She had just gotten a promotion that came with more money and deciding to leave at that time felt scary.\n\nBut by the end of her first year, she had made revenue of up to six figures in dollars \u2013 and she hadn\u2019t even set up her website yet. Her dream of reaching black women around the world was slowly starting to take shape.\n\nBuilding Natural Girl Wigs\n\nBefore the pandemic, Oluremi already ran a remote workforce. Save for the actual making of the wigs, there was no need for her staff to be physically present for anything. She counts this as one of the reasons the pandemic didn\u2019t disrupt her business too much.\n\nNatural Girl Wigs is currently in its third year. After making impressive sales in the first year, it became important for the company to have its own solutions available on a website and not just a social media account.\n\nThe business now caters to black hair in different ways. Of its features, The Hair Quiz stands out. With the quiz, customers are able to answer questions about their hair and are provided with recommendations on hair care and products.\n\nThe website also provides hair tutorials and content tailored to black hair.\n\nOne of the toughest parts of running an e-commerce business anywhere in the world today has to be logistics. To ease the strain of shipping to one of her biggest markets \u2013 the U.S. \u2013 Oluremi had to start manufacturing the wigs in the U.S. as well.\n\n\u201cLogistics is a serious challenge we\u2019ve faced. We currently work with a third party entity that handles delivery for us.\u201d\n\nWith Natural Girl Wigs now delivering to countries all over the world, Oluremi points out how a community was key to growing.\n\n\u201cThe theme for the initial Instagram page was just me posting things around beauty and lifestyle to a great community of people that would be interested in the product I was going to launch.\u201d\n\nThe community has continued to grow and Natural Girl Wigs currently has close to 60,000 email subscribers.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nFor Oluremi, the future for Natural Girl Wigs involves scaling manufacturing. A lot of the materials being used are currently being imported from China and other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen I was doing my research, I realised that most of the manufacturers of hair are Chinese or Asian and a future I would like to explore is one where I have a factory where we make hair from scratch in Africa.\u201d\n\nAway from work, there are a few things Oluremi enjoys: hanging out with her husband, going to restaurants, attending events in Lagos. She hopes to continue to do these things that make her happy.\n\nShe would also like to help people realise the paths to their own goals and dreams.\n\nWhether through her Instagram videos on growing your business or any other medium she may use soon, Oluremi is keen on letting people know that it\u2019s never too late to go for the things they want because as she puts it, \u201cwhenever you wake up is your morning.\u201d",

          "text": "Ntisa Limited, a cloud technology company that builds software applications for small businesses today unveiled ntisa, a retail management solution aimed at automating and eliminating the challenge of business record keeping confronting most small business owners.\n\nSpeaking at the product unveiling event, Ifeanyi Amah, founder and Chief Strategist of Ntisa limited revealed that the \u201cntisa brand is a result of the discovery of the challenges faced by most small businesses who had challenges serving their customers during the lockdown period of COVID 19\u201d. According to him, \u201cit was clear that there was a gap in the market, and the challenge was how to find a solution to bridge that gap for the good of the business owners\u201d.\n\nNtisa is a brand built by Nigerians with strong global expertise. The word \u201cntisa\u201d in Igbo means to disrupt which underlines the brand essence which is to \u2018scatter\u2019 the old inefficient way of doing things by replacing that with modern technology-driven methodologies to help business owners better organize their operations to grow customers and become profitable.\n\nNtisa, as a retail management solution, will address significant concerns of business owners such as daily record keeping, management of stock, tracking of delivery and customer relationship management. Thus, the ntisa platform has multiple interfaces that can serve the needs of various types of small businesses including restaurants, grocery shops, boutiques, logistics/courier companies, toy and drinks and any other specialty of small retail business.\n\nSpeaking on the concept of Ntisa, Ifeanyi said \u201cwe set out to create an affordable, very easy to use and ubiquitous solution for every small business\u201d. We believe that simple and powerful can co-exist without the need for expensive hardware which means that any smart device is good enough to operate ntisa.\n\nEmphasizing the origin of the brand alongside the conceptualization, Ifeanyi says we took cognizance of our environment in developing ntisa and it resulted in the development of a product that allows our customer to utilize our solution even in remote areas without broadband or internet access. This is possible because the system can operate offline when there is no internet until they can have access to synchronise.\n\nOur claim of a retail solution is drawn from the quality of the features of ntisa for consistent management of retail processes across any channel, taking businesses digital to thousands of merchants by publishing any company on the platform and their products on the ntisa e-commerce mobile App that is available for Android-based and Apple (IOS) mobile phones. Ntisa also maintains a 360-degree view of customer orders and payment while simplifying retail operations using common user-friendly features.\n\nBased on the heritage of the visioner of the business, ntisa was inherently designed to ensure that the security of the platform as well as data privacy are built-in in line with global best practices.\n\nIfeanyi informed that ntisa is an enabler of business growth with the report and analytics feature that provides valuable insights to customers and store performance with the opportunity of customized integration to other platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram as well as e-commerce portals of businesses that already have one.",

          "title": "ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo Review: The Rebirth of an Incredible Multitasking Laptop for a Mobile User.",
          "text": "In a world where you either evolve or you die, ASUS\u2019 \u201cIn Search of Incredible\u201d brand spirit puts them ahead of the pack as it can be seen by how ASUS has done incredibly well to find a way to rebirth the ZenBook Duo series for a much more improved user experience and performance. The new ZenBook Duo 14 is an ASUS second-generation dual-screen laptop comprising of a second display called the ScreenPad Plus, which stretches across the top of the keyboard. Just like its predecessors the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 (UX482) is revolutionary, unique and impressive device that ensures productivity on the go for design professionals like graphic artists, illustrators, photographer, video editor, music artist or even a business user.\n\nASUS ZenBook Duo 14 (UX482) Geek Specs\n\nIntel Core i7-1165G7 processor (4 cores, 8 threads, 2.8 GHz @ 4.7 GHz)\n\niGPU Intel Iris Xe 96 EUs\n\n32 GB LPDDR4X onboard\n\n1 TB NVME M.2 SSD\n\n14\u2033 FHD NanoEdge Touch Screen display features incredibly slim 4 mm bezels\n\n12.6 \u201cTouch ScreenPad Plus 1920 x 515\n\nNew ErgoLift AAS plus (Active Aerodynamic System) hinge design\n\n1 x USB 3.2 type A\n\n2 x USB-C Thunderbolt 4\n\n1 x HDMI\n\n3.5 mm mini jack\n\nWebcam\n\nMicroSD card reader\n\nWi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0\n\n70 Wh battery\n\nWeighs 1.6 kg and is 16.9 mm slim\n\nVibrant Dual Displays\n\nThe dual display arrangement of the ZenBook Duo 14 is not an overkill. It is a joy to have. ZenBook Duo 14 gives you a superbly immersive viewing experience, with a four-sided frameless NanoEdge display that\u2019s super-bright \u2014 up to 400 nits \u2014 and has ultraslim bezels for an expansive 93% screen-to-body ratio. The ScreenPad Plus display now has a maximum brightness of 400 nits for better visibility at any angle. The 1W panel option draws a single watt of power at 150nits of brightness for extended battery life, while offering a clear and bright image of up to 400nits at full brightness.\n\nPANTONE\u00ae Validated and T\u00dcV Rheinland Eye Care certification \u2013 The displays of the 2021 ZenBook Duo 14 are PANTONE\u00ae Validated to provide the most precise colour accuracy, and it features Low Blue light modes and Anti-Flicker technology. It is also TUV Rheinland-certified for low blue-light emissions, so it\u2019s comfortable to use for long creative sessions.\n\nEvolved ZenBook Duo design\n\nThe design of the ZenBook Duo 14 just like its predecessors is a stunning piece of engineering and art. The device housed with magnesium aluminium alloy chassis and aluminium alloy lid with a nicely brushed texture with the ASUS trademark concentric circles pattern etched across the top, along with the shiny silver Asus logo on the celestial blue finish for a premium feel. The ZenBook Duo (UX482) is designed to have enough external connectivity ports that are rarely found in a high-end laptop these days. On the left we find an HDMI out and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports that use the USB Type-C port. ASUS has installed a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a microSD reader and a USB-A port on the right. The ZenBook Duo 14 compared to earlier versions is also lighter and more portable. You can open it anywhere for work.\n\nNew Hinge Design\n\nThe new hinge design of the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 (UX482) makes all the difference. This new design solves two issues that the ZenBook Duo series has \u2013 the first one being thermals as the ZenBook Duo series had the ScreenPad Plus stuck onto the main body, and blocked off the largest surface area for cooling. Secondly, it made the ScreenPad Plus tilt, solving user\u2019s feedback about its ergonomics. The new hinge module not only allows the ScreenPad Plus to lift up, and the laptop itself to lift itself from the desk for better thermal efficiency and visual experiences. Now, you don\u2019t have to move your body to look at the ScreenPad as it tilts upwards automatically when the laptop is opened.\n\nEvolved ScreenPad Plus\n\nOne feature that makes the ZenBook Duo 14 distinct is its new 12.6\u201d ScreenPad Plus that sits directly below the 14-inch main display. Last year ASUS released the unprecedented ScreenPad Plus on the first-generation ZenBook Duo, providing a solution that gave users the ultimate edge in workflow and multi-tasking efficiency. Now, the ScreenPad Plus display\u2019s AAS Plus new hinge design allows it to lift up slightly by up to 7 degrees as you open it for improved airflow. The slight lift also makes the ScreenPad plus look more like it\u2019s a seamless continuation of the top screen.\n\nAAS+ for Improved Airflow \u2013 As the ZenBook Duo 14 laptop opens, the secondary display rises up for a better view while also opening a massive intake for up to 49% higher airflow courtesy of the unique Active Aerodynamic System (AAS+) which makes the ScreenPad Plus an integral part of the cooling system. The new AAS Plus design helps to sustain the performance users need for multi-tasking and to tear through light content creation workflow.\n\nNew ScreenXpert Control Center \u2013 ASUS has also optimized its ScreenPad Plus software quite impressively featuring a brand-new Control Center UI making it easier than ever to navigate the ScreenPad Plus. There\u2019s a new App Explorer shortcut that shows you everything running on your system, and allows you to quickly swap programs between screens. You can turn on gestures that let you flick apps across the screens as well, though I found those to be a bit more frustrating than using the shortcuts that pop up as you\u2019re dragging windows. Those let you quickly push an app to the other display, or maximize them across both screens.\n\nTouchpad Mode \u2013 The ScreenPad\u2122 Plus now offers a Touchpad mode. Once you enable it on the settings page, simply tapping the ScreenPad\u2122 Plus turns it into the largest touchpad you can find on a laptop. To close it simply tap the X icon at the top right corner of the ScreenPad.\n\nEvery Creators Dream \u2013 The ScreenPad Plus interface can adapt to the application at hand. For example, in Adobe Lightroom, it can show Lightroom\u2019s developer\u2019s panel so the editor can splash the photo onto the main display. It currently works best with Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, Lightroom and After Effect with more on to come.\n\nImproved Connectivity\n\nThe ZenBook Duo 14 has enough external connectivity ports that are seldom found in a mainstream laptop these days. For easy connections to peripherals, the ZenBook Duo 14 (UX482) features two Thunderbolt\u2122 4 USB-C ports, with up to 40 Gbps of data bandwidth and up to 8K display output, along with USB 4.0 support. In addition, the 2021 ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 also offers a full-size HDMI port, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A port. This makes it possible for the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 to easily output to a projector, monitor or TV, connect to storage devices or expand connections, all without dongles or adapters.\n\nLearn More: https://www.asus.com/wa/Laptops/For-Home/ZenBook/ZenBook-Duo-14-UX482/\n\n#ASUSZenbookDuo14 #ZenbookDuo14 #ASUSZenbook #ZenbookDuo",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "[SPONSORED] ASUS unveils the latest dual-screen laptop series \u2014 ZenBook Duo 14 (UX482)",
          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nThe ASUS range of laptops has shown me that style can meet performance but with the ASUS 2021 ZenBook Duo 14, you can get everything you need in optimum laptop technology. This device comes with a wide range of new features and key upgrades on features we are already familiar with across the board.\n\nExceptional Look and Feel\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a device with a cool and sophisticated finish, ASUS 2021 ZenBook Duo 14 is what you should watch out for. It comes in a distinct interior that creates more efficient functionalities; some of which comprise an ErgoLift, an AAS plus hinge, along with numerous high-performance components.\n\nAnother feature that makes the device a true beauty is the minimalist design and setup. For one, the ASUS 2021 ZenBook Duo 14, though built with more top-end components, is smaller and lighter in size. It weighs only 1.6 kg and is 16.9 mm slim, which is 50gr lighter and 3 mm slimmer than the previous version.\n\nImproved ASUS ScreenPadTM Plus\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the ScreenPadTM Plus. The ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 comes with a screen upgrade; something to really get you curious as to how it was done and how it would work. The engineers keyed into the perception that most laptop users like to multi-task hence why they cracked the code of creating 2 screens in one device \u2013 the Main Display Screen and the ScreenPad Plus. While the Main Display screen can flip to 120 degrees, the ScreenPad Plus is 12.6 inches in size, 400 nits in brightness, and elevates at a 7-degree radius, giving you the chance to view both screens at the same time when working on both displays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this won\u2019t be possible without the hinge. This laptop comes with a Zinc Alloy Hinge which enables both the Main Screen and the ScreenPad to move seamlessly. That\u2019s made possible through the 3-linked structure that enables the laptop have a better thermal efficiency and unique visual experience. This hinge is 30% smaller than the previous ASUS ZenBook version and this makes this current laptop 3mm smaller.\n\nOne of the best things you will enjoy about the ScreenPad is the ScreenXpertTM Control Center which gives you the ability to minimize tasks on the task bar seamlessly. The Control Center can also be manually adjusted to sit in any position on the screen and can also be customized to include more buttons \u2013 all at your preference. Some of the features you\u2019ll see on this Control Center include Brightness Control, App Navigator, Task Swap, Activate Touchpad, Task Group, Link to MyASUS, Keyboard Lock, and Settings. Did I also mention \u2013 the ScreenPad also comes with a Handwriting feature that recognizes handwritings and transcribes it to typed text.\n\nImproved Ventilation\n\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 has been designed to increase airflow by 49%; that makes it more than the previous versions. One reason is the hinge which makes the screen better elevated; another reason is the Active Aerodynamic System (AAS+) which makes the touchscreen responsible for the improved cooling system. The improved ventilation system makes it possible for you to use your laptop for as long as you desire without the laptop wearing out.\n\nThe thermal functionality of the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 is another reason why it can barely ever heat up. When you open your laptop for use, you can see the new thermal design that accommodates 2 blades each with 59 blades and a wider heat pipe at \u00d810mm that improves airflow.\n\nFrameless Display\n\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 also features a 14-inch FHD display bound by 4mm NanoEdge bezels \u2013 one of the slimmest edges you\u2019ll ever come across which also gives you a screen to body ratio of 93%. It also comes at a maximum brightness level of 400 nits as well as PANTONE validation for colour accuracy. With all of these, your eyes are safe as the device passed the TUV Rheinland Eye Care Certification.\n\nStronger Wi-Fi\n\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 features the Wi-Fi Master technology as it possesses an in-built Wi-Fi 6 for faster network transmittance and also a Wi-Fi SmartConnect feature which gives you a strong network connection from longer distances, with reduced fluctuations, and seamless work experience.\n\nAIPT \u2013 The Secret to Performance\n\nWhat makes the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 boost its CPU Power Settings from the standard 15W to 28W? it\u2019s clearly the ASUS Intelligent Performance Technology (AIPT) component which it possesses. This feature adjusts power consumption according to loading status and temperature such that your laptop works effectively given any kind of workload and temperature. The AIPT also comes with smart sensors that not only possesses AAS Plus for heat dissipation but also possesses smart sensors that detect any form of heat within any part of the device real-time and adjusts the power consumption output to prevent any form of overheating.\n\nA Webcam with The Perfect Position\n\nOne other thing that makes the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 a device worth using is its webcam and that\u2019s obvious as 76% of laptop users use webcams at least once a month. This key component stands at a top bezel position and supported with a bottom-mounted camera to give you the perfect view whenever you use it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurprisingly, this webcam is ultra-thin but possesses a 4-element lens, giving you sharper images as well as lower noise in the graphics and resolution. It has an Advanced Infrared feature embedded in to enable you to be seen when using the webcam in a dark place. This IR component also possesses a facial recognition technology that enables you login to the device with just your face; even at dark spots.\n\nAmazing Audio\n\nThe audio system of the new ZenBook Duo 14 has been carefully tuned by experts from the ASUS Golden Ear team and certified by audio specialists Harman Kardon to ensure the very best sound for all kinds of content. The dual speakers of the ZenBook Duo 14 are driven by a dual-channel \u201csmart\u201d amplifier that allows the maximum volume possible while preventing long-term damage to the sensitive voice coils of the speakers. It also possesses an AI optimized noise cancelling functionality which works best when you\u2019re having a virtual meeting in a noisy environment. This feature doesn\u2019t allow anyone to hear the noise within your location whenever you stream.\n\nMyASUS \u2013 Your reliable guide\n\nThis device, like any other ASUS spec, gives you unrestricted access to the MyASUS portal where you can ask any questions and access any kind of resources online about how to use your device and achieve the best results from it. MyASUS is accessible 24 hours of the day and the support responds real-time.\n\nCutting-Edge Specifications\n\nThere are a lot of things that speak for the distinctness and functionality of the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 which also proves that it\u2019s a device you need to have around you. Here are some key facts you must know about the device:\n\nCPU: The laptop comes in 11th Gen Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 processors, particularly at Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7-1165G7 and Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i5-1135G7 both of which possess AIPT sustained TDP boost to 28W as opposed to other devices which come at 15W. The new processors improve modern creative workflows with Intel\u00ae Deep Learning Boost AI acceleration and AV1 media encoding and decoding technology.\n\nHigh Speed Memory: The ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 supports up to Up to 32 GB LPDDR4X 4266MHz and fast 4266 MHz LPDDR4X clock speeds to provide plenty of processing power.\n\nDisplay: In addition to the NanoEgde functionality, the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 also possesses a 14-inch FHD anti-glare touchscreen with 100% sRGB colour gamut and 400nits brightness level.\n\nHigh Speed SSD: The device comes with up to 1TB PCle 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD.\n\nGraphics: The NVIDIA GeForce MX450 component of this device gives you a crisp and clear look and feel. In addition, it\u2019s capable of accelerating workloads as well as faster, smoother gaming and content creation. It also works seamlessly with NVIDIA\u00ae Optimus\u00ae technology to give you the perfect balance between long battery life and performance.\n\nPorts: Accessibility is one of the key benefits you get from using the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 as it comes with 2 x Thunderbolt\u2122 4 USB-C (of up to 40Gbps), 1 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1 x full size HDMI 1.4, 1 x 3.5mm audio jack, 1 x microSD card reader, Intel\u00ae Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s hope to vaccinate 70 percent of its over 200 million population has been dealt a further blow, with India, supplier of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines to COVAX suspends exportation till the end of 2021.\n\nThe decision of the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of vaccines, to halt supplies to the World Health Organisation (WHO) scheme was announced on Tuesday as part of India\u2019s effort to concentrate more resources on fighting the rage of the deadly COVID-19 variant rocking the country currently.\n\nIndia\u2019s coronavirus infections crossed 25 million as daily death toll hit a record high.\n\nThe move also further highlights the consequences a nation like Nigeria has to face for failing to build its own capacity to produce vaccines for its people.\n\nNigeria is currently a beneficiary of the WHO-coordinated COVAX facility as the AstraZeneca vaccine doses currently being distributed in the country are sourced from the SII.\n\nAfter supplying roughly 4 million out of 16 million doses expected from COVAX, the institute has now delayed deliveries to other countries till year-end, casting uncertainty on the future of vaccination in Nigeria.\n\nRoughly 2 million vaccine doses, half of the initial consignment received, have been administered already under the first phase. Disruptions in the supply might elongate the interval required between the administration of first and second doses of AstraZeneca and affect efficacy.\n\nExcept for states such as Lagos, where second vaccine doses have been earmarked from initial allocation, many states that have exhausted their consignments are likely to be stranded.\n\nRead Also: Combining Astrazeneca vaccine with Pfizer dose boosts higher antibodies: Study\n\n\u201cSII has delivered more than 200 million doses,\u201d the Serum Institute said Tuesday in a statement posted to its Twitter account. The company said that in the past few days, there had been \u201cintense discussion\u201d on the decision of the Indian government and vaccine manufacturers about the possible export of vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe continue to scale up and prioritise India,\u201d the company said, saying, \u201cWe also hope to start delivering to COVAX and other countries by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nBattling the world\u2019s biggest jump in coronavirus infections, India halted vaccine exports a month ago after donating or selling more than 66 million doses.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest economy has already started exploring other options outside India, with 29 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine expected through the African Union.\n\nThe National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) on Tuesday granted an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the single-dose COVID-19 vaccines developed by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.\n\nSupport is also likely to come from the US under a fresh commitment to donate a significant number of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX scheme for distribution to poorer countries.\n\nA total of 20 million doses of the Pfizer Inc, Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be sent by the end of June, apart from 60 million AstraZeneca doses already planned for donation, Joe Biden, US president on Monday.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Gayle Smith, the US global coordinator on COVID said the US was also planning to increase its funding for COVAX, in addition to $2 billion which she said it had already donated to the facility.",

A witness who spoke to us at the court premises said Mendis was stabbed several times by a South African woman and her husband from Zimbabwe, whose daughter sold a phone to Uzodimma.\n\n\u201cApparently, the daughter of the woman, who is alleged to be an online porn artiste, sold her phone to our brother, who in turn sold it to another person who saw the porn movies where the girl featured and started circulating them,\u201dhe revealed.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhen the girl got it, she thought it was the person she sold the phone to who circulated it not knowing that he was not the one as he had sold off the phone.\n\n\u201cSo, it was out of fury that the lady, her mother, and her mother\u2019s husband stormed Mendis\u2019s shop. Without hearing from him, the mother started stabbing him until he slumped and died.\u201d\n\nNgwoke added that already two witnesses had testified to ensure that justice was served.",

Yes. Has it turned violent? Yes. It\u2019s been hijacked.\n\nAdding that, In the Southeast, we don\u2019t want war, we don\u2019t want to secede, we want to be a part of a fair Nigeria where justice, equity and freedom exist.\n\nGov Umahi further gave a brief background of the post-1999 situation in the Southeast, from MASSOB to IPOB to ESN.\n\nShedding more light on the rationale for Ebube Agu security network: \u201cA regional security cooperation based on the vigilantes we have always had, to protect the people.\u201d\n\nGovernor Umahi: \u201cI believe in dialogue, and that we can sit down to know and resolve our differences and strengthen our cooperation as a people.\u201d\n\nGovernor Umahi also spoke about some of the programmes of his administration in Ebonyi State: Agriculture (\u20181 person 1 hectare\u2019 program for public servants; Fertilizer), Transport, Microcredit, Women empowerment, Medical Sciences, Infrastructure, etc\n\n\u201cEverywhere you turn in my state is a construction site. 95% of our construction projects in Ebonyi State are done by direct Labour, so there is no capital flight, most of the money stays in the State.\u201d\n\nGovernor Umahi says Ebonyi is developing three (3) industrial Agriculture clusters \u2013 comprising land, warehouses, biomass energy supply, factories, and mills (for processing rice, cassava, etc).\n\nGovernor Umahi lent his voice on the issue of the Farmers and Herders clash, by saying, \u201cOur law in Ebonyi is that if you attack farmers or herders and destroy their farmlands/cattle, you must pay compensation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the issues of succession, he stated, \u201cA lot of people have been brainwashed about Biafra; that there will be no elections in the region in 2023. INEC offices are not being burnt in other parts of the country. It\u2019s a terrible mindset for anybody to be doing this. They are criminals.\u201d\n\nGov Umahi endorsed the ban on open grazing, says it\u2019s the right decision, especially in Southeast which does not have historical grazing routes/reserves. Calling on the Federal Government to do more to enforce implement ranching & business-led models for livestock management\n\nGov Umahi on roads: We are building roads to ensure that there is no part of Ebonyi State that cannot be accessed from an LGA HQ within 40 minutes. Building roads is an important part of development. And we don\u2019t care which ones are Federal or State roads.",

          "text": "A committee of the Nigeria Governors Forum has recommended a petrol price of between N408.5 per litre and N380 per litre.\n\nThe committee, which is headed by Governor Nasir El-Rufai called for the immediate removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nEl-Rufai, in presenting the report of the committee explained that the current subsidy regime was unsustainable because smugglers and illegal markets in neighbouring African countries were the beneficiaries.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria, like other Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries member countries, agreed to a cut in production to keep the prices high but that Nigeria could not fully benefit from the regime because of subsidies.\n\n\u201cBetween N70bn and N210bn is estimated to be spent every month to keep gasoline price at N162 per litre. This is below the cost price and the remittance to the federation account will shrink to less than N50bn per month or even zero if threats persist.\n\n\u201cWe are already at zero. I understand for tomorrow, so this scenario has occurred.\n\n\u201cWhy are we keeping the price at N162? We are keeping the price because the Federal Government and trade unions met and agreed to the suspension of some industrial action months back.\n\n\u201cEven though we all supported deregulation of petroleum products prices last year, this agreement was suspended by the Federal Government because of a threat of industrial action by unions.\n\n\u201cThis is the root of the problem and now we are back to losing between N70bn to N210bn per month.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that in the 2021 budget the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation had committed to remitting a minimum of N120bn per month to the federation account, but it had been unable to do so.\n\nWhile presenting the recommendation of the committee about the price of petrol, he further explained that only about 12 states consumed two-thirds of the petrol, which was heavily subsidised.\n\nThe committee recommended N408.5 litre as the appropriate price in the circumstance but that with concessions to labour unions, N380 per litre could be the minimum.\n\nEl-Rufai stated, \u201cThe committee recommends PMS pump price increment from the current N162per litre to N408.5 per litre (negotiations with organized labour unions). N380per litre (settlement with organized labour).\u201d\n\nThis, he said, was necessary to free funds for critical projects and payment of other obligations.\n\nOther governors who contributed to the debate included Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State who said the 93 million litres which the NNPC claimed was consumed in Nigeria daily was unacceptable.",

We have an existing structure. As for tiers of government, we have \u2013 Federal, State, and Local Governments.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cThose clamouring for restructuring, what have they done to ensure the functionality and efficiency of the local government.\n\n\u201cHere we have a governor clamouring for restructuring and denying a local government (which is a tier of government) the financial resources to function effectively,\u201d he said.\n\nThe AGF, therefore, said the governors cannot demand restructuring of the country noting that there is no justification for it.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be clamouring for restructuring in a system whereby you have a responsibility to allow the existing tiers of government to operate.

          "text": "Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai has backed out of a scheduled meeting between the federal government, state officials as well as officials of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) saying none of the state officials will attend the meeting.\n\nThe governor said he is yet to see evidence that the NLC is backing off from its campaign of economic and social sabotage against the people of the State.\n\nMr El-Rufai stated this on Wednesday in a statement signed by his media adviser Muyiwa Adekeye.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government is yet to see evidence that the NLC is backing off from its campaign of economic and social sabotage against the people of the State,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cElectric power is yet to be restored, after it was shutdown at dawn on Sunday, 16th May 2021, in brazen violation of the laws protecting essential services and infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThat action removed any basis for state government officials to meet the NLC last Sunday. Denying our people electricity about 18 hours to the advertised commencement of their organised sabotage was akin to putting a gun on the government\u2019s head. Government has a lawful duty not to indulge blackmail.\n\n\u201cRestoring electricity is vital to relieving some of the pain that needless acts of lawlessness have inflicted on our people. The unimpeded provision of essential services is vital to civilised order.\n\n\u201cThose who have disrupted it should promptly reverse themselves, not expect that it will be a matter for negotiation, much less being viewed as a precondition. KDSG will not participate in such a negotiation or countenance one whilst our people are still being denied their right to electricity.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige on Wednesday waded into the ongoing face-off between the northwestern Kaduna State government and labour unions by inviting both parties to a reconciliation meeting.\n\nIt\u2019s been three days since the NLC started a demonstration resulting from the disengagement of more than seven thousand civil servants by the Kaduna State government.\n\nSeveral sectors of the state\u2019s critical economy have been paralysed following the protests with governor El-Rufai in reaction declaring the NLC president and other leaders wanted for economic sabotage and attacks on public infrastructure.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
