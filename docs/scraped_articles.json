          "title": "Southern Govs should stop ganging up, issuing threats to get 2023 Presidency \u2013Shekarau",
          "text": "Former Governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, has said that the 17 Southern Governors should stop \u201cganging up\u201d and \u201cissuing threats\u201d to get the 2023 Presidential slot.\n\nShekarau, who represents Kano Central District in the Senate, stated this on Monday while featuring on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 breakfast programme monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress chieftain said that the next President after the incumbent, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), should come from the Southern region of the country to give \u201ca sense of belonging\u201d to every Nigerian.\n\nHe also noted that the APC should zone its presidential ticket to a capable and credible candidate in the South in the next election which is about 18 months from now.\n\nThe two-term governor and former Minister of Education, however, knocked the Southern Governors for \u201cganging up\u201d to demand Presidency in 2023.\n\nAs the 2023 general elections draw nearer, there have been intense political posturing, permutations and fireworks. The 17 Southern Governors had met twice in the year and demanded power shift to their region while the 19 Northern Governors also met last week, opposing such move and noting that the candidate with the highest votes will emerge as President in the next general elections.\n\nSpeaking on the television programme, Shekarau lamented that it was very unfortunate that the issue of zoning has degenerated to a point where democracy has been reduced to \u201cregional gang-up\u201d.\n\nThe Senator knocked the Southern Governors for their various meetings and \u201cgang ups\u201d, saying they should desist from instigating other groups in the country from making similar demands that would heat up the polity.\n\nHe said that the Southern Governors should make intra-party consultations and discussions, rather than make public declarations.\n\nShekarau said, \u201cAs far as the party I belong is concerned, the APC, my proposal is that now that President Buhari is from the northern part of the country and (after) he has done his eight years, let beam the searchlight to the southern part of Nigeria, not because we don\u2019t have competent people in the north\u2026that does not mean you are throwing away the issue of competence, credibility and so on.\n\n\u201cWhile I agree we should go for the best and therefore throw it open, regardless of which part of the country, but we must also be mindful of the aspect of the sense of belonging. We must be mindful of perception, to give some sense of belonging to every part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhere I disagree with the Southern Governors is coming together to gang up to say it must be our turn. I think this is purely a party affair.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cWe must not do this at the point of threat, that it must be me, it must be he, we need to come together. This is more of a political party issue.\n\n\u201cMy point of disagreement with the gang up groups like the Southern Governors is coming to gang up to say it must be our time, this is wrong, it is purely (a) party issue and the political parties should go into the boardrooms and sort this issue out themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, the Southern Governors gang up, tomorrow, another group would gang up and say it must be us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGovernors are very prominent people in the scheme of things, they are leaders, so, they must be careful coming together to make some pronouncement that would amount to instigating the general public to take a stand and see it as a regional fight,\u201d Shekarau added.",

          "title": "Vehicles stranded on Ado-Akure road as travellers spend hours on 30km stretch",
          "text": "The frustrations being experienced by users of federal roads in Ekiti area of the federation have come to the fore.\n\nOur correspondent reports that on Friday, travellers were stranded along the Igede-Aramoko-Efon Road on account of the bad stretch of the roads.\n\nAdo-Ilawe-Igbara-Oke and Ado-Ikere-Akure roads didn\u2019t fare better, as commuters were also stranded on the roads due to the number of trucks plying it, in addition to the poor state of roads, which worsened commuters\u2019 experience.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Federal Road Maintenance Agency, Femi Bamisile, said that the N460bn budgeted for construction and maintenance of federal roads in the 2021 budget and the N30bn allocated to FERMA have not been having positive effects on Nigerian roads.\n\nThe National Assembly member spoke at Aramoko Ekiti, Ekiti West Local Government Area of Ekiti State while addressing some angry travelers on Saturday.\n\nOur correspondent reports that all roads, both state and federal, in Ekiti State which had become the routes for North and South-bound trucks in recent times, leave commuters spending three to four hours on the dilapidated 30-kilometre distance, in addition to becoming death traps and kidnapping zones.\n\nBamisile said, \u201cI have moved round Ekiti and what I saw are disturbing. This situation is unfortunate and we have to find solutions to it.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that a bridge got cut off at Jebba and these heavy trucks from the North and South now find Ekiti as the most convenient place to ply and that has further caused serious damage to both federal and state roads.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cThe Federal Ministry of Works got N460bn in the 2021 budget and N30bn was allotted to FERMA. This is too small for a body saddled with the maintenance and rehabilitation of roads across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigerians cannot be treated this way. There should be a serious reform in the way our federal roads are being maintained. Let all the monies being allocated be structured accordingly, so that Nigerians can be rescued from this mess.\u201d",

          "title": "Evans Akere: Innovating African Traditional Wear",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nSince launching his fashion line, Creative Director and CEO of Vanskere, Evans Akere, has become one of the major brands saddled with the responsibility of making African traditional wear acceptable worldwide.\n\nA lawyer by training, his passion and love for fashion, has made his home-grown brand a premium lifestyle brand for men. Renowned for its obsession with craftsmanship, the basic goal Evans says has always been to make stylish and comfortable clothes, a major factor for the brand\u2019s success so far.\n\nWith a clientele list that boasts of politicians, corporate executives and A-list celebrities, Vanskere continues to bridge the market gap for classic, yet, in-trend occasion wear garments tailored for today\u2019s man. Here, he talks about switching from law to the needle profession, the birth of his latest Afro-Athleisure collection- Signore Fusion by Vanskere, (a collection inspired by the COVID19 lockdown) that is now a brand on its own, challenges in the industry and the Nigeria of his dreams.\n\nYou read law in the university, at what point did you embrace fashion?\n\nThat was when I was studying law. I found out that something was not right. I found it difficult to fit in as a law student because I was too elaborate in my dressing. Back then, as a law student, you had to dress corporate in black and white but I like to express myself in my dressing. I like colours.\n\nI remember when I was in law school during my compulsory court attachments, I was actually walked out of court by a Senior Advocate because of the way I was dressed. I wore a purple shirt and a purple tie to court. The judge wanted to take it up that I will not graduate from Law School. I never practiced law or went to court.\n\nI finally made up my mind to do fashion after my call to the Bar. I did not practice.\n\nHow did the VANSKERE brand come to be and how has the brand evolved over the years?\n\nThe VANSKERE brand came to be as a result of my love for fashion. Although I was trained as a lawyer, my passion for fashion supersedes that of law, which made me abandon law. VANSKERE is an abbreviation of my first and last name. It was my nickname from my teenage days. So when it was time for me to set up, it was only logical that I registered the name as the brand name.\n\nThe brand has evolved over the years from a basic fashion brand, to a Luxury fashion brand, with emphasis on modern African traditional wear.\n\nWhat have been your weirdest sources of inspiration for your brand and design direction?\n\nLike I have always said, inspiration is divine, it\u2019s indescribable, and it comes naturally. For an artist, anything can be a source of inspiration. For me, my weirdest source of inspiration has been from lines, curves, and angles.\n\nThe Vanskere brand is fun, but there is also a classic appeal to your apparel. How do you strike an appropriate balance between classic and contemporary?\n\nIt has been easy striking a balance between classic and contemporary fashion because we understand the brand, its core value, and target market. We know it\u2019s imperative that we maintain and sustain our conservative nature, while also meeting the needs of our fashionable customers.\n\nWhat would you consider the biggest challenge as a fashion entrepreneur?\n\nMy biggest challenge from day one has always been how to manage my tailors. In Nigeria, there is a lack of efficient tailors, the few available ones are either not loyal or are badly behaved.\n\nHow have you managed this problem over the years?\n\nManaging tailors is a big challenge like I said, the majority of them are not loyal. If you are lucky, you might have one or two who are, but majority of them are not. It\u2019s more challenging when you have a big factory with many of them; you\u2019ll need to be strong mentally and physically to survive each day. Even when you have a factory manager, majority of the issues still end up on your table.\n\nTo stay above board, I see it as a business hazard that I have to endure daily. So, I\u2019m prepared and ready to face them when I come to work each day.\n\nYou have worked in the fashion industry for quite some years now, what is the best lesson you have learned along the way?\n\nMy best lesson so far would be never to design clothes that suit only my personal style.\n\nHow would you describe the fashion industry in Nigeria today? What would you say are the challenges and way forward?\n\nThe industry has definitely grown over the years, more Nigerians are beginning to appreciate locally made clothes and this has increased the level of patronage. The majority of Nigerian designers have stepped up their game, creating beautiful designs with impeccable finishing. But, there is still a lot of work to be done for our clothes to get that global recognition like we see in the music and movie industry.\n\nThere are lots of challenges in the industry, one of the major one, is lack of a steady power supply; without electricity we can\u2019t produce. A lot of the money we make is spent on buying generators and maintaining them, funds that should have been ploughed back into the business. We don\u2019t even have the enabling environment for business growth and expansion. Basic infrastructures are not available. We do not have textile industries, everything we use including the fabrics are imported. There are no colleges of fashion, only a few institutions offer fashion designing as a course. I could go on and on, but I think the way forward would be for our government to invest in the industry and create an enabling environment.\n\nThe fashion industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. How has the pandemic impacted the Vanskere brand? What was your strategy for staying afloat during the lockdown?\n\nThe pandemic did hit hard on almost every business, but we thank God that the impact wasn\u2019t so hard on the Vanskere brand. We realised that it wasn\u2019t business as usual; we were in an unusual time, so we needed to do the business in an unusual manner. We started off by making face masks for individuals and later scaled up to companies. The sales from the face masks were unbelievable, we couldn\u2019t believe how much we made from it. Then came the easing of lockdown measures; we discovered that most companies were working remotely, while the majority of their staff were working from home. There were no parties and events. Based on this, there was a decline in the purchase of clothes. Then the idea came from our PR team to create comfortable and more casual clothes that could be worn indoors while working and outdoors when socialising. This idea gave birth to the Afro-Athleisure collection under the auspices of our diffusion line \u2013 Signore Fusion by Vanskere. The collection became a huge success and this has become one of our best business decisions in a while. As a result, Signore Fusion is now a brand on its own.\n\nWhat do you love most about what you do?\n\nEverything, I love everything about fashion. I like to study and predict trends; I love to sketch designs and shop for fabrics. I also like to play a major role in the production aspect of the designs.\n\nWhat do you think makes one a successful fashion designer?\n\nI think what makes one a successful fashion designer is the ability to manage change. As a designer, you must have the ability to envisage change, dictate and move with trends.\n\nTell us a bit about your growing up years and what informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nI was born in Edo State. I had my primary and secondary education in Benin-City. My Dad was a successful lawyer, so I wanted to be like him, this made me study law at the university. He indirectly influenced me to study Law. As a young boy growing up, there was this tendency to be like him. But along the line, I realised I was destined to be a designer, but that didn\u2019t make me drop out of school. I completed my law programme before pursuing my passion for fashion. I came to Lagos for my Law school programme, after which, I stayed behind to establish the Vanskere brand. A few years later, I felt the need to have a formal education in fashion, so I went to London to study at the London College of fashion.\n\nDescribe a day in the life of Evans Akere\n\nI start my day with prayers, then go to the gym if its my workout day. I go back home to freshen up and have breakfast, after which I get to work. I work long hours so I get home quite late. I usually look forward to going home to my family after a long day at work. My routine is quite seamless \u2013 I wind down by watching some news channels. If I am inspired, I create new designs, if not, it lights out.\n\nMen do not always pay attention to the way they dress. Give some advice on how to be stylish?\n\nMy advice will be to wear clothes that fit. Men should not shy away from bright colours, the era of wearing only dull colours is long gone. Dress for the occasion and keep accessories to a minimum.\n\nWhat are some of your biggest dreams that you are yet to fulfill?\n\nThat would be making Vanskere a complete African fashion and lifestyle brand.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside work?\n\nI am a huge football fan, I enjoy watching and analyzing the game. I like listening to music. I also like to watch good movies and read books.\n\nWhat is next for Vanskere?\n\nThe next phase is to make the brand more accessible worldwide.\n\nAre you looking to design for ladies in the future?\n\nSure, it is something we are looking into.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you take time out to relax?\n\nI stay indoors and watch good movies and work out. I am what some would term an \u201cintrovert\u201d, but I cherish my time out with my family. I work really hard, so I don\u2019t joke with family vacations. I take out time every year to go on holiday.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nThat would be Dubai. It\u2019s an ideal holiday destination, with luxury hotels, theme parks, and loads of activities.\n\nNigeria will be celebrating her independence anniversary soon, with all that is going on, do you think there\u2019s a reason to celebrate?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is any reason to celebrate, but we have every reason to be grateful. At least, we are not experiencing a civil war, despite the challenges. Nigeria is still better than Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a country where you\u2019re free to be the very best and productive that you can be, irrespective of your tribe and religion. A country where hard work is rewarded and people do not steal from each other to get rich. Lastly, a prosperous nation where every Nigerian will live in dignity.",

My routine is quite seamless \u2013 I wind down by watching some news channels. If I am inspired, I create new designs, if not, it lights out.\n\nMen do not always pay attention to the way they dress. Give some advice on how to be stylish?\n\nMy advice will be to wear clothes that fit. Men should not shy away from bright colours, the era of wearing only dull colours is long gone. Dress for the occasion and keep accessories to a minimum.\n\nWhat are some of your biggest dreams that you are yet to fulfill?\n\nThat would be making Vanskere a complete African fashion and lifestyle brand.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside work?\n\nI am a huge football fan, I enjoy watching and analyzing the game. I like listening to music. I also like to watch good movies and read books.\n\nWhat is next for Vanskere?\n\nThe next phase is to make the brand more accessible worldwide.\n\nAre you looking to design for ladies in the future?\n\nSure, it is something we are looking into.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you take time out to relax?\n\nI stay indoors and watch good movies and work out. I am what some would term an \u201cintrovert\u201d, but I cherish my time out with my family. I work really hard, so I don\u2019t joke with family vacations. I take out time every year to go on holiday.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nThat would be Dubai. It\u2019s an ideal holiday destination, with luxury hotels, theme parks, and loads of activities.\n\nNigeria will be celebrating her independence anniversary soon, with all that is going on, do you think there\u2019s a reason to celebrate?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is any reason to celebrate, but we have every reason to be grateful. At least, we are not experiencing a civil war, despite the challenges. Nigeria is still better than Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a country where you\u2019re free to be the very best and productive that you can be, irrespective of your tribe and religion. A country where hard work is rewarded and people do not steal from each other to get rich. Lastly, a prosperous nation where every Nigerian will live in dignity.",

          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nAs Nigeria gets set to celebrate her 61st independence anniversary on Thursday, 1st October, Nigeria\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Diaspora Comission (NIDCOM), Hon Abike Dabiri Erewa in this exclusive interview, speaks on some salient issues currently plaguing the country.\n\nThe former House of Representatives Member, who was one of the most vocal voices, especially on the issues of women and children, also opens up on the place of women in politics today, her role and challenges as head of NIDCOM, the issue of migration and of course, the Nigeria of her dreams.\n\nNigeria will on October 1, turn 61 as a nation. At a time like this, do you think there is anything or reason to celebrate?\n\nOf course, there is every reason to celebrate; that we are alive today, that we have a country, and I tell you, it is a country to be proud of. There are challenges no doubt, but we must look at our strengths, rather than our weaknesses. We should look at what unites us rather than what separates us. So, yes, Nigeria is not where it should be at 61, but gradually, we will get there. But it\u2019s not about government alone, it is about every one of us, at home and in the diaspora, working together to build this great country of ours.\n\nMany Nigerians who trusted your party the APC to bring about change and move them to the next level have had their hopes dashed, with many opting to migrate to other countries. How can hope be rekindled again?\n\nI don\u2019t know what you mean by the situation in Nigeria, what we encourage is, you can migrate. You can\u2019t stop migration, legal or illegal. But, try to avoid irregular migration. And also, when you are in another man\u2019s country, it is important that you try to obey the laws of that country. In the UAE for instance, we are bombarded every day with complaints that UAE is not renewing work permits. But we went to see the UAE Ambassador, and he made it clear that there is no official policy from the UAE government about not renewing work permits. But Nigerians are still being denied work permits. In this situation for instance, it\u2019s a case of the bad now affecting the good.\n\nWhen you are in another man\u2019s country and you go to rob a bank in broad daylight in a place like UAE, I condemned it and I listed the names of the four Nigerians who committed the crime. I was criticized for mentioning their names. People felt it was because they were from a particular section of the country, but when you are out there, you are seen as Nigerian first before any tribe.\n\nThis is a country with laws and zero tolerance for crime. Now those guys are serving life imprisonment. In the same UAE, our brothers took cultism there, and they were killing themselves openly. We have seen a lot of things happen and now the bad is affecting the good.\n\nSo what I am telling Nigerians in UAE that are being affected now is, you go out there condemn bad behaviour. Let it be known that those few do not represent who we are as a people. But when you sit down there and you don\u2019t call out those who do these things, then, the bad will definitely affect the good. But I am hoping that the issue of the UAE can be dealt with at the ministerial level, not at my level. However, UAE has said that there is no official policy on the issue.\n\nIn UAE and in other countries, no Nigerian will be allowed to be treated anyhow as instructed by Mr. President and we\u2019ve had a lot of interventions.\n\nBut NIDCOM does not deal with consular issues, it is basically the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that deals with consular issues. So, in terms of being treated anyhow, once you don\u2019t commit a crime, we will intervene. But you cannot commit a crime, or break the laws and expect that we are going to beg for you.\n\nThe economic situation in Nigeria has made Nigerians endure indignities in different countries across the globe. How easy or difficult has this home situation made your work as head of NIDCOM?\n\nThis question is general. I\u2019ll take specific cases. In South Africa with the issue of xenophobia, Mr. President intervened himself, it was dealt with.\n\nWe dealt with the issue of Traders in Ghana and the President also sent a delegation.\n\nThe issue of Libya, and Nigerians languishing in Libyan detention centers for years, Mr President set up a committee headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to go into detention camps in Libya. We brought thousands of Nigerians back. But guess what, despite all that, people are still going. We need massive awareness campaign. In Lebanon for instance, we brought stranded Nigerians back and one of the girls said to me \u201cI will rather be selling guguru (popcorn) under the bridge than go back there.\u201d\n\nSo, I think if people know that where they are running to is worse than where they are running from, they will have a rethink.\n\nWhat can be done to stem the rise of abuse of Nigerians by their host country?\n\nAny Nigerian, if you are unjustly abused, we will definitely intervene. We have intervened on many occasions. We will not allow you to suffer for a crime you didn\u2019t commit, period. We work with the missions to ensure that no Nigerian is treated unjustly and we also reject stereotyping of Nigerians. If A commits a crime deal with it, don\u2019t say because A committed a crime, you punish B for that because he is a Nigerian. That is not going to happen. We as Nigerians must reject that stereotype.\n\nBut, please, if you don\u2019t obey laws in your own country, you can\u2019t go to another man\u2019s country and disobey. It is as simple as that, but we have definitely been intervening in cases where Nigerians have been affected. Many of them are not even in the media. When we get complaints, we work directly with the missions and a whole lot of times, we get results.\n\nNigeria hasn\u2019t been this divided since Independence, and fingers point at what is generally regarded as poor leadership at the center. What do you make of it?\n\nLeadership has its own role, followership also has its own role. So, let\u2019s look at it holistically. I think as a people, what are our values? What are our morals? What are the things that matter to us? So, I look at it holistically, yes, leadership is a problem, but so is followership. There has to be better participatory democracy, and for the elites in particular who sit back and say \u201coh, I won\u2019t get involved,\u201d to know it is wrong. It is also important for the citizens to demand the best of their leaders.\n\nDo you share the growing notion that Nigeria may cease to exist if current multifaceted problems are not addressed urgently?\n\nI hope not because, Nigeria will emerge strong, but it has to be a united Nigeria, where merit counts, where it doesn\u2019t matter who you know or where you come from and one that will expose the best of your potentials.\n\nI believe that the kind of democracy, or system of government we are practicing now is not meant for us, but we are in it. What do we do to make it better? There has to be devolution of powers to the local and state levels. The strongest arm of government should be the local level. What would the federal government be doing with education in a local community like Imota for instance? I believe in devolution of power. Let powers devolve to the local level, and at that stage, you can have the very strongest in the community head the local government. I mean that is what federalism should be about. The kind of system we are operating now is not working for us, and will not not work for us until we take certain measures and that rests with the National Assembly. The National Assembly needs to look at both the exclusive and concurrent list in the constitution and review them such that more powers go to the local government. If you have a strong local government that is empowered and funded, we will solve a lot of problems.\n\nWhat would you say are the challenges you face as head of NIDCOM and how do you overcome them?\n\nThe greatest challenge is funding, you know it is a new agency, but we don\u2019t let that stop us. We are trying to work on gathering data but Nigerians abroad don\u2019t want to share their data. But we are working at building trust and confidence of Nigerians abroad knowing that it helps in planning.\n\nWhat do you think are some of the ways to help a country like Nigeria help itself, and relieve some of the pressures for emigration?\n\nMr. President is concentrating a lot on infrastructural development, creating the kind of environment where jobs can be created. This is what government is doing under the office of the Vice President, to encourage small businesses and startups. Although not everybody is looking for a job, because from the experience I have had, even if you have the jobs, there are some people who just believe that their destiny is abroad. Why would somebody that has three trailers, sell them for about 10 million naira, decides that he wants to relocate to Europe, gets stuck in Libya and then, comes back with nothing? We need a lot of awareness. It is not rosy out there. Go to the streets of Greece and see Africans including Nigerians, just roaming about; no jobs, they can\u2019t even speak the language and then, they are hawking and not selling anything. Like the lady from Lebanon said, she is better off selling guguru (popcorn) somewhere.\n\nUnfortunately, the kind of education that we are providing is not making graduates startup on their own. So, the government has a role to play, but we also have our own roles to play too in letting that young person know not to fall victim of traffickers. So, a lot has to be done by government and us, but you can\u2019t stop migration. If I am below 30 and I find opportunities abroad, of course, I am going to go.\n\nSince your time at the National Assembly, female legislators have not been very vocal. What is happening with the women?\n\nI don\u2019t think women in the parliament are less vocal. There is a bill in place now to create over 100 seats dedicated to women and I think it was sponsored by Hon. Nkiruka. So I don\u2019t think women are less vocal, they are less in number. When I was in parliament, we were 27; but now, I think they are just half the number both in the House and the Senate. Also, there are less women in political space in terms of leadership. We need to work at making it better.\n\nHow far would you say women have come in terms of politics, since independence?\n\nWe can do better and beyond tokenism which is what the two major parties- APC and PDP are doing now. You know there is no level- playing field, so, I encourage women, If you want a change, you need to leave your comfort zone and be part of politics. I don\u2019t mean you have to contest elections, just let your voices be heard. I started at the local level, attending ward meetings, before I decided to contest elections. If you know it is in you, you need to venture out to succeed.\n\nHowever, there are some cultural issues that still make it difficult for women in politics. But we can\u2019t give up, more women need to participat. So, join a political party, be a leader in your community, go to your ward level, get to know the grassroots, mingle with them, and get to know what is going on. The more women you have in the system, no matter what anybody says, when you give them a task, they deliver.\n\nYou are obviously a very busy woman when you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nI like to be home and to spend time with my family. I love music so I like to sing and dance. Music relaxes me and I try to exercise but a lot of times, you get to lazy to do it. But yes, home is my comfort zone and music relaxes me.\n\nWhen it comes to fashion does your office determine your style? What are you more comfortable in?\n\nThe occasion determines what I wear. I wear what suits me, but of course you know I love Nigerian attires. I remember a lot of times when I travelled, I always bought skirts, suits and trousers; not anymore. Maybe one or two for some occasions. I do love,our Nigerian outfits, and a whole lot of times that I travel, sometimes, I don\u2019t come back with them because somebody likes them and has to take them.\n\nSo, I wear what I feel comfortable in. I believe you can be simple and elegant.\n\nAre you looking at contesting for any political position sometime soon?\n\nWell, right now, I am chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and it has been very challenging setting up a new commission and dealing with millions of Nigerians all over the world. I think my key thing now is just to succeed on the job and set a solid structure on the ground. The future will take care of itself.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dream?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a strong united Nigeria; a Nigeria where it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, who you know, where merit will be our watchword, where you progress because you are good and where your potentials will not be buried. I dream of a free, fair, equitable Nigeria, a Nigeria where poverty will be absolutely and totally reduced, a Nigeria where everybody can live comfortably, where the rich will not be getting richer and the poor getting poorer and a Nigeria where corruption will be totally gone.\n\nOne of our major problems is corruption and corruption is from top to bottom. We just have to tackle that cankerworm called corruption. Having a corrupt-free Nigeria is the only way we can make progress.\n\nAnd then, civil service reforms are quite important; otherwise, the business of government will be difficult.",

But yes, home is my comfort zone and music relaxes me.\n\nWhen it comes to fashion does your office determine your style? What are you more comfortable in?\n\nThe occasion determines what I wear. I wear what suits me, but of course you know I love Nigerian attires. I remember a lot of times when I travelled, I always bought skirts, suits and trousers; not anymore. Maybe one or two for some occasions. I do love,our Nigerian outfits, and a whole lot of times that I travel, sometimes, I don\u2019t come back with them because somebody likes them and has to take them.\n\nSo, I wear what I feel comfortable in. I believe you can be simple and elegant.\n\nAre you looking at contesting for any political position sometime soon?\n\nWell, right now, I am chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and it has been very challenging setting up a new commission and dealing with millions of Nigerians all over the world. I think my key thing now is just to succeed on the job and set a solid structure on the ground. The future will take care of itself.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dream?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a strong united Nigeria; a Nigeria where it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, who you know, where merit will be our watchword, where you progress because you are good and where your potentials will not be buried. I dream of a free, fair, equitable Nigeria, a Nigeria where poverty will be absolutely and totally reduced, a Nigeria where everybody can live comfortably, where the rich will not be getting richer and the poor getting poorer and a Nigeria where corruption will be totally gone.\n\nOne of our major problems is corruption and corruption is from top to bottom. We just have to tackle that cankerworm called corruption. Having a corrupt-free Nigeria is the only way we can make progress.\n\nAnd then, civil service reforms are quite important; otherwise, the business of government will be difficult.",
          "summary": "So, yes, Nigeria is not where it should be at 61, but gradually, we will get there.\nI don\u2019t know what you mean by the situation in Nigeria, what we encourage is, you can migrate.\nI don\u2019t think women in the parliament are less vocal.\nSo I don\u2019t think women are less vocal, they are less in number.\nI dream of a free, fair, equitable Nigeria, a Nigeria where poverty will be absolutely and totally reduced, a Nigeria where everybody can live comfortably, where the rich will not be getting richer and the poor getting poorer and a Nigeria where corruption will be totally gone.",

          "title": "Mmekidmfon Umanah\u2026Building a healthcare bridge between Europe and West Africa",
          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nWith Africa\u2019s healthcare system on the brink of collapse, Nigerian born UK based Mmekidmfon Umanah, is on a mission to strengthen the West African frontline and primary healthcare system via his project company; Aimcare Health Limited a product sourcing company that is building the healthcare bridge between Europe and West Africa by connecting European health startups to the unique market opportunities in West Africa.\n\nA Chevening alumnus with an MSc in International Development from the University of Birmingham, with an incoming PhD in Business and Management candidate at the King\u2019s College London, Mmekidmfon also serves as the Executive Director of WaterEase Organization, a nonprofit using resource mobilisation and advocacy to help underserved communities have better access to clean water in Nigeria.\n\nSo far, through his advocacy work, four communities in have been provided with clean water, with a community in Bauchi as the latest beneficiary.\n\nMmekidmfon shares his motivating factor and overall mission for his work.\n\nWhat is the motive behind the creation of Aimcare? What inspired it?\n\nThe truth is that the African healthcare system is simply broken, and this cost me my mother\u2019s life in 2013. For 80% of people in Africa, their community pharmacy and patent medicine stores are the frontlines of their health system and, yet they routinely stock out of essential medicines, incur significant losses to expiry, and struggle with substandard and falsified drugs and medical consumables. Where immunizations, contraceptives, anti-infectives, essential devices, and diagnostics, or chronic-care at the local clinic or pharmacy are expired, too expensive, or simply unavailable, providers, patients, and whole communities pay the price; we are currently working to prevent these. . Hence, I am committed to tackling this issue through Aimcare, working our way up from just inventory access and financing to infrastructure financing.\n\nWe are ensuring that consumers have access to the best and most innovative products in the market regardless of their location or economic status.\n\nAnd how do you go about achieving your goal?\n\nAimcare Health Limited\u2019s mission is to strengthen the West African frontline and primary healthcare system by providing pharmacies, primary healthcare centres, patent medicine stores and hospitals with the most innovative, user-friendly, and affordable products in the global market. We are currently doing this by connecting global health start-ups to unique and high-potential opportunities on the African continent. We focus on non-clich\u00e9 opportunities in the healthcare ecosystem from piloting disruptive technology to marketing innovative consumer products and wearables. By leveraging on our unique partnership channels, we have built access to 1000 pharmacies, 200 patient medicine stores and 50 clinics.\n\nDot Glasses is one of the foreign start-ups we are working with. We are their sole partners in Nigeria and we are enabling the facilities as listed above to get access to this affordable yet quality vision care solution.\n\nHow is Aimcare financed?\n\nAimcare is a for-profit startup and primarily we make money from our services. For a while, people used to erroneously think we are a non-profit, and possibly this came from the fact that we are involved with a lot of impact projects. For instance, we have a project that involves distributing birth kits to pregnant women in rural communities through the traditional birth attendant homes and distributing hygiene kits to boarding secondary schools. The reality though is that these projects are now part of our non-profit vehicle\u2019s (Waterease) value proposition and no more Aimcare directly.\n\nAt what point did the Dot Glasses project come in and what informed it?\n\nAimcare currently has an exclusive partnership with a Czech based company called DOT Glasses, tell us about it?\n\nDOT Glasses is a Czech-based vision Care Company that has developed proprietary on-spot testing that allows us to test, diagnose and provide our customised prescription lenses on the spot all in less than 4 minutes for a total cost of $4. DOT Glasses is the first sustainable solution to the world\u2019s vision problem. With their patented, snap-together, adjustable frames designed by a subsidiary of Mercedes Benz; Impact and scratch-resistant lenses; simple proprietary vision testing tools; and extraordinarily robust 100% injection-molded ABS plastic, they ensure the end-user has access to quality prescription lenses at an ultra-affordable rate.\n\nTell us your achievement with DOT glasses project in Nigeria?\n\nFrom inception to-date we have sold about six thousand five-hundred DOT glasses and partnered with some non-commercial partners like Akwa Ibom State government and the Ini Ememobong Foundation to distribute 500 for free. We have in the process provided eye tests for one thousand people. We\u2019ve partnered with the government and private companies to distribute 7000 pairs of these glasses since March this year\n\nFrom all you have done, your projects seem to focus more on the northern part of Nigeria, why is that so and when are you extending to other parts of the country?\n\nWe do have some presence in the North. We have partners in Kebbi, Zaria and Abuja. Also, A few months ago, Aimcare\u2019s non-profit vehicle; Waterease Organisation, provided clean water to the good people of Dasham Community in Bauchi State by building them a borehole. That project will provide water to 700 people in and around that community. However, our biggest business comes from Lagos. Most of our commercial partners are in Lagos.\n\nWhat is your future projection for Aimcare?\n\nAs far as future projections go, our midterm goal is to disrupt the industry by helping primary healthcare facilities avoid stock outs and have uninterrupted access to inventory. We want to be able to improve access to medicines and medical products by providing innovative financing and inventory management solutions to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.\n\nOur long term goal is to be able to facilitate healthcare investment to the continent by financing infrastructure.\n\nYou are gradually bridging the gap in the healthcare sector, using Aimcare in providing opportunities, what have been the challenges you have encountered so far?\n\nThe challenges we are facing are perhaps not significantly different from the challenges many businesses in Nigeria are facing. For instance, our business is very reliant on FX and a few months ago we were doing business at N400 to $1. Currently we are doing business at N510 to $1. This makes things very difficult especially for companies like us aiming to ensure the prices of our products are super affordable.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and what events shaped you into the person you are today?\n\nGrowing was fun. We did not have a lot, but my parents ensured I got the best education I could possibly have gotten. I attended private schools at both nursery and primary and secondary school levels. I remember that my secondary school was quite pricey at the time, and it makes me wonder how my parents were able to afford, as I look back in retrospect.\n\nI generally had a slow start in life; I could not read a timepiece until I was about 10, 11 years old. But as an only child, my mother\u2019s support was relentless. She used to call me Doctor and always wanted me to be a Doctor. I hope as she looks down from heaven, she is proud that I am on my way to getting a Doctorate and I\u2019ll truly be called a Doctor even though it is not medical. But even importantly, I hope she is even more proud that I am running a successful healthcare start-up that is tackling some of the things that cost her life.",

          "text": "- Advertisement -\n\nDr Isaiah Okere, a meat scientist at the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (IAR&T), Ibadan, has warned against the use of chemicals for the preservation of meats and food items.\n\nOkere gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Ibadan.\n\nHe said that chemicals such as formaldehyde or its derivative Formalin, used to preserve human corpses were sometimes used by some people to preserve meat and fish.\n\nAccording to him, such chemical substances are known to be carcinogenic (can lead to cancer) affecting vital organs like the kidney, liver, and lungs.\n\nHe said that meat or fish preserved with Formaldehyde/Formalin could be easily identified as they were always stiff and odourless.\n\n\u201cTo know fresh meats, one should examine the colour; red meat should be bright red, if it turns a bit purple, it\u2019s still ok, but means it has been exposed to some oxygen.\n\n\u201cEnsure to press the meat firmly with your finger, if it springs back nicely, it is fresh, if not, it is most likely old because it is losing its firmness.\n\n\u201cMeat should never smell like bleach, ammonia or anything foul,\u201d he said.\n\nOn meat preservation, Okere recommended refrigeration, stressing that typically refrigerated storage life for fresh meats is five to seven days.\n\nHe, however, said that with the erratic electricity supply situation, it was advisable to limit refrigerated storage to between two to three days.\n\n\u201cFreezing is a better option in the face of erratic supply of electricity and storage life can last longer (running into months) than that of the typical refrigerated storage.\n\n\u201cMeat can be vacuum-packaged (packaging free of oxygen), which extends the storage life under refrigerated conditions to approximately 100 days.\n\n\u201cSince vacuum packaging is free of oxygen, it minimises the oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acids and slows the development of rancid meat.\n\n\u201cAlso, drying is another method of meat preservation, it removes moisture from meat products so that microorganisms cannot grow.\n\n\u201cDry sausages and frozen-dried meat are examples of dried meats capable of being stored at room temperature without rapid spoilage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that smoking of meat as well as currying with mixture containing salt and other natural preservatives decreases the available moisture in the surface of meat products, preventing microbial growth and spoilage.\n\nThe meat scientist underscored the need to protect oneself by observing these precautions, adding that a good risk reduction measure, was to wash all food (meat) thoroughly under running water to wash off the contaminant.\n\n\u201cMeat should be cooked thoroughly before consumption because temperatures of 75\u00b0C or above aid removal of formaldehyde.\n\n\u201cIt is advisable to purchase meat and fish products when they are fresh and have the meaty or fishy smell characteristics,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Dr Mutiu Oladele-Bukola, a Veterinary Doctor at IAR&T, said that a slice of good meat would have a clear marble-like pattern and should feel slightly hard when cold.\n\n\u201cThe colour of fresh meat should be bright red, the redder the meat, the fresher it is.\n\n\u201cIf the meat is turning reddish-brown, that means it has been exposed to air for at least half an hour,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, consumers determine quality meat as one with desirable colour, firm texture, less drip, high marbling, and moderate visible fat with fresh meat smell.\n\n\u201cDiscoloration, soft texture, large amount of drip, less marbling, excessive visible fat and abnormal meat odor, are considered as poor quality traits for fresh meat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Therefore, highly recommended that consumers should watch out, buy and eat fresh meat for a healthier life,\u201d he said.\n\n(NAN)",

To God be the glory.\u201d\n\nThere was also reports of attack on the offices of the Directorate of State Services (DSS) and Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) which were set ablaze by suspected gunmen.\n\nResidents confirmed that DSS facility in the industrial city was attacked by the gunmen who reportedly drove from Owerri Road in four Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), stopped at Emecourt Road Junction where they released gunshots which made passersby to scamper for safety.\n\nThey later drove through Nkwo Triangle Roundabout and moved towards Nnobi Road.A passersby who was reportedly hit by a stray bullet was rushed to a nearby hospital.\n\nMilitary armoured vehicle, according to the witnesses later surfaced and drove round town passing through Emecourt Road. But there was no exchange of fire as the military and the gunmen did not meet as at the time of filing this report.\n\nHowever, spokesman of the state Police Command, Toochukwu Ikenga, said it was only one location in Nnewi, that was attacked, contrary to reports on social media and in some blogs.\n\nHe told Daily Sun that the attack in a location in Nnewi was a case of arson. He, however, declined to mention the name of the place attacked and the mastermind.\n\n\u201cThe details I have before me now is a case of arson in Nnewi, at about 2pm today.

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nAdamawa, Kaduna and Plateau states are set join the ongoing legal battle over the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) between the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Rivers and Lagos states.\n\nThis is coming as the Federal Government through the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) is working on some legal papers that would make it transmute from a mere respondent to the appeal filed by the FIRS to an appellant in the litigation.\n\nThe Lagos State Government was on Thursday last week joined as a respondent in the legal battle against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) by the Abuja division of the Court of Appeal.\n\nRuling on the motion for joinder filed before it, the Court of Appeal held that Lagos has established beyond doubt that it had substantial and sufficient legal right and interest to protect in the revenue collection dispute.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling, the court ordered that all processes filed in respect of the suit be served on Lagos as a third respondent to enable the state respond as required by law to the appeal filed by FIRS.\n\nBut while Rivers and Lagos states are challenging the powers of the FIRS to collect VAT, the three northern states are entering the battle field to pitch tent with the FIRS and the Federal Government.\n\nThe FIRS is contesting the judgment of the Port Harcourt division of the Federal High Court, stopping it from collecting VAT and Personal Income Tax (PIT) in Rivers State.\n\nJustice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, had in his judgment, held that it was the Rives Government that should collect VAT and PIT henceforth in the state.\n\nThe court also issued an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Attorney General of the federation, both first and second defendants in the suit, from collecting, demanding, threatening and intimidating residents of Rivers State to pay to FIRS personnel income tax and Value Added Tax.\n\nHowever, dependable sources closed to the AGF and governors of the three states, yesterday, in Abuja confided in our correspondent that they would file a leave of the court to be joined in the suit on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough the AGF is already a defendant in the appeal, the source said the Federal Ministry of Justice under the AGF has opted to be part of the appellant in the matter so as to enable it argue effectively in support of the FIRS.\n\n\u201cThey are going to seek to be joined in the suit as co-appellants against the federal high court\u2019s judgment that favours Rivers State.\n\n\u201cThese states understand the possible consequences if the final judgment at the Supreme Court goes against the FIRS.They are going to take the fight as if it is theirs,\u201d the source stated.\n\n\u201cIn fact, their motion papers would be ready by October 4 and will be filed on Tuesday October 5. I can confirm that one to you, the source revealed.\n\nThe source also added that more states especially Kogi and Zamfara were going to be joining the suit to form a coalition with the FIRS.\n\nHowever, Dr. Jibrilla Umar Gwandu, senior special assistant to the AGF, Abubakar Malami, could not be reached for comment at the time of filing this report.\n\nThe decision of the three states is coming on the heels of the communique released by the Northern State Governors\u2019 Forum last week where they expressed dissent and disagreement with the VAT laws of Lagos and Rivers State.\n\n\u201cVAT is being confused by Lagos and Rivers state governments as a sales tax. If every state government enacted its own VAT law, multiple taxation would result in increase in prices of goods and services and collapse in inter-state trade,\u201d\n\nPlateau State Governor, Simon Lalong read the communique of the meeting of the governors and northern traditional rulers.\n\nTax experts have also argued that were states to collect their VAT, there is likely going to be a chaotic VAT regime of possible instances of double taxation, over-taxing, poor efficiency of collection, deterioration of the ease of doing business gains, among others.\n\nIn a paper titled \u201cHow To Fix Nigeria\u2019s Broken VAT System\u201d, Taiwo Oyedele, leading tax expert in West Africa, and the Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PwC, wrote: \u201cIf states enact their VAT or Sales tax laws, the guaranteed winners will be the federal government in respect of import VAT and international transactions (whether retained by FG only or paid into the Federation account and shared), and the FCT.\n\n\u201cStates that may either lose or gain are Lagos and Rivers due to Headquarters effect and subject to collection efficiency.\n\n\u201cLagos also has to deal with granting input VAT at 7.5% on items sourced by businesses outside the state against the lower output VAT rate of 6%. All other states and 774 local governments will be worse-off, all things being equal.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

It behoves of all Nigerians to say, \u2018we must work together to salvage our country and we must work together to move this country forward.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from. Because poverty does not know Fulani, does not know Hausa, the Igbo, it does not know Yoruba, it does not know other ethnic groups.\u201d\n\nWike said Rivers State would continue to be a place where every Nigerian can reside and consider as home. He, however, said it was also obligatory on all residents in the state to conduct their affairs within the confines of the law and be orderly.\n\nThe governor said it was the place of government to provide development for its people and ensure safety of all residents.\n\nHe also noted it is wrong for some residents to view government\u2019s development policy and efforts to provide security from the prism of religion or ethnicity.\n\n\u201cRivers State, for me, is a place for all Nigerians. Wherever you come from, whether you\u2019re from the East, North, West, or you\u2019re from the South. Whatever your religion, it is immaterial to me. All of us are Nigerians and we do things in common. The only thing I have always crave for is law and order and for people to understand that no society can progress without behaving orderly and without obeying the law.Wike enjoined the former Emir to advice his followers in the state to obey the law and live orderly.\u201d\n\nSanusi said he was on familiarisation tour to leaders and members of Tjjaniyya Order who are resident in Rivers State because he is their Grand Khaleefa.\n\nHe noted with delight the quality of leadership demonstrated by Governor Wike in making Rivers home for all Nigerians.\n\nHe also acknowledged the quality of public infrastructure, the development strides and security provided for all residents by the Wike\u2019s administration.\n\nHe assured the governor that the order does not tolerate extremism, but advocates peace, brotherhood, togetherness, solidarity and progress of the country.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Unapologetic Frontrunners Emerge for PDP\u2019s Ticket",
          "text": "Chuks Okocha\n\nLast week\u2019s zoning of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) national chairman to the north, which brightened chances that the presidential ticket of the party could go to the south, has thrown up five possible presidential frontrunners. And they are unapologetic to any vested interest or godfather.\n\nThe five PDP presidential hopefuls are the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike; former Senate President and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ayim Pius Ayim; Oyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde; Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel and his Delta State counterpart, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nThese candidates have no blemish, nor have they been charged for corruption, which some analysts believe is a good thing that will give the PDP a clean start from all the corruption allegations its previous leaders faced in the hands of the All Progressives Congress when it took over from the PDP in 2015.\n\nShould the parties zone the tickets to the south as the mood of the nation suggests, a likely scenario is that the two major parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP \u2013 would have candidates like these to compete for the tickets in their respective parties.\n\nWith the presidency most likely coming south at least following PDP\u2019s decision last week to zone Chairmanship to the north, these frontrunners have begun to see themselves as potential candidates for the PDP ticket.\n\nFor instance, a match-up from the two parties could throw up Nyesom Wike of the PDP versus Kayode Fayemi of the APC or Nyesom Wike versus Yemi Osinbajo of the APC or any of the other potential candidates.\n\nUnfortunately however, a former Vice President and PDP presidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, might have been blocked in the party going by feelers from the PDP race and will be most likely unable to form another party, with what is currently on the card.\n\nRelatedly, the APC might also field a southern candidate and whoever wins it, the seat goes south.\n\nAccording to a top figure in the PDP who does not want his name in print, \u201cThe point, is that PDP wants to choose one of its own from the south as a candidate. The north has indicated that it is not against power shift to south. So there is growing realisation that power will have to come to south.\n\nSince the zoning of the PDP chairmanship to north, there have been talks among PDP leaders for a southern candidate and many of them believed they didn\u2019t necessarily need a northern candidate to win the presidency.\n\nEven though that narrative was being pushed by Chief Raymond Dokpesi, and other interested parties, who had their eyes set on the big prize \u2013 the presidency and had increasingly seen themselves as candidates from the north.\n\nBut the eventual zoning of the chairmanship to the north, has technically changed the equation, and illuminated the chances of these five southerners from the PDP.\n\nNyesom Wike\n\nThe Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has since assuming office in 2015, established himself as a force to reckon with. Not only is he considered a major financier of the party, he has been dubbed as Mr. Project, owing to his record of performance as governor of the oil rich state.\n\nA major factor in the battle to have a southern president, Wike did everything humanly possible to push out his own man, Uche Secondus, who was PDP\u2019s national chairman until a Rivers court sacked him and paved the way for the current calculations in the party. Wike has proven himself worthy of the job, both in terms of politics and governance.\n\nUdom Emmanuel\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, has shown capacity since he took over from his predecessor and Minister for Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio. This even became evident after he \u2018parted ways\u2019 with Akpabio, who joined the ruling party, allegedly in search for \u2018security and staying power\u2019 in the run-up to the 2019 elections.\n\nWith a stellar record of performance and a good hold on the politics of his state, Emmanuel, a banker-turned politician, boasts the kind of scorecard required for the nation\u2019s top job. He is currently serving out his second term of eight years.\n\nAyim Pius Anyim\n\nOne of the most experienced horses from the southern hemisphere is Anyim Pius Anyim, a former Senate President and erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation. He stands a good chance, from different vantage positions, including his network of friends across the country.\n\nHaving held key positions in both the executive and legislative arms of government, Anyim, a South-easterner, comes to the table with loads of experience, age, maturity and the temperament for the job. Besides, he was a major arrowhead for the Southern presidency and indeed, headed the group that insisted the chairmanship must be zoned to the north.\n\nIfeanyi Okowa\n\nA former senator, the Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has been under intense pressure to run for the presidency, even before the PDP eventually brightened the chances of southerners by pushing its chairmanship up north.\n\nAlthough he has been discreet and quiet about such pressure, he also comes to the table with combined experiences of both the legislature and the executive. Quiet and self-effacing, Okowa commands the mien and maturity to lead a nation in search of identity and unity of purpose. What more? His leadership in Delta also speaks for him.\n\nSeyi Makinde\n\nThe only PDP governor from the South-west, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has acquitted himself well in the politics of the party, thus clinching a place others have considered immutable in the scheme of things.\n\nHe was prominent in all of the scheming that culminated in the eventual zoning of the party\u2019s chairmanship, switching as regularly as possible to suit what best answered the yearning of the south.\n\nCuriously, Makinde is the only first time governor amongst those in this category of PDP frontrunner for the presidency. He has, however, invested enough in the machinations and extrapolations that have shored up the chances of the south and therefore, found him a spot in the 2023 equation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Claims oil multinational breached a fundamental term agreement for assignment\n\nAlex Enumah and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company Limited has instituted a legal action against Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, seeking the sum of over $2.5 billion compensation over the sales of Oil Mining Licence 29.\n\nAiteo in the court action dated July 27, 2021 as accusing Shell of selling two Marginal Fields \u2013 Kugbo West and Okiori to it when it, \u201cknew or ought to have known that the defendant had handed over the wells to the federal government of Nigeria\\Nigerian national petroleum corporation for which the defendant received valuable consideration in or about 2009 prior to the agreement for assignment.\n\nThe plaintiff in the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/C8/738/2021, and filed by its lawyer, Kemi Pinheiro, SAN, is claiming that the defendant breached a fundamental term of the agreement for assignment dated October 17, 2014 as set out in schedule 1 part 3 \u2013 wells, in relation to the Kugbo West and Okiori oil well s listed in schedule 1 of the agreement for assignment.\n\nShell was the legal and beneficial holder of a 30 per cent undivided participating interest in OML 29, which is part of the undivided percentage interest held by the defendant in conjunction with TEPING, NAOC, NNPC amongst others.\n\nPrior to the assignment of the lease to Aiteo, Shell as the operator of OML 29 published Information Memorandum in October 2013 wherein it invited bids from interested entities for the acquisition of their joint undivided 45 percent participating interest in OML 29.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed it did not only join others to bid for OML 29 but emerged successful.\n\n\u201cAs consideration for the agreement, the plaintiff made the following respective payments of; $220,000,000.00 as deposit pending the negotiation, completion and execution of the transaction documents and relevant agreements and the balance of 2,130,000,000.00 upon the execution of the transaction and acquisition documents and the agreement,\u201d it stated.\n\nPlaintiff further averred that based on the agreement for assignment dated October 17, 2014, the defendant in conjunction with TEPING and NOAC as Assignors transferred to it their entire participating interest in OML 29 together with the rights, interest, obligations thereto and in the process purportedly also transferred their participating interest in the wells, \u201cwhen they knew or ought to have known that they had surrendered and given the wells to the NNPC/ the federal government about five years earlier for valuable consideration\u201d.\n\nWhile Aiteo claimed its bid for the acquisition of OML 29 was based upon a complete reliance on the representations in the electronic data room information, IM and the Agreement, particularly as they concern the wells contained within OML 29, it noted that issues came up in 2020 when it wanted to commence work on the assigned wells.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff found that the wells had been earlier, re-conveyed by the defendant to the NNPC on or about 2009,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the plaintiff the said re-conveyance of the wells were done (ostensibly by way of offsetting the defendant\u2019s incurred liabilities to the NNPC under the JOA operated by the defendant, adding that the wells were then offered to prospective buyers during the just concluded 2020 bid round conducted by the Department of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances therefore, the plaintiff avers that the representations made by the defendant as aforesaid were made falsely, deceitfully and fraudulently with the intention of depriving the plaintiff the full benefit of the assets and the undivided 45 percent participating interest in the wells,\u201d it claimed.\n\nPlaintiff further claimed that as a result of the deceit, its expectations as it relates to the wells can no longer be achieved and that its financial position has been severely and adversely impacted upon.\n\nPlaintiff averred that its inability to fully repay its alleged indebtedness to its financiers was directly attributed to the wrongful actions of Shell. While claiming that it paid the sum of $46.2 million for the wells, plaintiff argued if the money had been invested in other business ventures at the rate of 9.9 per cent interest rate per annum from 2014 till the commencement of the suit it would have yielded an additional sum of $52 million.\n\nPlaintiff therefore claimed that it is entitled to a refund of $99 million.\n\nIt also argued that although by clause 25 of the agreement, disputes emanating from the said agreement ought to be resolved through arbitration but since the fraudulent misrepresentation of the defendant goes to the root of the agreement to the sales of the wells it can not be entertained or determined by an arbitration tribunal.\n\nAiteo is therefore praying the Federal High Court to order Shell to refund him the sum of $46.2 million as payment attributable to Kugbo West and Okiori oil wells being money had and received for a consideration which has totally failed.\n\nPlaintiff is also asking for another sum of $52 million being the interest that ought to have accrued on the sum paid on the two wells.\n\nWhile it is claiming the sum of $500,000 general damages, it is also seeking the payment of $2.1 billion as the amount it would have derived from the sales of 32,000,000 barrels of crude oil and other petroleum products from the Kugbo West and 41,000,000 barrels of crude oil and other petroleum products from Okiori wells.\n\nIn 2015, shell reported that it had completed the assignment of its interest in oil OML 29 and the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (OML29 and NCTL) to Aiteo in total cash proceeds of some $1.7 billion.\n\nIt stated that the divestment was part of the strategic review of SPDC\u2019s onshore portfolio and in line with the federal government\u2019s aim of developing Nigerian companies in the country\u2019s upstream oil and gas business.\n\nOML29 covers an area of 983 square kilometres and includes the Nembe, Santa Barbara and Okoroba fields and related facilities and has a capacity of 600 thousand barrels per day.\n\nIn February this year, a Federal Court in Lagos, had issued an injunction barring Shell subsidiaries from withdrawing money in 20 local banks until it \u2018ringfences\u2019 potential damages in a lawsuit brought against the oil major by Aiteo.\n\nIn the case, the company was seeking about $4 billion in total over alleged problems over claims Shell undercounted its oil exports through deliberate improper metering of the Nigerian company\u2019s oil exports from the Bonny Light terminal.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Meanwhile, on the cashless matter, the court presided over by Justice Nnamdi Dimgba made the pronouncement in a judgment delivered in a suit filed against the CBN over alleged imposition of discriminatory bank charges on some categories of cash depositors.\n\nDepositors affected by the said discriminatory policy were those lodging N500,000 above in bank accounts domiciled in selected six states and the FCT.\n\nA legal practitioner, Chijioke Ifediora, who was a victim of the CBN discriminatory policy decided to challenge its legality and filed Suit FHC/AWK/CS/91/2020, arguing that the discriminatory bank charges was ultra vires, illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nThe CBN had in line with its cashless policy initiatives, imposed the contentious charges via two separate Circulars, BPS/DIR/GEN/CIR/04/004 and PSM/DIR/CON/CWO/02/014 dated 20th April 2017 and 17th September 2019 respectively.\n\nBut the plaintiff had urged the court to consider the provisions of Sections 1 (3 ) , 2 ( 1) and Section 42 of the constitution of Nigeria, 1999 ( as amended), in order to determine whether the said two CBN circulars were not discriminatory, ultra vires, unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nHe had stated that he took the decision to drag the CBN to court when on January 7th, 2020, he went to a bank at Amawbia Awka, Anambra State, to make cash lodgment of N600,000 into his account. According to him, a bank official told him that he would not be allowed to effect the deposit without paying the charge in accordance with the CBN circular PSM/DIR/CON/CWO/02/014.\n\nHe, therefore, asked the court to grant him three reliefs, namely, that the said two CBN circulars were ultra vires, unconstitutional and illegal and were in conflict with Section 1(3), Section 2(1) and Section 42 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nThe third relief sought by the plaintiff is that the charges emanating from the implementation of the two CBN Circulars are illegal and unlawful.\n\nConsequently, the plaintiff urged the court to make five Declaratory Orders compelling the CBN to refund illegal or unlawful charges imposed on all citizens and corporate bodies operating in Anambra, who were victims of the implementation of the said circulars. Others included the refund of all citizens and corporate bodies operating in Anambra, Abia, Lagos, Ogun, Kano, Rivers and FCT who were also allegedly made to pay the illegal or unlawful charges by the implementation of the CBN circulars; order a perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant (CBN) from publishing or issuing circulars or implementing similar policies that are discriminatory or in conflict with Section 42 of the constitution, restraining all financial institutions and deposit money banks from implementing similar discriminatory policies and lastly, direct the CBN to make a reversal publication of the implementation of the said circulars in five national newspapers indicating compliance with the Decision of Court and refund of the unlawful charges.\n\nIn his submission, counsel for the CBN, Chief Musa M. Tolani, an Aba-based legal practitioner, argued that the plaintiff lacked the locus standi to file the Suit, describing him as a meddlesome interloper, since he did not have the authority of all the citizens and corporate institutions residing in the affected states.\n\nHe also stated that the plaintiff failed to show how the policy affected him injuriously more than the rest of the residents of the states being sought to be protected.\n\nTolani added that the policy was introduced to facilitate the implementation of the CBN well intentioned and worthy cashless policy for the overall well-being of the federation economy.\n\nHowever, delivering his judgment, Justice Dimgba was inclined to agree with the plaintiff that the CBN policy was discriminatory ab initio before its eventual general application across the federation, hence the suit was challenging the lawfulness of the action of the CBN, which is a federal government agency\n\nThough he agreed with the plaintiff on the first three reliefs sought and affirmed that the CBN policy was discriminatory and offended section 42 of the 1999 constitution (as amended) the judge declined to grant the five consequential Orders.\n\nJustice Nnamdi explained that the refusal to grant the five consequential orders were no longer necessary since it was admitted during oral evidence that the CBN policy is now implemented nationwide.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says armed forces proud of role in Nigerian project at 61\n\n*Optimistic of victory over insecurity\n\n*Troops foil ISWAP attack on surrendered terrorists, families\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nChief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, at the weekend, said at no other time in Nigeria\u2019s history had members of the armed forces been so engaged in addressing the myriad of security challenges confronting the country and threatening the very foundation of her unity, security and wellbeing.\n\nHe however said that these notwithstanding, the armed forces remained proud of its critical role in project Nigeria as the nation marked her 61st independence anniversary celebration.\n\nSpeaking at a dinner organised by the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) for members of the Armed Forces in commemoration of Nigeria\u2019s 61st independence day anniversary celebration held in Abuja, Irabor said security forces were undaunted in spite of the challenges of insecurity and assured the citizens that the nation would be victorious.\n\nThis is coming as troops of Operation Hadin Kai, weekend, foiled an attack by fighters of the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), who attempted to free surrendered terrorists and their families in the North-east.\n\nEight thousand insurgents and their families have so far surrendered to troops.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Army said it would today launch Exercises Golden Dawn, Enduring Peace and Still Water nationwide.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff, Lt.Gen. Faruk Yahaya, is expected to flag-off all exercises at the venue of Exercise Golden Dawn, billed to take place at Oye-Emene, Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State.\n\nAt the dinner, where 24 officers and men of the armed forces were honoured for their gallantry in the war against insurgency, Irabor reiterated that the armed forces remained proud of its role in nation building.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate another anniversary of self rule, the Armed Forces of Nigeria is proud of its critical role and efforts in the Nigerian project. At no other time in Nigeria\u2019s history have members of the armed forces been so engaged in addressing the myriad of security challenges confronting the country that threatened the very foundation of our unity, security and well being.\n\n\u201cRising up to this challenge, the armed forces have made tremendous sacrifices. The Armed Forces of Nigeria remains resolute and undaunted in the face of these challenges and we shall be victorious\u201d, he assured,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther, the Armed Forces posthumously honoured the late Colonel Abu Ali, who paid the supreme price in 2016 while combating insurgents and terrorists in the the North-east.\n\nAlso honoured posthumously was the late Squadron Leader, Victor Uba, who paid the supreme price in the fight against banditry in the North-west.\n\nThe late officers alongside 20 other military personnel were recognised and honoured at the event held at Command Officers Mess, Asokoro, Abuja.\n\nMinister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd), who was special guest of honour at the event, commended the leadership of the armed forces for observing the sacred military tradition, which sought to improve regimentation as well as fostering comradeship among senior and junior office.\n\nHe noted that regimental dinner was a platform for officers to interact and share ideas on how to solve critical challenges facing their commands and helping to fast-track the attainment of national security objectives of government.\n\nMagashi, while commending the role played by the armed forces in the preservation and security of the nation since independence, noted that the \u201cspectacular achievements of the security agencies in the fight against terrorism, insurgency, militancy and banditry amongst others are well recognised and appreciated.\u201d\n\nThe minister assured the leadership of the armed forces of a sustained support in the provision of adequate logistics and equipment to aid the military in restoring lasting peace in the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, a war update issued by the Nigerian Army Headquarters, said ISWAP, confronted with the obvious reality of defeat, had embarked on a desperate move to undermine the depletion of its fighting force, resorted to attacks on surrendered Boko Haram members and their families.\n\nIt said the insurgents embarked on a mission to \u201cannihilate or capture Boko Haram terrorists, who surrendered in Damboa\u201d, but that, \u201cThe gallant troops of 25 Task Force Brigade Operation Hadin Kai, whose superior firepower forced the terrorists to withdraw in disarray, ensured Damboa did not fall to their antics.\u201d\n\nThe statement claimed \u201cthe terrorists made futile attempt to access the facility housing the surrendered BHT members but retreated, when confronted with the superior firepower of own troops\u201d, adding that the ISWAP attack was designed to discourage more terrorists from surrendering.\n\n\u201cThis antic of terror within terror is being employed by ISWAP to discourage intending surrendering terrorists in their ranks. The latest strategy is not unconnected with the frustration of the group as top ranking commanders and members denounce violent agitation to embrace peace in recent times,\u201d the Army said.\n\nThe update signed by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, reassured the people of Damboa and environs and urged them to go about their normal businesses as vigilant troops would proactively continue to provide security of lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe general public are (sic) also enjoined to provide actionable and timely information on the activities of these criminal elements and their collaborators.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, while commending troops for their doggedness, charged them to take the fight to the terrorists\u2019 enclaves to deny them freedom of action. He also reassured them of requisite support as they record more operational gains in Operation Hadin Kai\u201d, it said.\n\nAlso, a separate statement claimed the Nigeria Army would today launch Exercises Golden Dawn, Enduring Peace and Still Water nationwide.\n\nYahaya is expected to flag-off all exercises at the venue of Exercise Golden Dawn which will take place at Oye-Emene, Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State.\n\n\u201cFor all intents and purposes, it should be noted that these Field Training Exercises (FTEs) are routines conducted yearly by the Nigerian Army (NA), designed to effectively check all forms of criminality and allow for free movement of persons during the Yuletide.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the FTEs will equally provide a platform to sharpen the skill so f participating troops on the conduct of Internal Security Operations. The exercises will run concurrently in 2, 6, 81 and 82 Divisions Areas of Responsibilities(AOR) in the South West, South South and South East regions respectively,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement explained that the exercise would also be conducted in Headquarters Command Army Records, 401 Special Forces Brigade and Guards Brigade Areas of Responsibilities (AOR) in the North Central States of Kogi, Benue and the Federal Capital territory respectively.\n\n\u201cExpectedly, troops will be taken through operational rigours to effectively respond to security challenges, ranging from kidnapping, banditry, thuggery, brigandage, armed robbery, cultism, communal crisis, violent secessionist agitations, farmers-herders clashes and insurgency, amongst other crimes.\n\n\u201cThis will be complimented by robust civil-military relations activities in identified communities in the envisaged AORs. This intervention calls for critical stakeholders to support the Nigerian Army and other security agencies to stem the tide of crimes and criminality across the areas, particularly as the Yuletide approaches,\u201d it said.\n\nThe army, therefore, enjoined the public not to panic at sighting the movement of troops and equipment.\n\n\u201cThey are also urged to please continue to support the NA and other security agencies with credible information on the activities of criminals in their vicinity. Nigerians are please encouraged to take ownership of the exercise for a seamless celebration during the yuletide,\u201d it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Shortly thereafter, he left the PDP to the ruling APC.\n\nHowever, his defection was greeted with wide condemnation considering how he had initially described the APC as \"a group of crooks\".\n\nAs things stand, Abbo is said to be fighting multiple battles with almost all senior stakeholders of the party at the state and national levels.\n\nDisclosing Abbo's current ordeal, a chieftain in the party and former national vice chairman, Mustapha Salisu, said Abbo was on his way out.\n\nHe said, \"This man (Abbo) is a disappointment to many Nigerian youths.\n\n\"He is not fit for a revered institution like the APC or the Nigerian Senate.\n\n\"The other time, he was calling Governor Fintiri all sorts of names, vulgarly saying the governor was a small man in a big office.\n\n\"For God's sake, between Fintiri and Abbo, who is a small man in a big office? Fintiri, a two-time member, Speaker, acting governor and now elected governor, yet the juvenile senator could insult him as such.\"\n\nMustapha further disclosed that since Abbo joined the APC, the party, particularly at the state level, has been plagued with a series of crises.\n\n\"The other time he was using uncouth language against the immediate past governor of the state, Senator Jibrilla Bindow.\n\n\"Our party would not condone this type of thuggery from him.\n\n\"Take it from me, the APC has no room for the type of Abbo.

Two figureheads \u2013 Antony Janse Van Vuuren and Lance Lawson \u2014 were appointed its first directors while ultimate control resided with Mr Obi,\u201d the paper reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn the same day the company was incorporated, the nominee directors met and issued 50,000 shares of Gabriella Investment in favour of Hill International Holding Corporation, a shell International Business Company operating under the laws of Belize, another tax haven. The director of the company is Mr Van Vuuren, also one of the directors of Gabriella Investment.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear what businesses Mr Obi transacted with the entities but in some communications, they were sometimes referred to as investment vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe former governor was said to have since rearranged his offshore businesses by first renaming Gabriella Investment.\n\nBeginning February 10, 2017, Premium Times reported that the company became known as PMGG Investments Limited in what is a combination of the first letters of the first names of Obi\u2019s nuclear family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cP for Peter (ex-governor), M for Margaret (the ex-governor\u2019s wife), G for Gabriella (the ex-governor\u2019s daughter) and G for Gregory (the ex-governor\u2019s son),\u201d the report further read.\n\n\u201cMr Obi has also now created a trust known as The Gabriella Settlement, an entity also registered in the BVI. According to Fidelity Investments, a trust is a fiduciary arrangement that allows a third party, or trustee, to hold assets on behalf of a beneficiary or beneficiaries. Experts believe that trusts are traditionally used for minimising taxes even though they can offer other estate plan benefits as well.\n\n\u201cBy the current structuring of Mr Obi\u2019s wealth and offshore businesses, The Gabriella Settlement, which appears to hold all or a majority of his assets, is the sole shareholder of PMGG Investments.\n\n\u201cIn turn, a New Zealander entity, Granite Trust Company Limited is the sole trustee of The Gabriella Settlement.

The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nAccording to the president, a committee constituted to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue that led to the suspension of its activities in Nigeria had successfully addressed a number of key issues, including \u201cnational security and cohesion; registration of physical presence and representation; fair taxation; dispute resolution; and local content.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe committee, which was set up in July, is led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who revealed in August that the ban would be lifted in \u201ca matter of days\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter will soon be lifted as we are getting close to reaching full agreement,\u201d the minister said. \u201cWe have agreed on some areas, hopefully in the next few days or weeks, we will conclude.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.

Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling.

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Blockchain payments platform, Bitmama raises $350k pre-seed to expand product offerings",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, October 4, 2021, Bitmama is announcing a pre-seed raise of $350,000 as it looks to expand its product offerings into other African countries, grow its operational presence, and increase its team\n\nThe round was led by San Francisco-based VC, Flori Ventures, with participation from Nigeria-based VCs, Emergence Capital and Fedha Capital, and a host of other Angels and VCs.\n\nThe Delaware and Neuss, Germany based startup, founded in 2019 by Ruth Iselema, has become one of the prominent crypto exchanges serving the Nigerian and Ghanian market.\n\nA few weeks ago, Iselema had a sit down with Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2, as she gave insights into her journey and some exciting titbits along the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, the startup has two primary offerings, the Bitmama exchange, which enables users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies \u2014 read Bitcoin, Ethereum, Celo and six other cryptos \u2014 on the platform; and Changera, a cross-border payment product which it says allows users to \u201csend and receive money internationally, buy airtime or data for family and friends, pay utility bills for your loved ones from anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Nigerians were reported to have traded more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrency on local crypto exchanges \u2014 a number that is expected to grow in 2021.\n\nOver the past year, Africa has been regarded as one of the fastest-growing markets for crypto adoption globally. According to Chainalysis\u2019 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency report, countries like Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana rank in the top 20 in the world for crypto adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, Source: Chainalysis\n\nA fact which Chainalysis attributes to the high transaction volume in peer-to-peer (P2P) trading.\n\nIn countries like Kenya and Nigeria, where governments have banned cryptocurrency trading via banks, this holds particularly true. In Nigeria, Bitmama, like other local exchanges, rode the P2P wave in a bid to stay afloat of the ban early this year.\n\nInterestingly, Iselema tells Techpoint Africa that the round was closed in May 2021, and the company has gone on a hiring spree, growing the team while looking to expand into other African countries.\n\nAnd according to Akin Asalu, COO, Bitmama, \u201cSo, it\u2019s basically product development expansion into sub-Saharan markets, enhancing the products we have, and doubling down on them. For now, we don\u2019t see ourselves adding to them.\u201d\n\nAsalu joined the Bitmama team in May 2020 with previous founder experience at adtech startup, TaxiTV. The company enabled advertisers to target their audience on the go with partnerships with transport companies like Uber, GIGM, and ABC Transport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Bitmama has recorded more than $6 million in transaction volume this year, with over 15,000 users across its two offerings, a number which Iselema says keeps growing every day despite very little marketing by them. And all of whom Asalu says are active users.\n\nIn defining what he means by active users, Asalu explains that every single month, they\u2019ve seen each user perform transactions on the platform, whether buying and selling crypto or sending money to family members.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s just covering all those verticals on the app itself and being able to say that okay at every single point in this month, we\u2019ve had each person do at least one transaction over the course of the month. So I\u2019ll pretty much beat my chest and say 100%,\u201d he concludes.\n\nAn interesting assertion, to say the least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitmama website\n\nBut apart from that is the issue of trust and building a suitable product for users. Asalu says the idea is to keep growing transaction volume while creating a product that fosters trust. Because in Iselema\u2019s words, \u201cPeople test, so you focus on making the platform work well.\u201d\n\nInitially, the idea was to bootstrap. Why? Iselema says she believed that as a Blockchain company, you might not need a lot of capital, but her outlook began to change.\n\n\u201cBut when we saw that we had to pay developers, pay a lot more bills, only your funds cannot sustain it, and maybe the profit is not coming in as fast as you want.\u201d\n\nEssentially, they needed to raise capital to accelerate growth and hire more technical talent to improve their product offerings.\n\nAlthough raising the money was not a walk in the park, it helped that quite a number of the inventors were people already in their circle, so it was easy to begin the conversation.\n\nSpeaking on the investment, Maria Alegre, General Partner and Co-founder of Flori Ventures, says,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve partnered with Bitmama to help them in their growth journey. We are particularly interested in projects that explore universal basic income, community commerce, community currencies, natural-capital-backed currencies, accessible DeFi primitives, earnings platforms, peer-to-peer marketplaces.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s next?\n\nIselema says they are not looking to add to their product offerings. For now, instead, the focus is on expanding current products and adding new features. Perhaps why a lot of hiring occurred in the Engineering and Marketing departments.\n\nThere will also be expansion into some Francophone countries, Kenya, and Europe. A decision informed by the exorbitant cost to send and receive money despite digital advancement in recent years.\n\nOver the next few months, Iselema says the company will be looking to support the Blockchain ecosystem and developers via hackathons and opening up its wallet API to allow developers to build new products on it. For now, that would be accessible for free.\n\nThis will enable developers to create wallets for users based on Bitmama\u2019s wallet system. With this, they can store crypto or stake \u2014 locking crypto in a wallet to receive rewards.\n\nThe startup is also looking to launch a new product, Changera for businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangera\u2019s website\n\nCurrently, Changera allows individuals to send and receive money across the US, Africa, and Europe for as low as 2%; buy airtime or data, whether international or local; buy crypto on the Bitmama app using the Changera wallet, among other things.\n\nRemittances contribute a lot to sub-Saharan GDP. in the last few years, Nigeria has seen more in remittance inflow than it gets from the sale of oil. But, it\u2019s pretty expensive to send and receive money.\n\nOn average, a transaction of $200 could cost 8.02% in transfer fees. Compared to South Asia, where the number is 4.64%, that\u2019s almost double the rate.\n\nBut with this new product, businesses can send and receive money using their wallet, pay bills, pay employee salaries, and hold multi-currency accounts.\n\nUsers can also get a subscription-based virtual card which has limits on the amount allowed on the card \u2014 $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000.\n\nWith over 20 team members scattered worldwide, although Iselema says she cannot confirm if Bitmama is profitable, she says we should ask again at the Series A stage. A question we look forward to asking.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, education has evolved from self-education through self-directed play and exploration, acquiring a vast knowledge of plants and herbs for agricultural purposes to teaching certain expectations and behaviours to children.\n\nIn recent years, education has changed into a tool for children to learn and apply their talents or skills and for young people and adults to understand the competitive nature of the workforce.\n\nSimilarly, with the advancement of technology, students are no longer restricted to the four walls of a classroom to learn a new course, acquire a skill, or advance in a specific field of interest.\n\nGlobally, technology is rapidly transforming education. While edtech in Africa is moving slower due to power shortage and low Internet penetration, some African edtech startups like Ulesson, M-Lugha, FoondaMate, and Tuteria are helping Africans learn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an article by Ivan Kubicova for WorldRemit, a fintech company, Tuteria, a company that connects students with qualified tutors in their neighbourhood, is one of the few edtech startups changing education in Africa.\n\nIn addition, research by Brandon D. Faroa, a Psychology lecturer at the University of the Western Cape, shows that tutoring may be one of the most critical strategies for facilitating student engagement to achieve academic success.\n\nPlus, tutoring helps increase a child\u2019s motivation and attitude to reach their full learning potential.\n\nAs a result, Godwin Benson, CEO, and Abiola Oyeniyi, CTO, launched Tuteria, an edtech company, in 2014 to make learning accessible to learners who want to reach their learning potential.\n\nRecognising an opportunity and seizing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Abiola Oyeniyi, Godwin Benson\n\nBenson was hired in 2005 to tutor a child who was struggling with maths. However, payment was delayed after teaching, which troubled him greatly.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t his first time tutoring, as he did it alongside his studies as a Systems Engineering student at the University of Lagos, Lagos State. He met Oyeniyi in the university, where both finished with first-class honours from the same department.\n\nThat experience got him thinking, how could a seamless method ensuring payment for tutorial services be created?\n\n\u201cAfter Abiola (Oyeniyi) and I graduated, I realised this was still a persistent problem. Also, I noticed that parents often found it difficult to get qualified tutors who could actually deliver on their promise,\u201d he explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenson recognised a valuable opportunity in the education industry to create an innovative platform that would benefit both students and teachers, and he decided to seize it.\n\nIt would be nine years until Tuteria was launched.\n\n\u201cAs of 2005, Tuteria was just an idea in my head. I didn\u2019t know how to implement it because Abiola and I didn\u2019t have the resources until 2014,\u201d he says.\n\nMaking learning accessible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Val\u00e9ria Rodrigues Val\u00e9ria from Pixabay\n\nTuteria believes that everyone is a learner and that people are always eager to learn one thing or the other based on their interests. The company makes learning accessible to everyone in Nigeria, regardless of their level of education.\n\nThe company has tutors in all 36 states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nTuteria explores learning beyond the classroom. It covers some subjects and courses taught in primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions, with tutors available for international exams such as the IELTS and GRE.\n\nAlso, the company covers skills and professions such as make-up, dance, photography, swimming, coding, music, and public speaking.\n\nTuteria makes learning more convenient for their learners. Essentially, lessons can be delivered at their preferred location, physical or online.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been very big on convenience for our learners; hence we make it easy for them to reach us and access our service. They can request for our services via phone call, WhatsApp, social media platforms, emails or just walking into our office in Lagos,\u201d Oyeniyi mentions.\n\nTuteria also ensures that tutors are assigned based on their proximity to the location of the learners.\n\n\u201cAll of our tutors go through rigorous verification and assessment processes, and only a small number of them are hired. They are about 20%,\u201d he reveals.\n\nThe company believes that background and security verifications and tutors\u2019 assessments are essential to ensure the learner\u2019s safety.\n\nChampioning convenience with Tuteria 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuteria homepage\n\nIn May 2021, Tuteria launched Tuteria 2.0, an upgraded version of its website, to continue to make \u201cthe learning process more seamless, effective and affordable.\u201d\n\nWith the upgraded version, parents or students can submit a request by describing what they are looking for in a tutor and providing information about their child or themselves.\n\nPre-assessment tests are also given to children in person after tutors have been assigned to determine problem areas.\n\nParents can give detailed descriptions of their child\u2019s learning needs. The algorithm will automatically generate tutors that have experience in that area.\n\nThey can filter tutors generated after placing a request based on their budget to get who works best for them. Each lesson features a progress report that parents can view and detailed follow-ups from their learning support staff regarding their child\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cWe also make certain that lessons are as convenient as possible for our students so that they can choose their own schedule and mode of instruction. With our platform\u2019s recent upgrades, they can also now optimise their request by budget and see tutors who fall within that range,\u201d Benson says.\n\nTuteria\u2019s pricing system is based on an hourly rate per student, with tutors free to set their rates for each subject. The upgraded platform helps users pay directly on the site and initiate contact with their selected tutor immediately.\n\n\u201cThere is no fixed fee. Every tutor on our platform determines their own fee. Furthermore, the number of days and hours spent learning determines the cost of learning. However, we take a 15% to 30% cut of the total cost, while the tutor earns between 70% to 85% of the fee, depending on their rating and experience,\u201d he clarifies.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the use of video courses and the convenience they bring as more Nigerians embrace digital learning,\u201d he adds.\n\nGrowth and expansion plans in a challenging economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuteria has over 3,000 tutors and has served over 50,000 learners since its inception. This includes academic and non-academic learners and qualified tutors in a wide range of subjects.\n\nThe majority of their funding comes from the revenue they generate. The startup has also raised money from a few private investors.\n\n\u201cWe receive over 500 tutor applications each month. However, we are unable to track the number of our learners because their requests vary across academic, exam preparation, skill acquisition, and other interests,\u201d Benson says.\n\n\u201cStill, we continue to record impressive growth every quarter, and we have several new and innovative products and services in the works we believe will contribute further to our growth, \u201dhe adds.\n\nHowever, the unstable economic situation of the country is a challenge for Tuteria.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that the average Nigerian\u2019s purchasing power has steadily declined over the years. When someone is unable to afford as much as they once could, they look to cut as many expenses as they can, even if it means foregoing critical needs such as good academic tutoring for their children,\u201d he points out.\n\nNonetheless, the company claims to have addressed the issue by introducing a budget optimisation feature on its upgraded platform. This allows parents or learners to filter the estimated cost based on their budget and only see tutors who fall within that range.\n\nIn addition, Oyeniyi attributes the company\u2019s success to Tuteria\u2019s incredible team.\n\n\u201cThe team has been incredible. It is difficult to find dedicated people to work in a startup because it requires consistency and diligence, but we have been fortunate in that regard.\u201d\n\nTuteria intends to expand into other African countries as it grows.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we are looking to expand to Ghana. There is no similar service in Ghana. Most especially, there\u2019s a lot of potential for us there. We really don\u2019t have a specific launch date for Ghana now. It is part of future projections but nothing specific now. \u201d\n\nThe co-founders believe that the Nigerian edtech industry is exciting because it is young and has a lot of potential for Tuteria to thrive.\n\n\u201cTypically, the tech ecosystem has been skewed toward fintech, but it\u2019s great to see more attention being paid to edtech, especially given how much it helps solve the African continent\u2019s education disparity,\u201d Benson mentions.\n\nLikewise, the co-founders are confident that the edtech community will continue to produce innovative products and services, and they are eager to explore them to make learning more accessible to all Nigerians and Africans at large.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe Nigeria Startup BIll\n\nNigeria-Twitter negotiations\n\nZamfara\u2019s telecommunications blackout, again\n\nLagos Angel Network\u2019s new Board of Governors\n\nDid you join our Ask Us Anything session?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow of hands, who joined our Ask Us Anything session on Thursday, September 30, 2021?\n\nAll right, you can put your figurative hands down now. We had a lovely time answering your questions, and as part of the moderator duo, I can tell you that it was fun asking those questions. Never before heard stories, and some unplanned Google endorsements happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill we have more? Let\u2019s say there are several things in the pipeline, and you should be expecting a lot.\n\nP.S. If you didn\u2019t attend, I have this cliche phrase ready, \u201cYou missed!\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in a startup act?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nWhat do we know about startup acts? They are laws meant to create an enabling environment for high growth technology-enabled businesses \u2014 read startups. They aim to create a framework that helps solve problems around funding, infrastructure, and uncertain policies.\n\nSome backstory: To a large extent, startup acts evolved from small business acts, which were enacted to support Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Know what I find interesting? Only three countries \u2014 Italy, Argentina, and the Philippines \u2014 outside Africa have startup acts.\n\nBut what\u2019s going on in Africa? On the continent, only Tunisia and Senegal have enacted startup acts. Tunisia\u2019s 2018 Startup Act provides several incentives like salaries for founders in the first year, an eight-year tax break, among others.\n\nCurrently, in Nigeria, plans to present a startup bill are underway. The project is the brainchild of several notable persons in the tech ecosystem and is in collaboration with the federal government.\n\nIn August, we told you that the website for the startup bill was live and that a final draft is expected to be submitted to Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari in October \u2014 this month.\n\nFor a country like Nigeria, which has seen several seemingly destructive policies \u2014 the okada and cryptocurrency bans \u2014 and eye-raising government actions, this bill seems like a godsend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny news? For now, no. But while we wait, our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel, did a deep dive into the intricacies of startup acts, what we might see in the final draft of Nigeria\u2019s Startup BIll, and if it can save a tired tech ecosystem.\n\nRead this for a surprise: Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nWhat happens when Twitter says yes to Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, October 1, 2021, was Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day, and as usual, citizens woke up to the customary speech by President Buhari.\n\nIn his speech, he informed Nigerians that the Twitter ban would only be lifted if the social media platform succumbed to the government\u2019s three demands \u2014 a local office, an over-the-top (OTT) services licence, and tax payment.\n\nThe ban, which has lasted for four months, began in June after Twitter deleted a Tweet by Buhari because it violated the platform\u2019s policies.\n\nSince then, the government has set up a committee to preside over negotiations. More recently, in August, Lai Mohammed, Minister for Information and Culture, told Nigerians that the ban would be lifted in a matter of days.\n\nIn an email to The Verge on Friday, a Twitter spokesperson said that discussions with the Nigerian government had been \u201crespectful and productive\u201d and that the company continues to \u201cengage with the Nigerian government and we are committed to charting a path forward to the restoration of Twitter for everyone in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut what should Nigerians expect if Twitter agrees to the government\u2019s demands? Well, our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, found some answers to this question and some others you might have.\n\nCheck them out here: #TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?\n\nAnother Zamfara telecommunications blackout update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems every Monday I keep bringing you some more news on the Zamfara blackout. This is the last one, I hope; but, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nOn Friday, October 1, 2021, Bello Matatwalle, Zamfara State\u2019s governor, ordered the restoration of telecommunications networks in Gusau, the state capital.\n\nZailani Baffa, the governor\u2019s spokesperson, announced this in a statement to reporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe restoration of the service at the state capital becomes imperative following the tremendous success recorded in the fight against banditry in the state and to ease the hardship faced by both the private and public sectors of the state,\u201d said Baffa.\n\nTremendous success? On Thursday, September 30, 2021, the Zamfara State government said it had arrested over 2000 bandits\u2019 informants since the blackout. This was said by Ibrahim Dosara, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Information, at a press conference in Kaduna State.\n\nDosara also claims the bandits have been neutralised, with most resorting to eating raw food and millet and using camels to perpetrate violence.\n\n2000 bandits\u2019 informants? With Nigeria\u2019s famed history for unlawful arrests \u2014 look no farther than the #EndSars protests \u2014 I am a bit suspicious of that number. But quite apart from that, I am not entirely convinced of the effectiveness of the blackout.\n\nWhat happens when there\u2019s an emergency? How do you contact the police when there\u2019s been an attack? Will we see more blackouts like this in other states?\n\nAre you pondering what I\u2019m pondering? If you are, then you should be expecting a story in due course. Till then, do you have any thoughts on my questions? Please let me know in the comments.\n\nLagos Angel Network\u2019s new Board of Governors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos Angel Network\u2019s new Board of Governors.

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Femi Falana, has berated the political elites for the dwindling state of the nation after years of independence.\n\nMr Falana, in an interview on Sunday Politics, a programme of Channels Television, blamed the country\u2019s retrogressive situations on the reluctance of its leaders to design its structures.\n\nNigeria marked its 61st Independence anniversary on October 1.\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s 61 years journey has been \u201cso far, so bad\u201d, given the fact that countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia who were on the same pedestal as the country in the 1960s have \u201cfrog jumped\u201d their third world status to world leading economies.\n\n\u201cSo, for the majority of our people, 1960 provided an opportunity to start all over again but, unfortunately, the nationalist politicians, who took over the reins of power from the British colonial regime, did not decolonise the country and the psyche of our people, and all of them retained the colonial structures.\n\n\u201cThe laws and ordinances were simply changed to the Act of Parliament. The institutions were left intact,\u201d Mr Falana, who spoke after a Bauchi Senator, Adamu Bulkachuwa, said.\n\nHe said the country started missing its opportunity for a better status the moment its political elites started embracing colonial pathways rather than creating its own.\n\nMr Falana also criticised President Muhammadu Buhari Independence Day broadcast, where he thanked the British for uniting Nigeria, despite the notoriety of the colonial regime for divide and rule approach, a feature that has continued to describe the country\u2019s political landscape.\n\nOn the debate for the zoning of the 2023 Presidential ticket by southern and northern political leaders, the lawyer noted that such tussle is divisive and should not be condoned in the political space.\n\nHe argued that such debate will further reduce the country\u2019s political development to regional affairs rather than promoting better governance for all.\n\n\u201cFinally, on the presidency, I am very reluctant to join issues with those who want the presidency in the south or north, and I am going to appeal to the media to assist Nigerians to challenge those who are reducing the politics of 2023 to regional affairs.\n\n\u201cWe must ask those who want the president and their candidate to address the problems of underdevelopment of our country, what will be your position on VAT? What will be your position on access to education for Nigerian children? What will be your position on going abroad for medical treatment? Unless you ask these questions, you must ask these questions, otherwise, it becomes a question of \u2018it is my turn,\u201d Mr Falana said.",

          "title": "Pandora papers: biggest leak of offshore data reveals financial secrets of rich, powerful",
          "text": "Biggest trove of secret deals and hidden assets of some of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people, including some Nigerians, have been revealed in a investigative piece known as Pandora papers.\n\nThe cache includes 11.9m files from companies hired by wealthy clients to create offshore structures and trusts in tax havens such as Panama, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland and the Cayman Islands, according to Guardian UK report.\n\nThey expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers and heads of state. They also shine a light on the secret finances of more than 300 other public officials such as government ministers, judges, mayors and military generals in more than 90 countries.\n\nThe files include disclosures about major donors to the Conservative party, raising difficult questions for Boris Johnson as his party meets for its annual conference.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars and business leaders. Many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts, as well as incognito bank accounts. There is even art ranging from looted Cambodian antiquities to paintings by Picasso and murals by Banksy.\n\nThe Pandora papers reveal the inner workings of what is a shadow financial world, providing a rare window into the hidden operations of a global offshore economy that enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and in some cases pay little or no tax.\n\nThere are emails, memos, incorporation records, share certificates, compliance reports and complex diagrams showing labyrinthine corporate structures. Often, they allow the true owners of opaque shell companies to be identified for the first time.\n\nThe files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington. It shared access to the leaked data with select media partners including the Guardian, BBC Panorama, Le Monde and the Washington Post. More than 600 journalists have sifted through the files as part of a massive global investigation.\n\nThe Pandora papers represent the latest \u2013 and largest in terms of data volume \u2013 in a series of major leaks of financial data that have convulsed the offshore world since 2013.\n\nSetting up or benefiting from offshore entities is not itself illegal, and in some cases people may have legitimate reasons, such as security, for doing so. But the secrecy offered by tax havens has at times proven attractive to tax evaders, fraudsters and money launderers, some of whom are exposed in the files.\n\nOther wealthy individuals and companies stash their assets offshore to avoid paying tax elsewhere, a legal activity estimated to cost governments billions in lost revenues.\n\nAfter more than 18 months analysing the data in the public interest, the Guardian and other media outlets will publish their findings over the coming days, beginning with revelations about the offshore financial affairs of some of the most powerful political leaders in the world.\n\nThey include the ruler of Jordan, King Abdullah II, who, leaked documents reveal, has amassed a secret $100m property empire spanning Malibu, Washington and London. The king declined to answer specific questions but said there would be nothing improper about him owning properties via offshore companies. Jordan appeared to have blocked the ICIJ website on Sunday, hours before the Pandora papers launched.\n\nThe Azerbaijan president, Ilham Aliyev, and his wife, Mehriban Aliyeva. The Aliyev family has traded close to \u00a3400m of UK property in recent years. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe files also show that Azerbaijan\u2019s ruling Aliyev family has traded close to \u00a3400m of UK property in recent years. One of their properties was sold to the Queen\u2019s crown estate, which is now looking into how it came to pay \u00a367m to a company that operated as a front for the family that runs a country routinely accused of corruption. The Aliyevs declined to comment.\n\nThe Pandora papers also threaten to cause political upsets for two European Union leaders. The prime minister of the Czech republic, Andrej Babi\u0161, who is up for election this week, is facing questions over why he used an offshore investment company to acquire a $22m chateau in the south of France. He too declined to comment.\n\nThe Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, is facing questions over why he used an offshore investment company to acquire a $22m chateau in the south of France. Photograph: Milan Kammermayer/EPA\n\nAnd in Cyprus, itself a controversial offshore centre, the president, Nicos Anastasiades, may be asked to explain why a law firm he founded was accused of hiding the assets of a controversial Russian billionaire behind fake company owners. The firm denies any wrongdoing, while the Cypriot president says he ceased having an active role in its affairs after becoming leader of the opposition in 1997.\n\nNot everyone named in the Pandora papers is accused of wrongdoing. The leaked files reveals that Tony and Cherie Blair saved \u00a3312,000 in property taxes when they purchased a London building partially owned by the family of a prominent Bahraini minister.\n\nThe former prime minister and his wife bought the \u00a36.5m office in Marylebone by acquiring a British Virgin Islands (BVI) offshore company. While the move was not illegal, and there is no evidence the Blairs proactively sought to avoid property taxes, the deal highlights a loophole that has enabled wealthy property owners not to pay a tax that is commonplace for ordinary Britons.\n\nThe leaked records vividly illustrate the central coordinating role London plays in the murky offshore world. The UK capital is home to wealth managers, law firms, company formation agents and accountants. All exist to serve their ultra-rich clients. Many are foreign-born tycoons who enjoy \u201cnon-domicile\u201d status, which means they pay no tax on their overseas assets.\n\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is also named in the leak. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nUkraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was elected in 2019 on a pledge to clean up his country\u2019s notoriously corrupt and oligarch-influenced economy, is also named in the leak. During the campaign, Zelenskiy transferred his 25% stake in an offshore company to a close friend who now works as the president\u2019s top adviser, the files suggest. Zelenskiy declined to comment and it is unclear if he remains a beneficiary.\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, whom the US suspects of having a secret fortune, does not appear in the files by name. But numerous close associates do, including his best friend from childhood \u2013 the late Petr Kolbin \u2013 whom critics have called a \u201cwallet\u201d for Putin\u2019s own wealth, and a woman the Russian leader was allegedly once romantically involved with. None responded to invitations to comment.\n\nThe Pandora papers also place a revealing spotlight on the offshore system itself. In a development likely to prove embarrassing for the US president, Joe Biden, who has pledged to lead efforts internationally to bring transparency to the global financial system, the US emerges from the leak as a leading tax haven. The files suggest the state of South Dakota, in particular, is sheltering billions of dollars in wealth linked to individuals previously accused of serious financial crimes.\n\nThe offshore trail also stretches from Africa to Latin America to Asia, and is likely to pose difficult questions for politicians across the world. In Pakistan, Moonis Elahi, a prominent minister in prime minister Imran Khan\u2019s government, contacted an offshore provider in Singapore about investing $33.7m.\n\nIn Kenya, the president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has portrayed himself as an enemy of corruption. In 2018, Kenyatta told the BBC: \u201cEvery public servant\u2019s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask: what is legitimate?\u201d\n\nHe will come under pressure to explain why he and his close relatives amassed more than $30m of offshore wealth, including property in London. Kenyatta did not respond to enquiries about whether his family wealth was declared to relevant authorities in Kenya.\n\nThe Pandora papers also reveal some of the unseen repercussions of previous offshore leaks, which spurred modest reforms in some parts of the world, such as the BVI, which now keeps a record of the real owners of companies registered there. However, the newly leaked data shows money shifting around offshore destinations, as wealthy clients and their advisers adjust to new realities.\n\nSome clients of Mossack Fonseca, the now defunct law firm at the heart of the 2016 Panama papers disclosures, simply transferred their companies to rival providers such as another global trust and corporate administrator with a major office in London, whose data is in the new trove of leaked files.\n\nAsked why he was migrating the new company, one customer wrote bluntly: \u201cBusiness decision to exit following the Panama papers.\u201d Another agent said the industry had always \u201cadapted\u201d to external pressure.\n\nSome leaked files appear to show some in the industry seeking to circumvent new privacy regulations. One Swiss lawyer refused to email the names of his high-value customers to a service provider in the BVI, following new legislation. Instead, he sent them by airmail, with strict instructions they should not be processed in any \u201celectronic way\u201d. The identity of another beneficial owner was shared via WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this way to proceed is to enable you to comply with BVI rules,\u201d the lawyer wrote. Referring to Mossack Fonseca, the lawyer added: \u201cYou are obliged to keep secrecy for our clients and to not make feasible at all a second \u2018Panama papers\u2019 story that happened to one of your competitors.\u201d\n\nGerard Ryle, the director of the ICIJ, said leading politicians who organised their finances in tax havens had a stake in the status quo, and were likely to be an obstacle to reform of the offshore economy. \u201cWhen you have world leaders, when you have politicians, when you have public officials, all using the secrecy and all using this world, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see an end to it.\u201d\n\nHe expected the Pandora papers to have a greater impact than previous leaks, not least because they were arriving in the middle of a pandemic that had exacerbated inequalities and forced governments to borrow unprecedented amounts to be shouldered by ordinary taxpayers. \u201cThis is the Panama papers on steroids,\u201d Ryle said. \u201cIt\u2019s broader, richer and has more detail.\u201d\n\nAt least $11.3tn in wealth is held offshore, according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \u201cThis is money that is being lost to treasuries around the world and money that could be used to recover from Covid,\u201d Ryle said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing out because some people are gaining. It\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s a very simple transaction that\u2019s going on here.\u201d\n\nPandora papers reporting team: Simon Goodley, Harry Davies, Luke Harding, Juliette Garside, David Conn, David Pegg, Paul Lewis, Caelainn Barr, Rowena Mason and Pamela Duncan in London; Ben Butler and Anne Davies in Sydney; Dominic Rushe in New York; Andrew Roth in Moscow; Helena Smith in Athens; Michael Safi in Lebanon; Robert Tait in Prague.\n\nGuardian",

          "title": "VAT controversy worsens govt revenue crisis",
          "text": "By OKEY ONYENWEAKU\n\nThis is not the best of times for the federal government. The country is in dire need of funds to run its affairs. Unfortunately, this is at a time when the economy is very clearly in a quite bad shape. First evidence: the N13.7trillion budget for 2021 is laden with a most sobering N5.2trillion (3.6% of GDP) budget deficit. At this rate how can government fund its infrastructure drive and other related operations?\n\nIndeed, the economic survival prospects of the country are becoming increasingly difficult by the day. The nation has barely survived two recessions in the last six years. The first recession lasted for 12 months in 2016 and then there was another brief one in 2020. This spate of set backs have in fact, been blamed on the plunge in the price of crude which is sold for about $77.13 pbd now and the fatal blow of Covid-19 that sank many economies.\n\nThe revenue target of the federal government in 2021 was N7.9 trillion. This represents 30 percent higher than the amount projected for the 2020 budget. Unfortunately, the Federal Government had at the same time projected the sum of 9.9 trillion expenditure for 2020, and spent about N10.08trn representing a 101 percent performance.\n\nWhile debt servicing for the year 2020 stood at N3.2 trillion, the sum of N3trillion was released for payment of salaries and pensions.\n\nIn critical terms also, the FG\u2019s projected revenue will further be depleted in 2021 because of the Value Added Tax (VAT) controversy.\n\nRivers State and Lagos State are already in the Supreme Court seeking to be allowed to collect the VAT that accrues from their states. Oyo was on its way to being joined in the suit as at press time. While other States are planning to sign laws to be allowed to collect VAT that accrues in their states, reports say that the Federal government has already lost billions. In summary, over 65 per cent of VAT collection comes from Lagos State. Tax payers are now confused whether to pay to the FG or to the States.\n\nAnalysts note that revenue generation remains a big challenge for the country in the face of fluctuating crude prices and volumes of production which is beyond its control in the face of economic contraction. There is also growing concern of an increasing budget deficit and rising debt.\n\nSo troubling is the situation for many an analyst as they have repeatedly observed that while the country owes N35trillion debt as at June 2021, the federal government spends over 90 per cent of its revenue to service debt. But the fiscal authorities remain insistent that they still have the control buttons in a good place.\n\nThe GDP only recorded a paltry growth of 5.1 per cent in half year 2021from a negative position of -6.10 in second quarter 2020. What this means is that even when there is an on paper growth, in real terms this really matters zilch as the indicators across all fronts continue to underscore..\n\nRecent statistics also reveal that the rate of unemployment, the second highest in the world is 33%; Underemployment rate stood at 22%; inflation which stood at 18.6 per cent has just eased to 17.01 per cent; diaspora remittances inflow in the country fell by 24 per cent from $5.6billion in 2020 to $4.2billion in half year 2021.\n\nRemittances had plunged 27 per cent year on year (YoY) to $17.2billion in 2020 from $23.55billion in 2019.\n\nMany have not forgotten that the operating environment last year was choking for almost all the business sectors including banks.\n\nThe major revenue earner for the country, crude oil price, which hovers between from $72 pbd and $75.46 pbd as at September 30, 2021 still fluctuates.\n\nInsecurity has not only hobbled agriculture, many parts of the Northern part of Nigeria have been taken over by bandits that not much business activities can subsist.\n\nWith the fearful scenario above, economic trajectory of the country is still uncertain.\n\nThis is because even the apex bank has warned that care must be taken to galvanize and push the economy out of slumber. The Apex regulator reportedly even warned its staff against unnecessary outings in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria for fear of kidnappers and bandits.\n\nWhereas the federal government said recently that it would require about $2.3 trillion cumulatively or $150 billion annually to upgrade the poor state of Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure, its revenue continues to shrink.\n\nThe capital expenditure budget of N3.85tn represents an increase of about 43% compared to 2020, and about 29% of total 2021 expenditure. The President indicated that there will be focus on completing ongoing projects across different sectors.\n\nAnalysts fear that the country is headed for a crisis if the economic policies are not fine-tuned to reposition and grow the critical sectors in the interest of every citizen.\n\nIntervening in this matter, Managing Director/CEO of Financial Derivatives Company limited, Mr.Bismarck Rewane who is also a member of the economic advisory council said the country\u2019s economy was headed for a crisis if the nation does not become deliberate with policies that would yield results.\n\nSpeaking at Alpha Morgan Capital\u2019s quarterly presentation on the Q3 & Q4 prognosis, Rewane said, \u2018\u2019Nigeria is facing a major economic crisis. The data you have is correct but it is not complete. It is what we call selected data that can justify certain things\u2019\u2019\n\nHe noted that electric cars would soon dominate the roads and reduce the carbon powered vehicles insinuating that crude which is the main income earner of Nigeria may no longer attract much forex in the near future.\n\nAccording to him, investor are weary and worried of high inflation adding that more economically stable countries now raise foreign loans at lower rates than Nigeria. The signs are ominous. But are we reading the lines",
          "summary": "First evidence: the N13.7trillion budget for 2021 is laden with a most sobering N5.2trillion (3.6% of GDP) budget deficit.\nThe revenue target of the federal government in 2021 was N7.9 trillion.\nThis represents 30 percent higher than the amount projected for the 2020 budget.\nIn critical terms also, the FG\u2019s projected revenue will further be depleted in 2021 because of the Value Added Tax (VAT) controversy.\nSpeaking at Alpha Morgan Capital\u2019s quarterly presentation on the Q3 & Q4 prognosis, Rewane said, \u2018\u2019Nigeria is facing a major economic crisis.",

          "text": "The recent expression of concern by the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, over the embarrassing delay by the South East Governors in formally setting off the Ebube Agu regional security outfit that is expected to add local security fillip to efforts at ensuring the safety of lives and citizens of the people of the region is most telling.\n\nAt a time when the security situation in the region has clearly continued to be most unsettling, it is apparent that going the whole hog in fully establishing Ebube Agu is one initiative that has to be given greater fillip and impetus by the governors of the region on whose laps the task falls.\n\nPart of the very strong rationale for establishing the force, its proponents have argued is that as an outfit that complements other existing security initiatives, it would be a practical way of putting more boots on ground in trying to address a growing challenge that needs to be addressed. Also the fact of its being a regionally-administered force should in an ideal situation help buy for it some basic local legitimacy that is very clearly required at a time like this.\n\nBeyond its mere establishment however, it is imperative that the governors of the region as core drivers of the project eschew partisanship and base calculations in the recruitment of the leaders and personnel for the outfit. This is more so when the outfit has already been plagued by an unexplainable time lag and delay in its proper take-off, the unceremonious resignation and non-replacement of its founding leader and the Chairman, South-East Security Committee, Major General Obi Umahi (retd.), as well as allegations that at least one of the governors in the region was already staffing it with partisans of a doubtful pedigree.\n\nIn our view, the critical need for Ebube Agu and the role it has to play in helping to ensure improved security in the region should be the only driving criteria for its existence, emergence, proper composition, staffing and smooth functioning. In addition, given the polarities that already exist on ground within the region, it is imperative that everything must be done to secure the buy in of the general public for the outfit and its operations. Without any equivocation, a lot would depend on public perception of Ebube Agu in the key areas of neutrality, non-partisanship and professionalism.\n\nAgain, one more reason why timeliness and credibility are critical to what the governors have to do in properly setting off the regional security outfit has to do with the fact that the security field in the region at the moment is quite a muddied one with soldiers, policemen, the ubiquitous \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 other criminals and operatives of the Eastern Security Network engaging in what is ostensibly a confused state of affairs. Such a situation is a waiting call for disaster, further disaster, recrimination and abuse. We should not let that happen. Leadership is needed to set the house in order and the onus lies on the governors of the region to man up to the occasion.\n\nWe equally note in particular also the political dimensions of the unfolding state of security hiatus in the region and its huge costs across board. In Anambra for example, elections are due to hold in the next few days and we are troubled over the credibility and acceptability of the outcome of that exercise within the current scenario. There is also an adjoining concern that fifth columnists could also latch in on the situation to hatch and incubate plots of an even more nefarious manner for both the region and nation. Our worries may be far-fetched. They may also not be. Whatever way it is seen, there remains eternal wisdom in the logic of the Igbo proverb that the pregnant she-goat does not suffer extended birth pangs when there are elders in the house.\n\nWe therefore join with Ohanaeze Ndigbo and other well-meaning Nigerians in urging the South East Governors to rise to the challenge and ensure that the Ebube Agu regional security outfit is fully and properly set up and optimally kitted to become fully functional in a matter of days, weeks and months. In addition, we urge that the Federal authorities continue to emphasise the instrumentality of far-reaching dialogue in its response to the crisis situation in the region. While the temptation may be there to let down the jackboots and compel peace through the use of unrelenting and uncompromising force, we want to caution that our history and experience teaches that such a tempting option may indeed contain no enduring solutions. Too much indeed is at stake. And now is the time very clearly to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. The people of the South East and Nigeria deserve nothing less at this time from their governing class.",

          "title": "Electricity crisis looms over N30bn monthly debt",
          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nBarring last minute change of mind, come January next year, the federal government will stop payment of subsidy on electricity currently put at N30 billion monthly.\n\nThe decision is also to affect all forms of subsidies hitherto extended to operators in the power sector value chain.\n\nThe move no doubt, sound as bad news to small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria, which, according to Pwc, \u201cis the backbone of major economies, as well as important contributors to employment, economic and export growth.\n\n\u201cIn South Africa, SMEs account for 91% of businesses, 60% of employment and contribute 52% of total GDP. In Nigeria, SMEs contribute 48% of national GDP, account for 96% of businesses and 84% of employment.\n\n\u201cDespite the significant contribution of SMEs to the Nigerian economy, challenges still persist that hinder the growth and development of the sector\u201d, says PwC\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics, SMEs in Nigeria contributed about 48% of the national GDP in the last five years. With a total number of about 17.4 million, they account for about 50% of industrial jobs and nearly 90% of the manufacturing sector in terms of number of enterprises.\n\nRuefully, in spite of the significant gains of small businesses, the announcement by the federal government to exit subsidy regime in power sector totalling N30 billion monthly may be an unsettling drawback to the growth of these enterprises, coming at a time when the government is also tilting towards full deregulation of the downstream sector of the nation\u2019s petroleum industry.\n\nThe news of subsidy removal filtered into public domain in July this year, and reaffirmed last week at a function in Lagos.\n\nAs from January 2022, the federal government will no longer pay the N30 billion electricity subsidy, meaning that Nigerians will have to pay more to get electricity.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Special Adviser to the President on infrastructure, Mr. Ahmed Zakari, at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement meeting organised by the Nigerian Electricity Commission (NERC) in Lagos.\n\nAccording to him, exiting its intervention in the power sector will allow the electricity market to run on its own, leaving demand and supply, and market participants to determine prices.\n\nThis is coming at a time when the country\u2019s power sector is facing a revenue shortfall due to a tariff regime that is not cost-reflective as data from the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) showed that the tariff being collected by distribution companies is below 50 per cent of their invoices.\n\nMr. Zakari, said: \u201cWe must move to a market where a person that buys power, pays for power. A Disco that buys power, pays for that power from the Genco that gives power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very simple. It\u2019s called commerce. Having middle structures in a way that promotes a lack of accountability does not work. And this administration is committed to making this a level playing field,\u201d he further said.\n\nPrior to the announcement government and labour unions had gone into extensive discussions on the implementation of the Service-Based Tariff in November 2020, where the NERC had promised improvement in service delivery to Nigerians.\n\nUnfortunately, there are indications that federal government pays for roughly 11 per cent of electricity consumption in the country despite other form of interventions by government in the power sector.\n\nAccording to Mr. Zakari, Nigeria has one of the poorest supplies of electricity despite the power sector contributing 78 per cent to GDP growth for the second quarter of 2021.\n\nAccording to the government, the subsidy on electricity which now amount to N30 billion is a N20 billion (40%) drop from N50 billion spent in February this year.\n\nSale Mamman, Minister of Power, said the funds were provided to augment the shortfall by the distribution companies (DisCos) who have failed to pay for the electricity supply sent to them.\n\nHe also attributed the decline in the subsidy to a minor increase in the tariff regime, which he said to its decreased by almost half, but still constitutes a serious drain on the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nRecall that vice President Yemi Osinbajo, had last July said the government expected the electricity sector to generate its revenue from the power sector market.\n\nThe VP noted that government would be investing over N43 billion in the coming years to improve transmission and distribution infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe power industry in Nigeria has reportedly been bogged down by claims of revenue shortfall allegedly due to a tariff regime that is \u201cnot cost reflective.\u201d Data from the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) shows that the tariff being collected by DisCos is below 50 per cent of their invoices.\n\nThe Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED) had consistently lamented that the absence of of a cost reflective remained one of the major setbacks confronting the sector.\n\nAccording to a document on the progress and overview of Nigeria\u2019s power sector by the ministry, the reduction (N20 billion) was achieved as a result of improvements in the collection of power tariffs by distribution companies (Discos), which has increased by about 60 percent.\n\n\u201cTariffs rose by 36 per cent from September 2020. Collections have grown by 60 per cent plus,\u201d the document read.\n\n\u201cGovernment subsidy has been reduced by N20bn per month. Record collections of N65bn hit in December 2020 cycle (from an average of N39bn).\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, in its recent Nigeria development update report, said regressive and opaque subsidies for fuel and electricity create economic distortions and reduce the fiscal space for development spending.\n\nThe Bank further said reducing both fuel and electricity subsidies are necessary to generate the fiscal space needed to continue supporting the COVID-19 response.\n\nExperts view\n\nHowever, analysts and stakeholders seem to see the government\u2019s decision from different perspectives.\n\nSpeaking with BusinessHallmark, Professor Adeagbo Moritiwon, a development economist said, \u201cthe issue of subsidy removal on electricity is not a bad idea in itself, but every policy decision must not be taken in isolation but within a context.\n\n\u201cIn the case of electricity, removing the subsidy at this time, and allowing the dictate of demand and supply will lead to unintended consequences. It will kill small businesses, impose further hardship on households, whose incomes have been affected by pandemic and economic meltdown.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with this medium, Professor Muhammed Ohiare of the department of Economics, Kogi State University said \u201cwhen you remove subsidy on electricity at this time, you are sounding a death kneel of small businesses, because it will impose much drain on the profit of these businesses, such removal can only make sense when the economic situation in the country has improved, and the DISCOS have stepped up their game with quality service delivery.\u201d\n\nAmbrose Omokordion, chief research officer at Investa told BusinessHallmark that \u201cit would amount to ill-advice at this period to remove the subsidy, it doesn\u2019t make sense because of the economic situation. It will further worsen the woes of small businesses and households who will be forced to pay more.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone that sees the timing as inauspicious, or the proposal as bad.\n\nSome analysts have supported the government\u2019s proposal, as they urged the federal government to stop spending N30 billion monthly on electricity subsidy.\n\nThe former executive secretary of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Dr. UjuOgubunka, urged the government to remove the subsidy and check excess tariffs by the operators.\n\n\u201cRemoval of electricity subsidy will breed competition and reduce inefficiency in the system. The regulator should be concerned with managing tariffs abuse,\u201dOgubunka said.\n\nIn the same vein, Titus Okurounmu, a former director of Central Bank of Nigeria, said the government could remove the subsidy but should not create another monopoly. He noted that the government should do more in harnessing other sources of energy in the country. \u201cGovernment should invest more in other energy sources so as to augment the inadequate electricity grid.\n\n\u201cHaving these alternative sources are most times environmentally friendly and will reduce reliance on the existing electricity network,\u201d he said.\n\nDr.OlufemiOmoyele, director of Entrepreneurship at the Redeemers University told this medium that \u201cgovernment should tread softly because of the social and economic implications of sudden removal, given the poverty in the land.\n\n\u201cThough, I support the removal but not at this period. You can only do that when the economy improves, and the material conditions of Nigerians are better. Remember there\u2019s pandemic that has affected businesses and incomes of households.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the idea of the Federal Government paying an estimated N30 billion every month as electricity subsidy is nothing but a pointer to an inherent dysfunction with the country\u2019s public electricity supply system, given that the sector has been privatised about eight years ago; and that services emanating from it is nothing but a huge deceit of the ordinary Nigerians.\n\nGovernment\u2019s plan to end subsidy payments to the sector according to him, will probably aggravate the power crisis. \u201cMy advice for government is to remove the subsidy on petrol and allow the one on electricity to stay for now\u201d, Omoyele said\n\nAchieving efficient generation and distribution of electricity in Nigeria has over the years remained a sore point and a major threat to growth of the economy. Poor electricity supply has serious consequences for the businesses in the country, with several existing companies struggling to maintain profitability and new players shying away from entering the market.\n\n\u201cThe government has undertaken several measures, including transferring majority of the power infrastructure from government to private hands; however, it has not managed to improve the situation. Ambitious policies and agreements with multinational energy companies might just be the key to solve Nigeria\u2019s energy problems\u201d, submitted Professor Moritiwon in his chat with BusinessHallmark.\n\nIn his reaction to the planned hike in electricity tariff, President, Consumer Rights Advancement Organisation (CRADO), Chief Adeolu Ogunbanjo, said consumers will mobilise the Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) against this insensitive pronouncement which is anti-people.\n\nIn his reaction, an economy expert, Mr.EzeOnyekpere, was quoted in the media as saying he does not see any reason government should subsidise the inefficiency of the GenCos and DisCos with public fund, stressing that such funds should be channeled into productive consumption.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying is that just as we supported the increase in VAT what we need to do is to free up resources for other infrastructure and development. And subsidy on electricity is one of the things that is taking the money which we don\u2019t even have.\n\n\u201cWhat I am advocating is conditional in terms of ensuring that these DisCos and GenCos and transmission company are run with the best corporate performance standard and run very efficiently.\n\n\u201cMy suggestion is for the citizens of this country to resist the companies whether through civil disobedience or litigation or media advocacy to ensure that they are run efficiently.\n\nWhile the former Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Muda Yusuf, argues that the Nigerian power sector situation is a complicated one. \u201cGenerating the liquidity to feed the power supply chain remains a major challenge. It is all the more worrisome because we have seen significant adjustments in tariffs over the last two years.\n\n\u201cThere is a large measure of discontent over the moves towards a cost effective tariff. Therefore, the push towards a full cost reflective tariff should be gradual to minimise the shocks on citizens and corporates. This has become even more necessary because of the frequency of tariff reviews that had taken place over the last one to two years.\u201d\n\nBusinessHallmark\u2019s finding revealed that the business of electricity generation and distribution is highly capital intensive. It is nevertheless dismaying that while the services of the distribution companies have been abysmal from the onset, their charges have been progressively prohibitive and starkly incommensurate with the services.\n\nThis government and its predecessors have been unwilling to liberalise the power sector for, among others, security reason; but it does not appear that respite will come to that sector until it is liberalised such that the states can take charge of their needs in terms of electricity.\n\nIt is safe to hold, from government\u2019s financial involvement in the sector since 1999, including the $16 billion allegedly spent during the administration of Olusegun Obasanjo, that the sector would likely consume just about any amount government throws into it without producing proportionate result.\n\nMany Nigerians who spoke with BusinessHallmark said the huge subsidy has not translated to better service delivery on the part of DISCOS.\n\nAdeola Ayayi, a banker told this medium that \u201cSo such huge subsidy is expended to subsidise power supply and yet there is no improvement even as millions of hapless electricity consumers are slammed with outrageous estimated electricity bills for power not supplied. I\u2019m ashamed of this country.\u201d\n\nThis view is shared by Martin Anyanwu, a clothes dealer, who said \u201cThis country is a scam, imagine paying N30 billion monthly subsidy without quality service delivery. Removing subsidy, will cripple our business, as DISCOs will jerk up their rate.\u201d\n\nNigeria is considered most abundant in natural reserves and is the largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa. The country has the potential to generate about 11,000-12,000 MW of electric power from existing plants. Despite this, Nigeria is only able to generate about 4,000 MW on most days, which is less than one-third of what is required to provide for its more than 190 million citizens.\n\nAccording to a 2014 World Bank survey, about 27% of Nigerian businesses identified electricity as the main hurdle in doing business.",

He said another 200 persons would jointly own 100 Toyota cars.\n\nZulum announced that all 2,200 beneficiaries would be required to repay only 50 per cent of the market value of the tricycles and cars, which they will generate from business while government will waive the remaining 50 per cent.\n\nThe governor directed the state\u2019s Ministry of Transportation to liaise with various unions of the tricycle operators to agree on suitable and acceptable modalities for the allocation. Zulum however, warned that, only deserving members who do not have tricycles should be considered.\n\nThe governor recalled that while government had banned the importation of tricycles into Maiduguri to curtail crimes and address congestions along the main roads, the coming intervention is based on need.\n\nHe further said all measures were in the best interest of the tricycle riders while acknowledging the employment opportunities it has provided.\n\nOne of the union leaders, Alhaji Hurso Grema, expressed appreciation to Governor Zulum for the coming intervention and for some regulatory measures introduced by the government which he said, had saved their occupation from incursions by bad elements who are using tricycles for criminal acts.",

It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "More than a dozen heads of state and government, from Jordan to Azerbaijan, Kenya, and the Czech Republic, have used offshore tax havens to hide assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a far-reaching new investigation by the ICIJ media consortium.\n\nThe so-called \u201cPandora Papers\u201d investigation \u2014 involving some 600 journalists from media including The Washington Post, the BBC and The Guardian \u2014 is based on the leak of some 11.9 million documents from 14 financial services companies around the world.\n\nSome 35 current and former leaders are featured in the latest vast trove of documents analysed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) \u2014 facing allegations ranging from corruption to money laundering and global tax avoidance.\n\nIn most countries, the ICIJ stresses, it is not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders.\n\nBut such revelations are no less of an embarrassment for leaders who may have campaigned publicly against tax avoidance and corruption, or advocated austerity measures at home.\n\nThe documents notably expose how Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II created a network of offshore companies and tax havens to amass a $100 million property empire from Malibu, California to Washington and London.\n\nThe Jordanian embassy in Washington declined to comment, but the BBC cited lawyers for the king saying all the properties were bought with personal wealth, and that it was common practice for high profile individuals to purchase properties via offshore companies for privacy and security reasons.\n\nFamily and associates of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev \u2014 long accused of corruption in the central Asian nation \u2014 are alleged to have been secretly involved in property deals in Britain worth hundreds of millions.\n\nAnd the documents also show how Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis \u2014 who faces an election later this week \u2014 failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase a chateau worth $22 million in the south of France.\n\n\u201cI have never done anything illegal or wrong,\u201d Babis hit back in a tweet, calling the revelations a smear attempt aimed at influencing the election.\n\n\u2013 Tony Blair And Shakira \u2013\n\nIn total, the ICIJ found links between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including more than a dozen serving heads of state and government, country leaders, cabinet ministers, ambassadors and others.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nNearly two million of the 11.9 million leaked documents came from prestigious Panamanian law firm Aleman, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), which the ICJ said had become \u201ca magnet for the rich and powerful from Latin America and beyond seeking to hide wealth offshore.\u201d\n\nAlcogal, whose clients allegedly included the Jordanian monarch and Czech prime minister, rejected accusations of shady dealings, saying it was considering legal action to defend its reputation.\n\n\u201cI guess it mostly demonstrates that the people that could end the secrecy of offshore, could end what\u2019s going on, are themselves benefiting from it,\u201d the ICIJ\u2019s director Gerard Ryle said in a video accompanying the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at trillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nFor Maira Martini, a policy expert with Transparency International, the latest investigation once more offers \u201cclear evidence of how the offshore industry promotes corruption and financial crime, while obstructing justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis business model cannot go on,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong the other revelations from the ICIJ investigation:\n\nFormer British prime minister Tony Blair, who has been critical of tax loopholes, is shown to have legally avoided paying stamp duty on a multi-million-pound property in London when he and his wife Cherie bought the offshore company that owned it.\n\nMembers of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s inner circle, including cabinet ministers and their families, are said to secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars. In a series of tweets, Khan vowed to \u201ctake appropriate action\u201d if any wrongdoing by Pakistani citizens is established.\n\nVladimir Putin is not directly named in the files, but he is linked via associates to secret assets in Monaco, notably a waterfront home acquired by a Russian woman believed to have had a child with the Russian leader, The Washington Post reports.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta \u2014 who has campaigned against corruption and for financial transparency \u2014 is alleged along with several family members of secretly owning a network of offshore companies.\n\nAs well as politicians, the public figures exposed included the Colombian singer Shakira, the German supermodel Claudia Schiffer and the Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. Representatives for all three told the ICIJ the investments were legitimate and denied tax avoidance.\n\nThe \u201cPandora Papers\u201d are the latest in a series of mass ICIJ leaks of financial documents, from LuxLeaks in 2014, to the 2016 Panama Papers \u2014 which triggered the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and paved the way for the leader of Pakistan to be ousted.\n\nThey were followed by the Paradise Papers in 2017 and FinCen files in 2020.\n\nAFP",

No. We are practicing election-ocracy, that is my new term for it. What do I mean by election-ocracy?

Five other members were absent.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 strike had almost crippled the country\u2019s health sector.\n\nA reliable source at the meeting told THISDAY last night that the leadership of NARD has been mandated to address the media today (Monday) on the decision to suspend the strike and to give the modalities and new timelines for further engagement with the federal government team.\n\n\u201cNARD decided after detailed assessment of its engagement with the federal government, to suspend the strike embarked upon on August 2, 2021. Majority of the NEC members voted in support of the suspension of the industrial action and to give the government another chance to redeem its promises with regards to the implementation of Memoradum of Understanding with the doctors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Resident doctors had gone strike to demand the implementation of the Memoradum of Agreement they reached with federal government and to protest the alleged non-payment of arrears of salaries and allowances to some of their members.\n\nThe doctors also sought the immediate release of their residency training fund and for the placement of their members in the appropriate salary structure.\n\nAfter series of negotiations failed to resolve the dispute, the federal government took the matter to the National Industrial Court for resolution.\n\nHowever, NARD had come under pressure from several quarters to suspend the prolonged strike action, which has had a biting effect on Nigerians.\n\nAmong those who mounted pressure on the Resident doctors to suspend their action was the parent body, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA).\n\nNMA, when it led the new national executive of NARD on a courtesy visit to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, had said the continuation of the strike was no longer necessary.\n\n\u201cWe cannot pretend that all is well. We had to look at some of the things that have unraveled since 2nd August. As you know, I\u2019m a man of peace and my leadership is for peace.

          "text": "Fumio Kishida was elected Japan\u2019s prime minister in a parliamentary vote Monday and will be tasked with quickly tackling the pandemic and other domestic and global challenges and leading a national election within weeks.\n\nWith his party and its coalition partner holding a majority in both houses, Kishida won by a comfortable margin against Yukio Edano, head of the largest opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. Kishida and his new Cabinet will be sworn in at a palace ceremony later in the day.\n\nHe replaces Yoshihide Suga, who resigned after only one year in office as his support plunged over his government\u2019s handling of the pandemic and insistence on holding the Tokyo Olympics as the virus spread.\n\nA former foreign minister, Kishida, 64, used to be known as a dovish moderate but turned hawkish apparently to win over influential conservatives in the Liberal Democratic Party. He is firmly entrenched in the conservative establishment, and his victory in last week\u2019s vote to replace Suga as the party\u2019s leader was a choice for continuity and stability over change.\n\nKishida will replace all but two of 20 Cabinet posts under Suga and 13 are being appointed to ministerial posts for the first time, Japanese media reported. Most of the posts went to powerful factions that voted for Kishida in the party election. Only three women are reportedly included, up from two in Suga\u2019s government.\n\nForeign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi are to be retained, ensuring continuity of Japan\u2019s diplomacy and security policies as the country seeks to closely work with Washington under the bilateral security pact in the face of China\u2019s rise and growing tensions in the region, including around Taiwan.\n\nKishida supports stronger Japan-U.S. security ties and partnerships with other like-minded democracies in Asia, Europe and Britain, in part to counter China and nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nKishida is to create a new Cabinet post aimed at tackling economic dimensions of Japan\u2019s national security, appointing 46-year-old Takayuki Kobayashi, who is relatively new to parliament.\n\nJapan faces growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea, which last month test-fired ballistic missiles capable of hitting targets in Japan. Kishida also faces worsening ties with fellow U.S. ally South Korea over history issues even after he struck a 2015 agreement with Seoul to resolve a row over the issue of women who were sexually abused by Japan\u2019s military during World War II.\n\nAn urgent task at home will be turning around his party\u2019s sagging popularity, hurt by Suga\u2019s perceived high-handedness on the pandemic and other issues. Kishida is expected to make a policy speech later this week before dissolving the lower house of Parliament ahead of the general election expected by mid-November.\n\nHe\u2019ll also have to ensure Japan\u2019s health care systems, vaccination campaign and other virus measures are ready for a possible resurgence of COVID-19 in winter, while gradually normalizing social and economic activity.\n\nKishida said last week that his top priority would be the economy. Kishida\u2019s \u201cnew capitalism\u201d is largely a continuation of Abe\u2019s economic policies. He aims to raise income of more people and create a cycle of growth and distribution.\n\nA third-generation politician, Kishida was first elected to Parliament in 1993 representing Hiroshima and is an advocate for nuclear disarmament. He escorted former President Barack Obama during his 2016 visit to the city that, along with Nagasaki, was destroyed in U.S. atomic bombings in the closing days of World War II.",

          "text": "A large oil spill off the southern California coast left fish dead, birds mired in petroleum and wetlands contaminated, prompting local officials to call it an environmental catastrophe.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, heading a clean-up response involving federal, state and city agencies, said on Sunday there was an around-the-clock investigation into how the spill occurred.\n\nAn estimated 126,000 gallons, or 3,000 barrels, had spread into an oil slick covering about 13 square miles of the Pacific Ocean since it was first reported on Saturday morning, said Kim Carr, the mayor of Huntington Beach, at a press conference.\n\nShe called the spill an \u201cenvironmental catastrophe\u201d and a \u201cpotential ecological disaster\u201d. The beachside city, about 40 miles (65 km) south of Los Angeles, was bearing the brunt of the spill.\n\nCarr added: \u201cOur wetlands are being degraded and portions of our coastline are now covered in oil.\u201d\n\nThe spill was caused by a breach connected to the Elly oil rig and stretched from the Huntington Beach Pier down to Newport Beach, a stretch of coast popular with surfers and sunbathers.\n\nCarr said the oil rig was operated by Beta Offshore, a California subsidiary of Houston-based Amplify Energy Corporation (AMPY.N). Calls to Beta and Amplify went unanswered.\n\nCarr, in her remarks, added: \u201cIn the coming days and weeks we challenge the responsible parties to do everything possible to rectify this environmental catastrophe.\u201d\n\nAmplify Energy CEO Martyn Willsher said at a press conference in Long Beach that the pipeline had been shut off and remaining oil suctioned out. He said divers were still trying to determine where and why the spill occurred.\n\nU.S. Representative Michelle Steel, a Republican representing part of the affected area, sent a letter to Democratic President Joe Biden requesting a major disaster declaration for Orange County, which would free up federal funds to help with the clean-up efforts.\n\nSteel later told CNN: \u201cThis is a really serious disaster\u201d.\n\nCottie Petrie-Norris, a Democratic state assembly member representing some areas affected by the spill, said she had \u201chuge concerns\u201d about the extent of the damage to the environment, communities and local economy.\n\nShe told CNN the spill was a \u201ccall to action that we need to stop drilling off our precious California coast.\u201d\n\nOil production off California\u2019s coast has declined sharply since its peak in the 1990s, in part due to the state\u2019s strict environmental rules. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said he wants to end oil drilling in the state by 2045.\n\nOffshore drilling was restricted in the state after a devastating 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara that dumped 80,000 barrels into the ocean. More recently another spill off Santa Barbara in 2015 sent as much as 2,400 barrels onto the shore and into the Pacific.\n\nOceana, an ocean conservation group, also called for an end to offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nJacqueline Savitz, Oceana\u2019s chief policy officer, said in a statement: \u201cThis is just the latest tragedy of the oil industry. It\u2019s well past time to prevent future oil spills by permanently protecting our coasts from offshore drilling.\u201d\n\nThe spill occurred in federal waters. Officials said federal, state and city agencies were involved in a response headed by the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nOn Sunday, Orange County supervisor Katrina Foley said the oil had infiltrated the Talbert Marsh, a large ecological reserve, causing \u201csignificant damage.\u201d\n\nBeaches were closed to swimming and a local air show was canceled, although some people were undeterred from setting up chairs on the beach to enjoy a sunny Sunday or strolling along the pier.\n\nCarr said officials had deployed 2,050 feet (625 meters) of protective booms, which help contain and slow the oil flows.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, working with local and state agencies, flew airplanes to assess the spill and had hired contractors to clean it up.\n\nOfficials said they were investigating the cause of the spill and the type of oil involved.",

          "title": "Nigeria Spends $2bn on Wheat Importation Annually, Central Bank Says",
          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Sunday revealed that the importation of wheat costs the country about $2 billion annually, thereby exerting pressure on the country\u2019s food import bill.\n\nThis is just as the CBN has stated that the much-awaited Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), known as the eNaira would improve monetary policy effectiveness and enhance government\u2019s capacity to deploy targeted social interventions and boost remittances through formal channels.\n\nAlso, in what appears to be a setback for the country\u2019s cashless policy, a Federal High Court in Awka, has said it was not proper for the CBN as a federal institution to adopt discriminatory policies in its operations.\n\nCommenting on the country\u2019s food import bill, the central bank stated that wheat was its second highest contributor with over five million Metric Tons (MT) imported yearly.\n\nThe apex bank however, restated its commitment to addressing the existing challenges in the wheat value chain as part of efforts to shore up the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nThis was made known by the CBN Director, Development Finance Department, Mr. Philip Yila Yusuf, at the Wheat Conference and Stakeholder Engagement, with the theme: \u201cImproving and Sustaining the Wheat Value Chain Development in Nigeria,\u201d in Abuja.\n\nHe noted that the wheat value chain had enormous potential for ground-breaking impact in the agricultural sector, adding that the central bank would focus attention on the commodity value chain for 2021/2022 dry season planting following the sustainable progress made across the rice and maize value chain.\n\nThe CBN director, further estimated that only one per cent or 63,000MT of wheat, out of the 5-6 MT consumed annually, was produced locally.\n\nHe said the CBN intervention had become critical due to the high demand for wheat in the country as well as the inability to meet that demand.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN plans to address key problems in the value chain through financing massive production of wheat in Nigeria and seeks to facilitate sustained availability of high yield seed variety in country and improve general productivity.\u201d\n\nWhile admitting the enormous challenge before the bank, which would require concerted efforts to address, he assured stakeholders of the CBN\u2019s readiness in changing the narrative in the sector by working with relevant industry players.\n\nHowever, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mohammed Abubakar, expressed dismay that the country\u2019s wheat importation had continued to increase in recent years, urging stakeholders to collaborate to reverse by investing more in the value chain.\n\nAlso speaking at the occasion, Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, charged stakeholders in the wheat value chain to be transparent in their dealings and to commence preparation for both farming and production of wheat.\n\nThe governor commended the CBN for its efforts in boosting the commodity value chain and encouraged the bank to expedite action in releasing funds.\n\nRepresented by the Kano State Deputy Governor, Dr. Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, Ganduje emphasised that partnership among stakeholders in wheat production value chains remained critical in boosting the country\u2019s quest to be self-sufficient in the production of wheat.\n\nEarlier in March, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had indicated that the bank remained committed to improving local production of wheat and reducing importation by 60 per cent over the next two years.\n\nOn the eNaira, in its Regulatory Guidelines obtained by THISDAY, the apex bank said the initiative would improve monetary policy effectiveness and enhance government\u2019s capacity to deploy targeted social interventions and boost remittances through formal channels.\n\nThe bank explained that that eNaira wallet was required to access, use and hold the digital currency.\n\nThe CBN also tasked the deposit money banks (DMBs) to facilitate prompt placement of restriction on eNaira wallets in the event of valid report of loss, theft of device or compromise, hack of a user eNaira wallet.\n\nAccording to the Regulatory Guidelines on the eNaira, the apex bank further directed banks to ensure that customers are able to report via USSD channels, internet banking platforms, customer care phone lines, and in-branch customer care where there is any compromise in the eNaira transactions.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had said in unveiling the digital money, the bank does not downplay potential risks, adding however that the apex financial regulatory body had put in place appropriate mitigation mechanisms for safer operation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are not going to pretend that there are no risks in opening your system up. We will look at the various products, determine the risks, determine the best way to mitigate the risks before opening it up.\n\n\u201cBut it is a journey that we are determined and decided that we will start on October 2021.\u201d\n\nThe planned unveiling of the CBDC originally slated for October 1, 2021, was put on hold due to other key activities lined up to commemorate the country\u2019s 61st independence anniversary.\n\nHowever, the CBN, in the framework for the operation of the eNaira further set the transaction and balance limits for individual and merchant eNaira wallets.\n\nIn the Tier 0 category or phone number without verified National Identity Number (NIN), daily transaction is limited to N20,000 with balance or eWallet limit set at N120,000.\n\nFor the Tier 1 category with verified National Identity Number (NIN), daily transaction limit is set at N50,000 with N300,000 balance.\n\nHowever, those in the Tier 2 category would be able to transaction up to N200,000 on a daily basis with eWallet balance of N500,000 while Tier 3 would have daily transactions of N1 million with balances of N5 million.\n\nHowever, merchants, or duly accredited individuals and non-individual (corporates) authorised to conduct business in Nigeria will have no limits on eNaira transactions.\n\nThe CBN also stated that under the digital currency framework, Financial Institutions (FIs) shall render returns to the bank in line with the provisions of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 2020 and as may be specified from time to time.\n\nThe guidelines, among other things, said FIs shall put in place appropriate measures to ensure sound risk management practices to address potential threats to their operations.\n\nThese include an enterprise risk management framework; Appropriate governance structures,; Documented and approved policies; and Secured information technology infrastructure.\n\nIt said, \u201cFinancial Institutions shall be required to implement additional risk management measures as may be prescribed by CBN guidelines from time to time.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines stipulated role and responsibilities of the different stakeholders particularly with respect to ensuring the prevention or minimisation of loss following loss, theft of a user\u2019s device or compromise, hack of user eNaira wallet.\n\nMeanwhile, on the cashless matter, the court presided over by Justice Nnamdi Dimgba made the pronouncement in a judgment delivered in a suit filed against the CBN over alleged imposition of discriminatory bank charges on some categories of cash depositors.\n\nDepositors affected by the said discriminatory policy were those lodging N500,000 above in bank accounts domiciled in selected six states and the FCT.\n\nA legal practitioner, Chijioke Ifediora, who was a victim of the CBN discriminatory policy decided to challenge its legality and filed Suit FHC/AWK/CS/91/2020, arguing that the discriminatory bank charges was ultra vires, illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nThe CBN had in line with its cashless policy initiatives, imposed the contentious charges via two separate Circulars, BPS/DIR/GEN/CIR/04/004 and PSM/DIR/CON/CWO/02/014 dated 20th April 2017 and 17th September 2019 respectively.\n\nBut the plaintiff had urged the court to consider the provisions of Sections 1 (3 ) , 2 ( 1) and Section 42 of the constitution of Nigeria, 1999 ( as amended), in order to determine whether the said two CBN circulars were not discriminatory, ultra vires, unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nHe had stated that he took the decision to drag the CBN to court when on January 7th, 2020, he went to a bank at Amawbia Awka, Anambra State, to make cash lodgment of N600,000 into his account. According to him, a bank official told him that he would not be allowed to effect the deposit without paying the charge in accordance with the CBN circular PSM/DIR/CON/CWO/02/014.\n\nHe, therefore, asked the court to grant him three reliefs, namely, that the said two CBN circulars were ultra vires, unconstitutional and illegal and were in conflict with Section 1(3), Section 2(1) and Section 42 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nThe third relief sought by the plaintiff is that the charges emanating from the implementation of the two CBN Circulars are illegal and unlawful.\n\nConsequently, the plaintiff urged the court to make five Declaratory Orders compelling the CBN to refund illegal or unlawful charges imposed on all citizens and corporate bodies operating in Anambra, who were victims of the implementation of the said circulars. Others included the refund of all citizens and corporate bodies operating in Anambra, Abia, Lagos, Ogun, Kano, Rivers and FCT who were also allegedly made to pay the illegal or unlawful charges by the implementation of the CBN circulars; order a perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant (CBN) from publishing or issuing circulars or implementing similar policies that are discriminatory or in conflict with Section 42 of the constitution, restraining all financial institutions and deposit money banks from implementing similar discriminatory policies and lastly, direct the CBN to make a reversal publication of the implementation of the said circulars in five national newspapers indicating compliance with the Decision of Court and refund of the unlawful charges.\n\nIn his submission, counsel for the CBN, Chief Musa M. Tolani, an Aba-based legal practitioner, argued that the plaintiff lacked the locus standi to file the Suit, describing him as a meddlesome interloper, since he did not have the authority of all the citizens and corporate institutions residing in the affected states.\n\nHe also stated that the plaintiff failed to show how the policy affected him injuriously more than the rest of the residents of the states being sought to be protected.\n\nTolani added that the policy was introduced to facilitate the implementation of the CBN well intentioned and worthy cashless policy for the overall well-being of the federation economy.\n\nHowever, delivering his judgment, Justice Dimgba was inclined to agree with the plaintiff that the CBN policy was discriminatory ab initio before its eventual general application across the federation, hence the suit was challenging the lawfulness of the action of the CBN, which is a federal government agency\n\nThough he agreed with the plaintiff on the first three reliefs sought and affirmed that the CBN policy was discriminatory and offended section 42 of the 1999 constitution (as amended) the judge declined to grant the five consequential Orders.\n\nJustice Nnamdi explained that the refusal to grant the five consequential orders were no longer necessary since it was admitted during oral evidence that the CBN policy is now implemented nationwide.\n\nAlex Enumah and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company Limited has instituted a legal action against Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, seeking the sum of over $2.5 billion compensation over the sales of Oil Mining Licence 29.\n\nAiteo in the court action dated July 27, 2021 as accusing Shell of selling two Marginal Fields \u2013 Kugbo West and Okiori to it when it, \u201cknew or ought to have known that the defendant had handed over the wells to the federal government of Nigeria\\Nigerian national petroleum corporation for which the defendant received valuable consideration in or about 2009 prior to the agreement for assignment.\n\nThe plaintiff in the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/C8/738/2021, and filed by its lawyer, Kemi Pinheiro, SAN, is claiming that the defendant breached a fundamental term of the agreement for assignment dated October 17, 2014 as set out in schedule 1 part 3 \u2013 wells, in relation to the Kugbo West and Okiori oil well s listed in schedule 1 of the agreement for assignment.\n\nShell was the legal and beneficial holder of a 30 per cent undivided participating interest in OML 29, which is part of the undivided percentage interest held by the defendant in conjunction with TEPING, NAOC, NNPC amongst others.\n\nPrior to the assignment of the lease to Aiteo, Shell as the operator of OML 29 published Information Memorandum in October 2013 wherein it invited bids from interested entities for the acquisition of their joint undivided 45 percent participating interest in OML 29.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed it did not only join others to bid for OML 29 but emerged successful.\n\n\u201cAs consideration for the agreement, the plaintiff made the following respective payments of; $220,000,000.00 as deposit pending the negotiation, completion and execution of the transaction documents and relevant agreements and the balance of 2,130,000,000.00 upon the execution of the transaction and acquisition documents and the agreement,\u201d it stated.\n\nPlaintiff further averred that based on the agreement for assignment dated October 17, 2014, the defendant in conjunction with TEPING and NOAC as Assignors transferred to it their entire participating interest in OML 29 together with the rights, interest, obligations thereto and in the process purportedly also transferred their participating interest in the wells, \u201cwhen they knew or ought to have known that they had surrendered and given the wells to the NNPC/ the federal government about five years earlier for valuable consideration\u201d.\n\nWhile Aiteo claimed its bid for the acquisition of OML 29 was based upon a complete reliance on the representations in the electronic data room information, IM and the Agreement, particularly as they concern the wells contained within OML 29, it noted that issues came up in 2020 when it wanted to commence work on the assigned wells.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff found that the wells had been earlier, re-conveyed by the defendant to the NNPC on or about 2009,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the plaintiff the said re-conveyance of the wells were done (ostensibly by way of offsetting the defendant\u2019s incurred liabilities to the NNPC under the JOA operated by the defendant, adding that the wells were then offered to prospective buyers during the just concluded 2020 bid round conducted by the Department of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances therefore, the plaintiff avers that the representations made by the defendant as aforesaid were made falsely, deceitfully and fraudulently with the intention of depriving the plaintiff the full benefit of the assets and the undivided 45 percent participating interest in the wells,\u201d it claimed.\n\nPlaintiff further claimed that as a result of the deceit, its expectations as it relates to the wells can no longer be achieved and that its financial position has been severely and adversely impacted upon.\n\nPlaintiff averred that its inability to fully repay its alleged indebtedness to its financiers was directly attributed to the wrongful actions of Shell. While claiming that it paid the sum of $46.2 million for the wells, plaintiff argued if the money had been invested in other business ventures at the rate of 9.9 per cent interest rate per annum from 2014 till the commencement of the suit it would have yielded an additional sum of $52 million.\n\nPlaintiff therefore claimed that it is entitled to a refund of $99 million.\n\nIt also argued that although by clause 25 of the agreement, disputes emanating from the said agreement ought to be resolved through arbitration but since the fraudulent misrepresentation of the defendant goes to the root of the agreement to the sales of the wells it can not be entertained or determined by an arbitration tribunal.\n\nAiteo is therefore praying the Federal High Court to order Shell to refund him the sum of $46.2 million as payment attributable to Kugbo West and Okiori oil wells being money had and received for a consideration which has totally failed.\n\nPlaintiff is also asking for another sum of $52 million being the interest that ought to have accrued on the sum paid on the two wells.\n\nWhile it is claiming the sum of $500,000 general damages, it is also seeking the payment of $2.1 billion as the amount it would have derived from the sales of 32,000,000 barrels of crude oil and other petroleum products from the Kugbo West and 41,000,000 barrels of crude oil and other petroleum products from Okiori wells.\n\nIn 2015, shell reported that it had completed the assignment of its interest in oil OML 29 and the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (OML29 and NCTL) to Aiteo in total cash proceeds of some $1.7 billion.\n\nIt stated that the divestment was part of the strategic review of SPDC\u2019s onshore portfolio and in line with the federal government\u2019s aim of developing Nigerian companies in the country\u2019s upstream oil and gas business.\n\nOML29 covers an area of 983 square kilometres and includes the Nembe, Santa Barbara and Okoroba fields and related facilities and has a capacity of 600 thousand barrels per day.\n\nIn February this year, a Federal Court in Lagos, had issued an injunction barring Shell subsidiaries from withdrawing money in 20 local banks until it \u2018ringfences\u2019 potential damages in a lawsuit brought against the oil major by Aiteo.\n\nIn the case, the company was seeking about $4 billion in total over alleged problems over claims Shell undercounted its oil exports through deliberate improper metering of the Nigerian company\u2019s oil exports from the Bonny Light terminal.\n\nChuks Okocha",
