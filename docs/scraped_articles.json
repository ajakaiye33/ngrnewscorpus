          "title": "Group campaigns against media profiling of PWDs",
          "text": "A non-governmental organisation, Theseabilities Foundation, has called on journalists and media practitioners to desist from use of words or expressions that amount to profiling while reporting about persons with disabilities.\n\nThe call was made on Friday at a webinar titled, \u2018Acceptable Use of Language around the Disability Community,\u2019 organised by Theseabilities Foundation in collaboration with The PUNCH Media Foundation.\n\nAt the webinar, advocates and participants sought better ways to navigate through language when referring to persons with disabilities.\n\nThe Executive Director, Theseabilities Foundation, Adetoye Abioye, said stakeholders and society at large should have a change of mindset and perspective towards persons with disabilities and encourage a change.\n\n\u201cStakeholders identified include parents, families, places of worship, non-governmental organisations, businesses and workplaces in our communities.\n\n\u201cWe believe that mindsets and perspectives toward persons with disabilities can be encouraged to change for the better.\u201d\n\nA London-based social worker, Mrs Grace Alexander, noted that some words used to refer to PWDs were hurtful and displayed \u2018society\u2019s power play\u2019.\n\nAlexander said, \u201cThis is particularly evident in commentaries and reporting of events and stories about persons with disabilities. There is a need to use globally-enhancing language and reporting around the disability community.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Chairman, Punch Nigeria Limited, Mrs Angela Emuwa, submitted that words had power, stressing that society must recognise that PWDs are first humans before anything else.\n\nRecounting an experience she had in Ikorodu, Lagos, Emuwa, who doubles as the President, Autism Parents Association International, said, \u201cMy team and I had gone in search of a school with special needs around Ikorodu and had to ask some people who said there were no school there except the ones for \u2018imbeciles\u2019.\n\n\u201cI was taken aback by that word use as it was so derogatory and should not be used by anyone to refer to another human being. I had to tell them that they couldn\u2019t use such a term to refer to people\u2019s children, God\u2019s creation. This further shows the perception of society concerning PWDs.\n\n\u201cLanguage, being a societal construct, shows power play and the right words must be used when referring to the disability community.\u201d\n\nThe mom of a 27-year-old man with a disability, said, \u201cWhen addressing persons with disabilities, ask yourself: Does language convey power? What meaning does the word convey to that person? As a professional, how do you refer to these persons? There has not been a universal language or word.\n\n\u201cOne of the things you must bear in mind when addressing PWDs is that the language must convey respect, dignity. Some words or sentences are like labelling. Remove the stigma and barrier around these words.\n\n\u201cSome doctors still use words like \u2018retarded\u2019, \u2018handicapped\u2019, \u2018mad\u2019? When we speak of accommodations, we don\u2019t have to use \u2018wheelchair-bound\u2019. Instead say something like \u2018wheelchair user\u2019 or \u2018person on wheels\u2019. Instead of saying \u2018disability parking lot or disabled parking lot\u2019, use \u2018accessible parking space\u2019.\n\n\u201cSome words like \u2018special needs\u2019 are also derogatory. Some schools of thoughts disagree with people using that phrase. I particularly do not feel comfortable using that phrase because it seems you are segregating. We are all humans intentionally created by God and we are unique. Each one of us has some needs that are additional. Some we cannot see them; others, we can see.\n\n\u201cWhen you use a word, ask yourself what perspective the usage is coming from. Is it a perspective of tragedy? Is it a perspective of pity? Is it from cultural perceptions? The most important thing is that the UPRD agreed that it has to be the person first and then you mention the diagnosis.\u201d\n\nAnother speaker, Ndifreke \u2018Freky\u2019 Andrew Essien, the Head of Faecae Foundation, gave a list of derogatory words not to be used for PWDs to include \u2018mad, deranged, mentally-challenged, dumb, dwarf, blind, deaf, wheelchair-bound, afflicted.\u2019\n\nShe said, \u201cInstead of \u2018mad\u2019, say \u2018intellectual disabilities\u2019; instead of dumb, say \u2018speech difficulties or speaking difficulties; instead of blind, say \u2018visual impairment\u2019; instead of wheelchair-bound, say \u2018wheelchair user\u2019 because those who use their legs are not \u2018leg-bound\u2019.\u201d.\n\nIn attendance was the President of the Association of Lawyers with Disabilities in Nigeria, Mr Daniel Onwe, amongst others.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He told me it\u2019s the turn of the South East. So when people like us appeared, he has always been very positive.\n\nObasanjo believed that the time has come to bring total reconciliation to Nigeria. He also believed that there are a lot of things the South East can bring to the table beyond bringing unity to the country.\n\n\u201cHe believed that the South East can model hard work and entrepreneurship which will help in wealth creation, and fight against poverty that Nigeria is. The first day I met him, he gave me the list of challenges that I would face and also gave me a list of how to solve them. And I have followed some of those tips and they have worked for me.\n\n\u201cSo he told me that it\u2019s a tough job and that he\u2019s happy I have endured up till today and looking forward to final realization of that vision of his to see Nigeria being united and restored to a country that all of us will be proud to call our own.\u201d\n\nThe former chairman of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, MAN, stated that the only way to maintain proper peace in a nation of diverse ethnicities and geographics like Nigeria was to ensure that everybody is treated fairly.\n\n\u201cAnd rotation and power-sharing are some of the methods of ensuring inclusiveness and making sure that Nigerians feel they are part of the country.

These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201dBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate,\u201d the President warned.\n\n\u201dAs the country prepares for the long run up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that the APC started out with a confidence of victory and the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\nThis alone, addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\nThe party, he went on to note, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition Governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No-one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\u201cOf course the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.\u201d",

It is the role of the church to sensitise and encourage their members to actively participate in politics\u201d.\n\n\u201cChristians are not up to 5 percent of those in politics. The church must wake to its responsibility. They must raise Christians with an untainted character who will rescue Nigeria from the doom we are heading to.\n\n\u201cThe church must also mobilise their members towards nation-building. The nation\u2019s democratic system has been bastardised by the people in power, they have destroyed our democracy and until Christians with Integrity join politics, things will remain the same\u201d, Iyunade said.\n\nHe noted that the forthcoming 2023 election would amount to a waste of insufficient and unavailable resources, if the election fails to produce the right set of leaders.\n\nThe cleric accused the political class of contributing to the challenges of insecurity bedeviling the country.\n\nHe called for the withdrawal of security operatives attached to VIPs and politicians, arguing that \u201cNigeria will not be safe until politicians no longer feel secured.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsecurity in the nation will persist as the architects and sponsors of insecurity are still on the ground. Unless they leave, insecurity cannot be combated.\n\n\u201cInsecurity is an instrument in the hands of some politicians\u201d, the cleric alleged.\n\nSpeaking on the state of the nation, Iyunade noted that the current hardship being experienced in the country is deliberately caused by the present administration, describing it as a political weapon created to \u2018weakened the masses\u2019, positing that we are in a political war in Nigeria.\n\nHe called on the government at the state and federal levels to create enabling environment for small and medium scale businesses to thrive, through the provision of loans and the formulation of policies to encourage them.",

Atiku Abubakar defected and the case was contested to Supreme Court and he won and retained his seat.\n\n\u201cWhat PDP is trying to do is to distract us here and there. I am using this opportunity to tell all Ebonyians to stand firm and support David Umahi to finish his tenure.

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has called on the federal government to treat the current fuel scarcity in the country as a national emergency and immediately arrest the situation.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe Congress in a statement signed by its President, Ayuba Wabba on Friday, warned that there is a limit to which the people can endure the current hardship occasioned by the scarcity of refined petroleum products.\n\nThe congress further advised the government to make judicious use of the bumper harvest of petro-dollars to fix the nation\u2019s oil refineries\n\nIt reiterated its stance that local refining of petroleum is the answer to fuel subsidy challenges the government is complaining about.\n\nThe statement read in parts, \u201cIt is with great pain, sadness and alarm that the Nigeria Labour Congress observes the continued acute scarcity of petroleum products at different filling stations in the country. A crisis that started with the supply of sub-standard Premium Motor Oil (PMS) has now degenerated into a persisting scarcity of not only PMS but also other petroleum products such as Diesel and Aviation Fuel. It is deeply disturbing that motorists, keke operators, bike riders and other users of petrol products now spend incredibly long hours at filling stations before being serviced or sent away empty-handed. This is indeed a daylight premiere of unending episodes of nightmare.\n\n\u201cCurrently, a litre of aviation fuel sells as high as N580 while a litre of diesel goes as high as N625. In many parts of the country, a litre of PMS goes as high as N220. The socio-economic strain of both the scarcity and the high cost of petroleum products on ordinary Nigerians and manufacturing firms is best imagined. In many parts of Nigeria, manufacturing has ground to a halt. The current hemorrhage induced by the prevailing scarcity of petroleum products has very grave concomitant effects on the already perilous unemployment and security situation in our country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cConsequent on the foregoing, the Nigeria Labour Congress cautions that there is an extent to which the people can endure the current hardship occasioned by the scarcity of refined petroleum products. There is a limit the people can stomach prevailing disruptions caused by petrol scarcity especially increased fares and associated dislocations in land, air, rail and water transportation and indeed hiccups in the manufacturing sector all linked to the current scarcity of refined petroleum products in the country.\n\n\u201cThis scarcity of refined petroleum products in our country must be treated as a national emergency. A stitch in time might still save nine!At the root of the current pain being faced by millions of Nigerians all over the country is the monstrously defective policy of nearly one hundred percent importation of refined petroleum products. Nigeria is about the only OPEC country trapped in the quagmire of complete dependence on foreign refineries for products it has capacity to produce locally. This is a most unfortunate commentary on our sovereignty.\u201d\n\nNLC lamented that the persisting scarcity of refined petroleum products has unleashed a tsunami of very dire economic realities including exorbitant airfare, cancellation of scheduled flights, destruction of thousands of automobile engines by adulterated fuel and wastage of productive hours.\n\n\u201cAs clearly captured in the Nigerian Workers\u2019 Charter of Demands, the only way out of this energy impasse is for the Federal Government to take very seriously the local refining of petroleum in Nigeria. We had severally identified the complete rehabilitation of our public refineries and the building of new refineries, both public and private, including modular refineries as the only sustainable panacea out of this national embarrassment and vulnerability in the security of our energy sector.\n\n\u201cWith the current surge in the price of crude oil, we urge the Federal Government to make judicious use of the bumper harvest of petro-dollars to fix our oil refineries. We must re-think Nigeria\u2019s hydrocarbon as a strategic asset for sustainable wealth creation and development.\n\n\u201cWe must now ditch the over-laboured gospel of deregulation which has been proved to be mere moniker for incessant increase in the price of petrol. The fact that NNPC cannot keep to its promise of 24-hour supply of petrol in advertised gas stations shows that the petrol importation policy has failed completely. Despite the claims that Diesel and Aviation fuel had been deregulated based on the import model, the products are still scarce and expensive proving that deregulation is not the answer to the crisis in our downstream oil sub-sector. Now is the time to go back to the basics. Fix our local Refineries! Build new Refineries!! Local Refining is the answer\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Labour Congress wishes to reiterate its position as contained in the Nigerian Workers\u2019 Charter of Demands that the government must adopt the policy of local refining and thus must rehabilitate our refineries. The Nigeria Labour Congress and Nigerian workers are in solidarity with the Nigerian people all over the country who have been made to bear the brunt of a crisis that is not their making rather consequent on poor policy choices of successive governments and which has been compounded by inefficient and incompetent management of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector.\u201d",

We have never had a time in our history when it is clear that it is our party, the PDP, that is truly the party of the young people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is why I ask you all to be excited about the journey ahead. This is because, by God\u2019s grace, PDP will be at the helm of the nation\u2019s affairs in 2023. However, it is clear that we cannot win without the strength, network, and influence of the young people in this room.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have had the opportunity to meet with members of the National Working Committee \u2014 and we are all on the same page that a PDP federal government must be a government that works functionally. Therefore, the only way we can be functional is to ensure that young people and women are fully integrated at the onset in all our strategies.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have shown that we are not just a party that talks. We are a party that does the work. I strongly believe that any government that comes in has to be a government that has the energy to do the work, and it is only young people that have the energy that we need,\u201d the former President of the Senate said.\n\n\n\nSaraki reminded the youth leaders that as it stands, there are currently over 18 million Nigerian young people who are not yet registered to vote.\n\n\u201cWe need you all to go out there and give these young people a reason to register to vote. You need to start mobilising at the ward, state, and zonal levels.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd of course, it goes without saying, at this time, young people should not only come out to vote, they should also come out and vie for elective positions. With the new Electoral Act, it is clear that we will have freer and fairer elections \u2014 and only young people can and will win,\u201d Saraki said.\n\n\n\nThe former Kwara State Governor, who was also the Chairman of the PDP National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee (NRSC), also spoke about how the NRSC had recommended waivers in the payment of nomination fees for aspirants under 35-years old that were seeking elective office.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*With 21-day notice required, meeting to replace chairman before convention out of time\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) escalated yesterday with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rejecting a letter inviting it to the emergency National Executive Committee meeting of the party scheduled for March 17 in Abuja where Governor Abubakar Sani Bello\u2019s appointment as caretaker chairman and other vital changes in the party are scheduled for ratification.\n\n\n\nINEC said the letter was not signed by the ousted National Chairman and National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and John Akpanudoedehe, respectively, thus, truncating the planned NEC meeting, and ultimately, a threat to the National Convention scheduled for March 26.\n\n\n\nBy implication, Sani Bello\u2019s leadership of APC is not known to INEC.\n\nAs a result, sources said some concerned stakeholders of the party reached out to President Muhammadu Buhari, who ordered Buni\u2019s removal, to forgive and allow him return as caretaker chairman, so that the March 26 National Convention date would be actualised, and save the party from ruin.\n\nAnother source told THISDAY that Buni would be heading to London tomorrow to meet with the President \u201cand sort out all issues about his return as Chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith the 21-day notice required for NEC meeting, in which changes to the leadership of a party will be effected, the planned emergency NEC meeting of the Sani Bello team is effectively out of time. The National Convention would have taken place and new National Working Committee members in place.\n\nFollowing the ouster of Buni, as the CECPC chairman last Tuesday and the appointment of Sani Bello, the Niger State Governor (upon resumption) transmitted a letter dated 8th March, 2022, informing INEC about the planned emergency NEC meeting.\n\n\n\nSani Bello introduced himself in the letter as acting Chairman while Professor Tahir Mamman was introduced as the acting Secretary of the party.\n\nBello and Professor Mamman were said to have signed the letter notifying the Commission about CECPC decision to hold the emergency NEC meeting and invited INEC to come and monitor it.\n\nBut the Commission, in a reply addressed to the \u201cAPC CECPC Chairman\u201d dated March 9, 2022, drew the party\u2019s attention to some lacuna in the invitation letter.\n\nINEC said the letter of invitation did not carry the signature of Buni and Akpanudoedehe, whom by implication, the Commission is saying, remains the officers of the party known to it.\n\n\n\nThe INEC letter titled, \u201cRe: Invitation to the Emergency Meeting of the National Executive Committee\u201d, dated March 9, 2022, was signed by the Secretary to the Commission, Mrs Rose Omoa Oriaran-Anthony.\n\nIt reads: \u201cPlease refer to your letter Ref.APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/022/32, dated 8th March 2022. The Commission draws your attention to the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2018).\n\n\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the APC is reminded of the provision in Section 82 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022, which requires \u2018at least 21 days\u2019 notice of any convention, congress, conference, or meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective office.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile hoping these issues are noted for compliance, please accept the assurance of the Commission\u2019s warm regards.\u201d\n\nBy implication, the stipulated 21-day notice to INEC for the commission to monitor the planned emergency NEC meeting had not been complied with.\n\nFor INEC to monitor the emergency NEC meeting, the APC letter notifying it ought to have been written earlier than March 8.\n\n\n\nOne of the stakeholders pushing for Buni\u2019s return told THISDAY last night that \u201ctwo weeks is not too much to give Buni, so that the mess he created can be cleared by him. This is our best option, otherwise, the party will crumble.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no point keeping Sani Bello as caretaker Committee Chairman. It is obviously illegal and INEC has clearly stated this. We are hopeful about getting a positive result from the President.\u201d\n\nThe source further confirmed that Buni, who is in Dubai on medicals, would return to Abuja tomorrow and most likely resume as caretaker chairman on Monday.\n\nSani Bello Denies Buni\u2019s Letter\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bello has denied knowledge of a letter purportedly written by Buni, asking him to take control of APC\u2019s affairs, while he proceeds to Dubai for medicals.\n\nThe letter dated February 28, requesting a leave of absence, signed by Buni and addressed to Bello, copying the CECPC members and INEC, surfaced last Thursday.\n\nBut while fielding questions from journalists after the APC\u2019s CECPC meeting late on Thursday, the Niger governor denied knowledge of the letter.\n\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d he said.\n\nSani Bello added that he had been in charge of the committee \u201cfor a while.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, INEC denied receiving Buni\u2019s letter, saying it would have responded if it was in receipt of any letter written to indicate that Buni actually handed over the leadership of the party to Bello.\n\nINEC National Commissioner of Voter Education and Publicity, Mr. Festus Okoye said: \u201cThe Commission has formal ways of communicating with political parties. The Commission is a public trust and any political party or individual that is interested in any communication by the Commission or to the Commission can apply for a Certified True Copy (CTC) of the document.\n\n\u201cIf the Commission is in receipt of such a document it will issue a CTC and will also respond if such a communication does not exist.\u201d\n\n\u2018APC Not Going Back on National Convention\u2019\n\nDespite the threats from INEC, the APC National Youth Leader and acting spokesperson, Ismael Ahmed said yesterday that the party would not change the date of its National Convention planned for March 26.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m not only a youth leader or internal spokesperson, I\u2019m also a lawyer and we have served a notice to INEC for the 26th of February earlier. We served that notice on February 5 and that covered the required 21 days.\u201d\n\nAhmed added that while Buni remained substantive Caretaker Chairman, Sani Bello was only acting.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020 whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of the acting Chairman. It has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd now the chairman wrote a letter and transmitted, for his leave to go for medical treatment. These are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency that cannot wait for convention. We have a convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy. So, one has to leave for another. The Chairman left, transmitted a letter, Governor Bello has been acting appropriately. What is the problem? Why is it difficult for people to simply understand that? \u201c\n\nHe stated that Bello was acting with the full authority of the caretaker committee, stakeholders, leaders of the party, and with the full consent of Buni.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear and very simple. If anybody has any issues with any of our decisions, you can take it to court. For now we\u2019re doing it with the full authority and backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity in this. Absolutely none,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nPDP: APC Lacks Legitimacy to Participate in 2023 Elections\n\nThe main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said the non-recognition of the activities of the APC by INEC further confirms its position that the APC lacks the legitimacy and statutory requisites to participate in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe PDP stated that INEC\u2019s decision further authenticates its stand that \u201cthe APC is a Special Purpose Vehicle in liquidation, preparatory to winding up; that cannot legally produce candidates for the elections.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThis decision by INEC is, therefore, another unmistaken \u2018red flag\u2019 to intending aspirants on the platform of the APC in the 2023 general elections that the APC has become defunct and cannot validly, legally and constitutionally field candidates in the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe new Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Mohood Olalekan Balogun Alliwo, Alli Okunmade II, who was installed as the 42nd monarch on the revered tool yesterday at the historic Mapo Hall, has pledged not to let Ibadan down during his reign.\n\n\n\nThe monarch, who was presented with his staff of office by Governor Seyi Makinde, amid singing and drumming at a well-attended ceremony, thanked the people of Ibadan for supporting him to ascend the throne after 36 years as the Mogaji of Ali Iwo.\n\n\n\nShortly before the presentation of the staff of office, former Governor Rashidi Ladoja, who is the Osi Olubadan, led other high chiefs to pay homage to the new monarch.\n\n\n\nThey all took turns to prostrate before the king.\n\nAlso, Moshood Ayanyemi, Atookowagbowo led other Ibadan drummers to welcome the guests and well-wishers to the occasion in a traditional way.\n\n\n\nVice President Osinbajo, who spoke on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, congratulated the new monarch and the people of Ibadanland and said with the amiable credentials, experience and exposure of the new Olubadan, \u201cthere is no doubt about his ability to discharge his responsibilities in collaboration with other constituted authorities to make Oyo State and Nigeria at large better.\u201d\n\n\n\nOsinbajo, who traced the political history of the ancient city, extolled the virtues of Ibadan as a city of many firsts, disclosing that whoever is to ascend the throne of the Olubadan must climb 23 chieftaincy steps, a feat which makes the Olubadan succession plan unique in the whole of Yorubaland.\n\n\n\nMakinde, in his speech, declared that the event was a victory for Ibadanland and a restoration of the dignity of its exemplary traditional chieftaincy system.\n\n\n\nHe congratulated the new Olubadan, whom he described as a man of many parts, expressing the confidence that Ibadan would grow in leaps and bounds under his reign while charging the Olubadan-in-Council to, as custodians of the cultures and ethos of Ibadanland, protect the sanctity of its chieftaincy system and not allow politicians interfere with it.\n\n\n\nAccording to the governor, the Ibadan traditional system is a time-tested and long-lasting chieftaincy system that has remained a worthy example in chieftaincy succession across the globe.\n\n\n\nHe also urged the new Olubadan to remain steadfast as the gatekeeper of Ibadan traditional system, adding that if at any point an amendment becomes necessary to the traditional system, such should be self-proposed by the Olubadan-in-Council and not be left to the whims of politicians.\n\n\n\nMakinde said: \u201cI want to restate that even though we politicians will come and go, sometimes, to satisfy our political whims, we may make decisions that do not protect our traditional systems.\n\n\u201cThis is why the custodians of our culture must always take a stand against us tinkering with age-old traditional systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur elders, the members of the various councils, the chiefs, our traditional fathers, they are the gatekeepers and they must remain steadfast in their roles. Remember, no politician can destroy any system without the cooperation of some members of these systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, I want to use this opportunity to ask that Kabiyesi and the Olubadan-in-Council work to ensure that the laws having to do with the ascension to the throne of Olubadan remain sacrosanct.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Olubadan-in-Council should remain self-regulated without any external interference from the political class.\n\n\u201cWe rejoice with the sons and daughters of Ibadanland, both at home and in the diaspora. The massive crowd gathered here today, speaks to the importance of this occasion.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor maintained that the new monarch has distinguished himself as an excellent professional and has contributed and would continue to contribute to the development of Ibadanland and Oyo State at large, having served both in private and public service.\n\n\n\nHe added that he was assured that Oba Balogun was in a good position to defend the sanctity and tradition of Ibadan people and move Ibadanland forward.\n\n\n\nThe governor wished His Imperial Majesty, a long, peaceful and successful reign, praying that the land of Ibadan will experience unequalled development and tranquility during Kabiyesi\u2019s reign.\n\nProminent Nigerians, especially sons and daughters of Ibadanland; politicians, captains of industries, and a flock of tourists and stakeholders \u2013 home and abroad, graced the occasion.\n\n\n\nAside Osinbajo, other dignitaries were former Vice-President Abubakar and governors of Ekiti, Ogun and Kano, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Prince Dapo Abiodun, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, respectively.\n\n\n\nAmong the traditional rulers in attendance were the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi; Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III; Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Abubakar Sa\u2019ad; Emir of Kano, His Eminence, Alhaji Ado Bayero and the Etsu Nupe, Dr. Yahaya Abubakar.\n\n\n\nMajor roads in Ibadan were closed while markets were shut in honour of Oba Balogun while the installation lasted.\n\nMany associations, in different colorful outfits, were seen within and outside the Mapo Hall premises \u2014 venue of the event, dancing to the indigenous Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 music of Ibadanland.\n\n\n\nThe 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland was ushered into the venue at exactly 11.50am, after which all the traditional chiefs, Mogajis, religious leaders, leaders of various associations in Ibadanland paid homage to Oba Balogun.\n\nOba Balogun, who is from Ali Iwo Family, became the Mogaji of his family in 1986 and the death of Oba Saliu Adetunji on January 2, 2022 paved the way for his emergence as the new Olubadan.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "US to Partner Nigeria to Stop Gas Flaring By Conversion to Ammonia",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s energy transition agenda, in line with global direction received a boost on Thursday at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, Texas, as the United States\u2019 Government indicated interest in a bi-lateral partnership that would see the conversion of the enormous gas resources currently being flared to ammonia.\n\n\n\nAmmonia has the potential of being a huge revenue earner for the country especially as the European Union, in pursuit of the net zero-emission programme, has unveiled its long-anticipated plans to make importers and non-EU manufacturers pay for the carbon emissions associated with the goods and materials they sell in the EU, thus impacting on vessels powered by fossils fuels entering EU territory.\n\n\n\nSince running such vessels during that tax regime will not be economically viable, there is the need to redesign engines of such vessels; and attention is already being focused on ammonia as an alternative fuel source, to replace heating oil and other fossil fuels. The resort to ammonia is because it is not just cleaner, but a cheaper source of energy.\n\n\n\nInvariably, it means there would no longer be an easy and attractive market for heating oil, one of the most highly sought-after products in the configuration of Nigeria\u2019s refineries. The adoption of the Carbon Border Tax by the EU has the potential of hurting the Nigerian economy which is largely serviced with proceeds from its hydrocarbon potentials. This would compound the challenge already posed by the vigorous pursuit of the zero-emission plan by the developed countries, due to the reduced earnings from Nigeria\u2019s refinery configured products such as heating oil (i.e. LPFO, HPFO).\n\n\n\nThe Paris Agreement and the United Nation\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to limit the development of oil and gas projects in the pursuit of more environment friendly energy options \u2013 from fossil fuels to green and renewable energy \u2013 in the next two decades. This poses enough threat to the country\u2019s major revenue stream, which is why sustaining current revenue drivers and considering other viable options became the major thrust of discussions by Nigeria at the conference.\n\n\n\nThe energy transition agenda therefore became the centre of focus for the Nigerian delegation, led by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Silva and which included the Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Engr. Gbenga Komolafe and the Board Secretary and Legal Adviser to the NUPRC, Barrister Olayemi Anyanechi. The team continued to drive conversations around energy transition in a multi-track approach at the various meetings held with top officials of the global energy circuit.\n\n\n\nIt argued that instead of a complete abandonment of further development of hydro-carbon infrastructure and phasing out fossil fuel use within the stipulated period, a multi-track approach where gas would be adopted as transition energy source would be fair and just to be pursued, as that was more practicable and sustainable, particularly in respect of developing countries.\n\n\n\nSilva explained that Nigeria already has a transition plan which is predicated on a multi-track approach to developing energy resources. One of those is a focused development of the country\u2019s gas resources during which period a diversified economy would be built around technology and other energy sources. That, he stressed, would help a great deal in boosting the country\u2019s revenue levels and sustaining its economy.\n\n\n\nDiscussions on the subject were taken from different perspectives, including zeroing-in on gas potentials and the implication of continued gas flaring and reinjection. The effect of flaring on the environment and health of the people of oil-bearing communities was specifically highlighted as the team explored concrete ways of ending the menace.\n\n\n\nThe point of convergence is the responsible monetization of Nigerian\u2019s gas resources which the American counterparts were in agreement. The US team appreciated the multifaceted approach to curtail emissions proposed by the Nigerian government and made suggestions on innovative ways to develop stranded gas resources in a more responsible manner, some of which include the use of Blue Hydrogen which is obtained when natural gas is split into hydrogen and CO2 either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or Auto Thermal Reforming (ATR). However, the CO2 is captured and stored, which in return mitigates the harsh impact on the environment.\n\nThis the US team suggested would be a good way for Nigeria to utilize its abundant Natural gas resources of over 200 trillion cubic feet (TCF).\n\n\n\nDuring one of the several meetings which involved the US Secretary of State for Energy, Jennifer M. Granholm, and a second which involved Honourable Harry Kamian, Assistant Secretary of State for the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Energy Resources, the United States Government showed interest in collaborating with the Nigerian government to develop the country\u2019s gas resources, recognising that Africa may indeed need to be given separate recognition, as long as development of natural gas hastens the net-zero emissions target of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the world at large.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. DOE promised to support Nigeria with development partners to put through the framework for the development of its gas resources\n\nRiding on the optimism of the meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State for Energy, the the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) team met with Brendan Kelly of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Puneet Sharma of CyanNH3 to discuss extensive methane abatement opportunities in Nigeria, in partnership with the United States government, especially in the area of conversion of gas to ammonia, for use either as fertiliser or for export.\n\n\n\nThe team highlighted the fact that the proposed EU Carbon Border Tax would put severe financial pressure on the use of LPFO and HPFO by vessels and provide a renewed impetus for producers around the world to accelerate efforts to slash their carbon footprints, thus creating a massive opportunity for the use of ammonia as the fuel of choice.\n\n\n\nIn response, the US team promised to collaborate with the Nigerian government by funding a study to evaluate the viability of making Nigeria an Ammonia net export nation from the 218 flare sites which flare an average of 0.7 Billion cubic feet (BCF) of gas daily, with skid mounted innovative ammonia production equipment\u2019s and other virtual pipeline development devices.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the US Department of State and Department of Trade agreed to collaborate with Nigeria by working together with development partners to fund a study to mature these initiatives into full gas commercialization and convert the waste into a source of federation revenue generation, while eliminating the environmental degradation.\n\nFinally, the successful take off of the project will not only open another massive revenue stream for the country but would tackle the challenges of environmental pollution and the resultant health challenges visited on the people of oil producing communities, as a result of gas flaring. In essence, the success of ongoing discussions with the U.S. government and proposed development partners will not only arrest environmental degradation and guarantee the health of the people, it also has the potential to generate much needed foreign exchange for the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says power sector subsidy removal quietly done\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe federal government disclosed Friday that it had quietly removed all subsidies in the power sector, even as it plans to gradually stop similar subsidies on petroleum motor spirit (PMS), popularly known as fuel. The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who made the disclosure during a virtual meeting of African finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said: \u201cWe are cleaning up our subsidies. We had a setback, we were to remove fuel subsidy by July this year but there was a lot of push back from the polity. We have elections coming and also because of the hardship that companies and citizens went through during the COVID-19 pandemic, we just felt that the time was not right, so we pulled back on that.\u201cBut we have been able to quietly implement subsidy removal in the electricity sector and as it is, as we speak, we don\u2019t have subsidies in the electricity sector. We did that overtime by carefully adjusting the prices at some levels while holding the lower levels down.\u201dSpeaking further during the meeting with the theme: \u201cThe Political Economy of Fiscal Reforms in Africa,\u201d Ahmed noted that the current high price of crude oil had further increased petrol subsidy burden on the federal government.According to her, although the government had a setback in its plan to have subsidies on petrol removed by July this year, it would work with the National Assembly to have it removed in phases.\u201cFuel subsidy is a huge problem for us. It has thrown up our deficits too much higher than we planned. What is happening now with the global oil prices is also going to worsen matters but the current review that we are doing is to hold the subsidy at the level in which we planned.\u201cWe are currently doing a budget amendment to accommodate incremental subsidy (removal) as a result of the reversal of the decision and we want to cap it at that. \u201cHopefully, the parliament will agree with us and we are able to continue with our plan for subsidy (removal) otherwise the way things are going we will not be able to predict where we will be,\u201d she said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian government shuts down 6 illegal digital loan companies",
          "text": "On Friday, 3 Nigerian federal government agencies\u2014Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related Offences Commission (ICPC)\u2014collaborated with the Nigerian police force to raid some illegal financial institutions operating from their Opebi Road offices in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Punch, digital lending platforms like GoCash, Okash, EasyCredit, Easi Moni, KashKash, and Speedy Choice were among the busted companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe FCCPC, which led the joint operation, said the raid was a response to several customers\u2019 complaints about the malpractices carried out by financial institutions.\n\nSpeaking at the raid, the CEO at FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said the agency started investigating and monitoring these companies in 2020 when consumers started accusing them of mishandling and violating their private data in the process of loan recovery.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. When the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise of money lenders,\u201d Irukera said. \u201cBecause of the lockdown, people needed small and instant loans to sustain, which is understandable. But, over a period of time, people started to complain about the malpractice of the lenders so we started tracking it.\u201d\n\nIrukera also mentioned that, towards the end of last year, the agency had gathered a lot of information and started working with some other key agencies to monitor these businesses.\n\nAccording to Irukera, their findings so far are: the interest rate charged by these digital lenders appears to violate the ethics of how lending is done; secondly, the unethical loan recovery practice of violating customers\u2019 privacy to abuse and shame them and their acquaintances.\n\n\u201cSo, we started an investigation trying to determine the location of these firms, which has been very difficult. These companies move around a lot, and it took us several months visiting each of their locations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FCCPC boss, however, said investigations also revealed that the loan firms weren\u2019t Nigerian nor registered in the country, they don\u2019t have an address nor do they have a licence to do business in Nigeria. He also said that most of these companies operated from the same place and by the same person.\n\nWith no address, all these companies have are mobile apps that can be downloaded on both Google and Apple Stores. So the agency had to engage the people who have been their victims and gather more evidence.\n\nBy now, all the agencies involved had gotten enough information and evidence to convince the court to issue a warrant for them to proceed with an investigation into a search and seizure.\n\n\u201cAnd sometime last month, a court issued a warrant and between then and now, we were preparing a sting operation, which is what you are seeing here today. The reason for this is because we wanted to be sure we were hitting at the place where we could get many of them,\u201d said the FCCPC boss.\n\nHe also mentioned that the agency had issued an order to Apple and Google to take down these companies\u2019 apps from their platforms. It has also ordered the banks to freeze these companies\u2019 bank accounts.\n\nLast year, when NITDA sanctioned Sokoloan, TechCabal reported that that would be the first of many. Though it took longer than expected, it\u2019s finally happening.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t also mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones\u2014no. We want to start with them. We also understand that there are between 5 and 7 companies operating at the same location,\u201d said Irukera, hinting at the agency\u2019s ambition to cleanse the nation of all illegal digital lending practices.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peace Ojemeh\u2019s Haze Monkey finds a home in the $80 billion NFT industry",
          "text": "\u201cHoly f*ck.\u201d\n\nThat was what Beeple tweeted when \u201cEverydays: The First 5,000 Days\u201d, his non-fungible Token (NFT) art and the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house, was bought for $69 million at Christie\u2019s in March last year. This event didn\u2019t only make Beeple the third richest artist in the world, it ushered in the beginning of a new era for the art world.\n\nWhile Beeple\u2019s was the most expensive JPEG NFT format, profile-pic NFT (PPF)\u2014NFTs that depict a portrait that can be used as a social media avatar\u2014also hit some record-breaking milestones. For example, Crypto Punk NFTs that were given out for free in 2017 at launch started trading for prices between $480,000 and $1.25 million in January 2021 and, by the end of the year, they wouldn\u2019t go for anything less than $4 million.\n\nThough NFT has been around since 2014, 2021 was the pivotal year for this \u201cnovelty and strange\u201d technology. It was the year it broke into the mainstream, disrupting the art world and waltzing its way into the hearts of almost every aspect of pop culture, from music to film to sports and literature.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile all of this was happening, a crop of young and curious African minds have also started to develop an appetite and build an NFT ecosystem on the continent. Although it felt\u2014still feels\u2014like a myth to the broader population, more people had started buying into it. Jacon Osinachi was well on his way to becoming the foremost NFT artist on the continent and, arguably, the world. Anthony Azekwoh would soon create and sell his first NFT \u201cThe Red Man\u201d, one of the most popular NFT pieces out of Africa. Zimbabwean Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d, a digital art of late African-American entertainment and sports stars\u2014DMX, Kobe Bryant, Aaliyah, Chadwick Boseman, Tupac Shakur, and Nipsey Hussle\u2014would soon be picked up and displayed on a billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square.\n\nSomewhere in Abuja, Nigeria, is Peace Ojemeh 24, a Nigerian product designer and an Open Source advocate, who, like everybody else, is trying to understand the \u201cinsanity\u201d around this technology, the reason anybody would spend millions of dollars on something intangible\u2014something they might never touch physically.\n\nWhile Ojemeh was still making sense of this, the original copy of \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d, a viral photo meme of a girl smirking as a fire roared behind her, sold for $500,000 (180 ETH at the time).\n\n\u201cReading about Disaster girl, a meme I casually use in my WhatsApp chats with friends, selling for such a ridiculous amount of dollars, was an awakening. I just knew I had to get in on NFTs,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nBut judging from Ojemeh\u2019s journey, this could have been all talk. That wasn\u2019t the first time Ojemeh would get excited about crypto and its related ventures. In 2017 and 2018, she had planned to buy her first ethereum (ETH) but ended up not going through with it.\n\nWhen she finally did something in the space, it was a disaster. She bought edcoin, a crypto token from a Nigerian blockchain company Edmark. She even convinced her mother and uncle to invest in it but a few months after, while ETH ballooned into over $1,000, Edcoin started dropping in value.\n\nBy 2020, it was obvious edcoin wasn\u2019t going anywhere so she began to think of how to flip this seemingly bad investment into a lucrative one. She withdrew her investment from edcoin into ETH and then into e-gold and some other coins that yielded positives. This experience exposed her to the slippery world of crypto and the learnings from it shaped how she approaches crypto today.\n\nFounding Haze Monkey Society\n\nSo instead of going right into NFTs after the \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d news, Ojemeh decided to learn about the industry, and invested in some NFTs to have access to their communities to understand how they function and are being managed. By the time she gathered enough knowledge, she reached out to her friend Alabo Briggs, 22, a blockchain engineer, about building their own NFT collection. Briggs was on board with the idea but advised that they start small by first minting a single NFT then flying from there. But Ojemeh\u2019s ambition was bigger than that; she wanted to build a strong NFTs community like Crypto Punk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) had built, and she wanted to hit the ground running.\n\nSo, in August, while Pablo Stanley, a product designer and doodler, was launching Robotos, a 10,000-robot NFT collection, and selling out, Ojemeh and Briggs started building a collection of stoned monkeys they would call Haze Monkey Society.\n\nHaze Monkey Society was launched as a collection of 4,200 NFTs focused on building a no-code platform aimed at empowering NFT creators and artists and making an environmental impact in Africa.\n\n\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, we needed to associate ourselves with a successful project while not being a complete replica. So with the success of BAYC, we chose to identify as monkeys,\u201d said Ojemeh. \u201cHaze indicates the weed-smoking culture among creatives. It\u2019s also an inspiration behind our unique number: 420.\u201d\n\nHaze Monkey has unique and rich storytelling built into each of its NFTs.\n\nA thoughtful roadmap\n\nOne of the things that determines the success of an NFT project is its community. And what makes a community thrive is the utilities, the benefits, that come from holding such NFT. Ojemeh and Briggs know this, and that\u2019s why they spent a lot of time deliberating on their roadmap.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just sell NFTs, we are keen on finding a way to provide value to Haze Monkey\u2019s holders,\u201d said Ojemeh, who also consults for the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, and the African Union on a project that exposes technology as a career path to girls across African countries.\n\nBesides access to an exclusive social community, there are 3 major benefits on Haze Monkey\u2019s roadmap. One of them is the no-code platform which Ojemeh said was born out of creating an environment where people don\u2019t need deep tech knowledge to harness the blockchain technology.\n\nThe next one is the animation series about Haze Monkey\u2019s unique stories where holders and community members will be characters. Lastly, the duo, having been born and bred in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, where petroleum exploration in the area continues to pollute their water and atmosphere, decided to include something personal to them: they want to plant 100 trees somewhere in Africa for every single NFT minted.\n\nA learning curve that led to a new direction\n\nAbout 10 days before Haze Monkey NFTs would start its public minting in February, the team launched a countdown campaign and daily Twitter space discussion, where the community would come together, ask questions, calculate the societal impact of the project and, most importantly, the fortune it promises.\n\nThe minting calendar had been set; the public minting price was set at 0.08 ETH at a maximum of 4 NFTs per address and the presale price for those who had been whitelisted after performing some tasks or winning giveaways was pegged at 0.06 ETH at a maximum of 2 NFTs.\n\nIn one of those Twitter Spaces, a community member with a monkey avatar and a Mexican accent asked what would happen if the collection did not sell out within the opening week. For a few seconds, there was silence and one could tell he\u2019d ask an unexpected question. It was obvious the team hadn\u2019t considered this.\n\n\u201cWell, the plan is to sell out, but in a situation where we don\u2019t the community will decide what to do,\u201d answered Ashlei, one of the US-based community managers who was moderating the space.\n\nBefore the countdown campaign started, Haze Monkey had gathered over 5,000 organic social followers and over 6,000 Discord community members from across the globe. The project had also been listed and verified on 7 of the largest NFT platforms\u2014NFT Calendar, NFT Drop, NFT Evening, Coin Market Cap, Rarity, Next Drop, NFT Genie, and Rarity Sniper.\n\nWith this increasing traction at zero marketing budget, the possibility of not selling out was out of the question. But Haze Monkey did about 20%. Among other factors, this could be attributed to the recent scare of stolen NFTs issues on OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace in the world.\n\nHowever, the slow movement couldn\u2019t deter the team as they\u2019ve quickly started looking for new strategies. They are currently iterating their roadmap to suite the new reality and as a result, the community decided to reduce the amount of of Haze Monkey in circulation.\n\n\u201cAs a request from the community, our genesis collection was cut down to 1,242 with a vision of releasing the rest over time,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nShe also mentioned that the community had initially agreed to cap volume at 1, 000, but because of how significant 420 is to the project and its weed-cultured monkeys, the number 1,242 was chosen.\n\nHaze Monkey is now a collection of 1,242 NFTs.\n\nThough built by Africans in Africa, Haze Monkey has already positioned itself as a global brand. In its Discord group, the project has about 5 different channels for people who can\u2019t speak English.

          "text": "Over the past month, at least 2 of Nigeria\u2019s largest commercial banks have announced reduced limits on international transactions using naira debit cards to $20 (around \u20a610,000) per month.\n\nThis comes as a longstanding scarcity of foreign exchange continues to bite Africa\u2019s largest economy and biggest oil exporter, despite the recent surge in global energy prices.\n\nNigerians can use their naira-denominated debit cards to pay for transactions billed in US dollars online. For every purchase, debits are made directly from their naira accounts at current exchange rates.\n\nBefore now, customers could spend up to $100 (\u20a650,000) on web transactions using their naira cards but that limit has been cut by Zenith Bank PLC and United Bank for Africa (UBA), per emails sent to customers and seen by TechCabal\n\n\u201cThe monthly card international spend limit for web transactions has been reviewed from $100 to $20,\u201d Zenith said, adding that the review is \u201cin response to today\u2019s economic realities.\u201d\n\nThat statement came about two weeks after UBA told its customers the same in February, with the reviewed naira card limits for international transactions taking effect March 1.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe banks have also suspended the use of naira cards for international Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals and POS transactions, meaning cardholders cannot perform cash withdrawals and payments via those channels outside the country.\n\n\u201cIf you have higher International spend requirements, simply visit any of our branches and request for a foreign currency debit or prepaid card, which are available in US Dollar, Pounds, and Euro variants,\u201d Zenith Bank added.\n\n\u201cRemember you can use your UBA Dollar, Pounds or Euro Card for international POS, ATM, and web transactions,\u201d UBA\u2019s mail read. \u201cIf you do not have one and would like to subscribe, please visit a branch close to you.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nigerians have reacted with displeasure on social media against the new limits as they restrict their ability to pay for international transactions like Netflix subscriptions, ads on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.\n\n$20/month spending limit on @UBAGroup cards???

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRecently, my mental health has taken some heavy hits, and this week has been extremely stressful for me. Enough about me, though. What comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cmental health\u201d? A mad person?\n\nSide bar: It\u2019s encouraging to see how people are coming forward to test for mental illnesses and accept treatment. While this is still a long way off in Africa, it\u2019s certain we\u2019re getting there. So, thanks to the Internet for bringing it to light!\n\nBack to the matter. Is mental health only related to mental illnesses? Is it limited to schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, eating disorder, depression, insomnia, alcohol and substance abuse, and other similar conditions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s your answer: Mental health encompasses more than just mental illnesses. It is related to how a person feels, thinks, and acts.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes it as a state of well-being in which an individual recognises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community.\n\nThis means that someone may have good mental health, no mental illness or be somewhere in between. This refers to the mental health spectrum.\n\nFor instance, Ayo, a 27-year-old graduate, may not exhibit any signs of mental illness but is unemployed, with a negative attitude toward himself and his relationships, or may not have a strong sense of purpose. Can you say Ayo is mentally healthy? Of course not!\n\nHaving good mental health and no mental illness is at the top of the spectrum, while having poor mental health and a mental illness is at the bottom. While the people who are somewhere in the middle may have good mental health but a mental illness, they may also have poor mental health but no mental illness.\n\nConsequently, we must all strive to be at the top of the mental health spectrum which begins with prioritising your mental health as much as you do your physical and sexual health.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN) 1999 guarantees Nigerian citizens the fundamental right to privacy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that under Section 37 of the CFRN, citizens have the right to privacy in their homes, correspondence, phone conversations, and telegraphic communications.\n\nThe Constitution, however, does not define \u201cprivacy\u201d or contain detailed privacy provisions. So, it is unclear how far Nigerian codified law protects data privacy.\n\nBut, personal data is becoming increasingly valuable, and it is constantly sought after by nefarious individuals who intend to exploit it to the detriment of the data subjects.\n\nThe current state of our laws demonstrates the need for Nigeria to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for data protection, don\u2019t you think?\n\nThis, among other reasons, could be why the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the establishment of a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB), to focus on data protection and privacy in the country.\n\nOgheneruemu, a non-practising lawyer and Techpoint Africa Reporter, provided us with additional information about this new data protection enforcing body. What effect will this new agency have on your privacy rights?\n\nCheck it out here: Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntler East Africa, a venture capital firm based in Nairobi, has closed a $13.5 million fund to invest in early-stage tech startups in an oversubscribed round.\n\nInitially, the VC intended to raise $10 million but ended up with $13.5 million. Do the math: they received an additional $3.5 million.\n\nThe round\u2019s limited partners include Baillie Gifford, Canica, and other institutional investors like the International Finance Corporation.\n\nAntler East Africa launched in August 2019, two years after Antler \u2013 its parent company \u2013 was founded by Magnus Grimeland. Every year, the VC firm employs a full venture building model with two cohorts.\n\nThe company uses a hybrid model acting as both a venture builder and a venture capital firm. From its $300 million fund, the firm has invested in over 250 companies ranging from pre-seed to Series C.\n\nSo far, five cohorts of 153 founders have graduated from the accelerator programs, and the firm has made 14 investments. AIfluence, Marketforce-subsidiary Digiduka, Honeycoin, Uncover Skincare, Try Cooked, and Vybe are some examples.\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s new fund will allow it to invest in founders who want to build their startups from the ground up and already formed teams that require capital to scale.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nUnderstanding others\u2019 feelings: what is empathy and why do we need it?.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB)\n\nThe statement was signed by Uwa Suleiman, Media Aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, the NDPB was established in line with global best practices and would focus on data protection and privacy for the country.\n\nAmong other things, the statement credits the introduction of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) with creating more awareness about data protection and resulting in the \u201cdatafication\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we are not sure of the specifics of the agency\u2019s duties, Suleiman says the NDPB will consolidate the gains of the NDPR and support the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\n\nFor now, we can say with certainty that Vincent Olatunji will head the NDPB as National Commissioner/CEO.\n\nOlatunji served as the Acting DG of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) until October 2016 before handing over to Pantami, nine months after his appointment.\n\nDoes Nigeria have a new Data Protection Authority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this is no.\n\nThe long answer, which requires some explaining, is maybe.\n\nWhen NITDA introduced the NDPR, the agency handed itself some oversight functions, effectively becoming Nigeria\u2019s default Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nBut what are DPAs? According to the European Commission, \u201cDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise, through investigative and corrective powers, the application of the data protection law. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against violations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the relevant national laws.\u201d\n\nSo think of a DPA as a bodyguard to ensure your data rights are protected, and companies don\u2019t get away with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, this would apply to the NDPR\n\nHowever, unlike Europe and other countries \u2014 including some countries in Africa \u2014 NITDA did not create a separate entity to act as a DPA. A scenario that some have argued goes beyond the powers assigned in the NITDA Act.\n\nEssentially, one could argue that NITDA appointing itself DPA is unlawful or, in legal terms, void.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers the Agency to \u201cdevelop guidelines for electronic governance and monitor the use of electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic communication transactions as an alternative to paper-based methods in government, commerce, education, the private and public sectors, labour, and other fields, where the use of electronic communication may improve the exchange of data and information.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the NITDA Act does not appear to give the Agency the power to issue the NDPR in itself. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nGoing by this new development, though, it appears that four years into the NDPR\u2019s regime, we might be getting a DPA in the true sense of the word. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though, because there\u2019s still the pesky problem of an establishing law.\n\nIn most countries, DPAs are created through a governing law or regulation. A presidential approval does not a DPA make, but this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, for which we are cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor now, however, our earlier answers are still valid. Until NITDA or the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy confirms whether the NDPB is a DPA, we can only speculate.\n\nOlumide Babalola, Managing Partner at Olumide Babalola LP, believes that \u201cThe statement is silent on what form the Bureau would take. It reportedly currently shares an office with the National Information Technology Development Agency (\u2018NITDA\u2019).\n\n\u201cHence, as things stand, the Bureau is no more than a department under NITDA as it currently has no separate identity, not even a website where information on its operations can be accessed.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the Data Protection Bill?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman\u2019s statement, the NDPB would \u201csupport the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe race to a dedicated data protection and privacy law has taken several turns. Filled with false starts, the closest Nigeria has come to a law passed by the National Assembly was in 2018 with the Nigeria Data Protection Bill 2018. Although both houses passed it in 2019, President Buhari withheld his assent.\n\nThe most successful attempt remains the NDPR, a guideline at best.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill 2020 (PDF) is currently before the National Assembly, but nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nThe Bill provides a much more robust approach to data protection, providing for more categories of data than the NDPR, which appears to deal more with electronic data. It also creates a Data Protection Commission, which should act as Nigeria\u2019s DPA.\n\nInterestingly, there are rumours that the Bill has been abandoned, and the federal government is seeking a consultant to draft a new one.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBusiness as usual for now.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding the NDPR and NITDA\u2019s power to appoint itself DPA are still dark areas, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now.\n\nThe introduction of the NDPB raises a little wave of dust over Nigeria\u2019s data protection and privacy crate. It raises questions that cannot be adequately answered until we see appropriate legislation or more guidelines and perhaps a \u201cdedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhat follows should make for interesting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

I did, but I saw a recap and the best way to describe my reaction is mind blown \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe event had some boring announcements, like the new iPhone colours and the underwhelmingly designed iPhone SE. To be fair, the SE comes with an impressive spec upgrade, but the design is a total replica of the 2020 SE.\n\nMy guess is that Apple wants you to buy their more high-end products rather than their budget (a $430 phone is not a budget phone ) products. So if you cannot afford the flagships, you should be able to buy the SE. Keyword being should.\n\nThe mind-blowing part of the event for me was when the Mac Studio was announced. A machine the size of a bowl of nkwobi, but with beastly specs. It runs on Apple\u2019s new chip \u2014 M1 Ultra \u2014 eight times faster than last year\u2019s M1 Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a 20 core CPU, up to 8 terabytes of solid-state drive (SSD), and 128 gigabytes of unified memory or RAM. While the specs sound incredible, how it handles third-party software will decide its power.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe creation of Ozi with no-code tools\n\nOkHi\u2019s $1.5m raise\n\n$1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\nBuilding a startup with no-code tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross section of Ozi team. L-R: Israel Akpan, Co-founder and COO; Azeez Adejumo, Co-founder and CEO; Olukayaode Amusu, CMO. Source: Supplied.\n\nTwo University of Lagos (UNILAG) graduates \u2014 Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan \u2014 are building a tech startup without writing one line of code.\n\nHow did it begin? After spending months looking for a developer to build their product, the duo resorted to no-code tools. They found exciting products that didn\u2019t require any coding expertise. But even a startup built with no-code tools still has challenges.\n\nTheir startup, Ozi, can be described as a Communications as a Service product that Azeez and Akpan started in the university. But as their clientele grew in number and quality, privacy concerns they didn\u2019t consider rose, and they lost a considerable amount of clients.\n\nOzi provides chatbots and helps send bulk messages on WhatsApp. Although other platforms like SMS and email can be leveraged, the startup is doubling down on WhatsApp for several reasons. One of them is open rates.\n\nThe startup has recently closed a $10,000 angel round and has increased its user-base from 100 to 10,000\n\nOne thing I find interesting about Ozi is the different iterations and the challenges the founders have gone through in putting a startup together with no-code tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a startup idea and have zero coding skills, you should read Ogheneruemu\u2019s conversation with Azeez and Akpan: How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi\n\nSmart addressing with OkHi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can find your home address easily on Google Maps, you are one of the very few Africans with a verifiable address. Getting packages delivered to your doorsteps would be hassle-free \u2014 for the most part.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me and your house doesn\u2019t even have a number, then we\u2019re among the 400 million Africans who do not have verifiable addresses. This makes getting deliveries or even opening bank accounts hard.\n\nInterestingly, OkHi, a smart-addressing startup, wants to solve this problem. The startup was built by Timbo Drayson when he noticed Google Maps doesn\u2019t work perfectly in Africa. In 2014, he launched the address verification startup in Kenya, verifying over 300,000 addresses so far.\n\nOkHi expanded into Nigeria after a $1.5 million seed and a partnership with Interswitch. Yesterday, it also announced another $1.5 million seed extension from investors, including Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola and Interswitch.\n\nOkHi had a conversation with Chimgozorim, and they discussed how the startup is providing address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups.

The fintech startup isn\u2019t just offering financial services to the digitally savvy but to every African without an Internet connection.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Yep!\u2019s Co-founder, Olaoluwa Awojoodu, said, \u201cWe want to bank the guys in Lagos as well as bank the guys in a village at Ikot Ekpene.\u201d\n\nHow? Yep! isn\u2019t Awojoodu\u2019s first rodeo in the finance world. He is the Founder of E-Settlement, a holding company for different financial entities; its agent banking platform, PayCentre Africa, has over 5 million customers.\n\nYep! will leverage this massive customer base to bring the underbanked among them into the \u201cdigital fold.\u201d\n\nExplaining, Awojoodu said, \u201cnot just the guys that are digitally enabled, but even the guys that are off the digital channels, we are going to bring everybody into the digital environment using both digital tools and agent networks.\u201d\n\nYep! has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed in a round led by Greenhouse Capital. While other fintechs, for example, OPay, have a similar model, its competitive advantage lies in how easily it can provide credit facilities for its agents.\n\nThe pre-seed fund will go into doubling its agent network to over 200,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhat Happens When a Child Gets COVID?

          "title": "I started as a receptionist \u2013 Zain Asher, CNN anchor",
          "text": "Zain Asher is a business and personal finance correspondent for CNN, where she appears across platforms covering the latest news on money and the economy. In this interview with IFEOMA OKEKE-KORIEOCHA, she advised women on how they can excel in journalism. She also spoke on how she built a successful career for herself. Excerpts:\n\nCould you please, tell us how your journey in journalism has been and how you have excelled in your career?\n\nI haven\u2019t always excelled to be honest and really want young people in Nigeria to understand that success is not a straight line. There are always bumps along the way. There are always roadblocks and traffic lights on the way. I started off as a receptionist. That was my first job out of university. I was a receptionist for almost four years.\n\nI am not saying there is anything wrong with being a receptionist but I did not want to remain a receptionist. I wanted to move up within this production company but that never happened, no matter how many times I asked for promotion, it never happened. If you are not meant to be doing a job, it is better that you find out sooner than later so that you can make the appropriate changes.\n\nSo, when I realised the job was not for me and the promotion was never going to happen, I sat down and asked myself what I wanted to do and what I really loved and that for me was journalism. I studied journalism in Grad school. It was hard for me to get a job when I graduated. So, I decided to try my luck with this production company. When that did not work, I went back to journalism. And I really worked hard.\n\nI am a resourceful person. When I resigned, I got my roommate at the time to film me with a camera around California, basically pretending to be a reporter. I put together packages and visual stories, hoping that I could send it to a TV station and they would hire me. I didn\u2019t have much experience then though but I had studied enough for what it took to put together an honest story and I could do it. So, I sent this to a station in the New York area. They agreed to bring me on an interview. I went to New York, did the interview and even when I didn\u2019t have any experience, they were impressed that I had the tenacity and the drive to put together this tape myself, teach myself how to put together those stories and how to do stand-ups. So, they gave me a job on the spot.\n\nRead also: \u2018Why housing schemes crash in Nigeria\u2019\n\nThere are so many lessons in that for young people because I could have easily told myself that I didn\u2019t have any experience, so it would be difficult to get a job at the station. But you don\u2019t know unless you try. So my message is for people to just try.\n\nAnother piece of advice in journalism is, \u2018Have a specialty.\u2019 Find something that you can offer that few people can also offer. I got my start from Business Journalism. I studied Business news. I largely taught myself and that really helped me because I had something to offer besides just being a general assignment reporter.\n\nThere is this perception that journalism takes a lot of time, as people consistently have to break stories and stay on them. So, it\u2019s difficult for a married woman to thrive in this field. What is your take on this?\n\nIn Nigeria I have heard a lot of stories among female journalists about how hard it is to break into leadership roles. Someone told me that in press conferences, they are not taken seriously; that rising through the ranks to be managers is difficult here. I am personally very lucky because at CNN I have been given a lot of opportunities. I became an anchor after joining the company for about a year and half; which is unheard of.\n\nDuring the International Women\u2019s Week, the whole point is \u2018Breaking the Bias.\u2019 This is what everyone is talking about. But I think that we need to see more women supporting women. Women who have managed to rise to the ranks, especially entrepreneurs; I love the idea of seeing more of those women take younger women under their wings to show them how they did it.\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit is one thing that Nigeria has to offer the world. It is so amazing here. The talent and motivation among male and female entrepreneurs is amazing. Everyone knows Mo Abudu, she has done really well for herself. But I hope to see more female entrepreneurs in the media space. And I want to see more people who have managed to achieve a lot in the media space helping other women do the same.\n\nWould you wish for your child to follow in this pathway of yours?\n\nI want my children to be happy and to do what they love to do. As a mother, my job is to expose my children as much as possible to everything, even though they are very young so they can pick what they are going to fall in love with. Because there is no point forcing a child to do what a child doesn\u2019t love; nobody wins in this particular situation. I am a journalist and I have done very well. My brother is an actor and he is doing very well. If my mother had forced him to become a doctor, it would not have worked out. It worked out because my mother was very supportive of our dreams and because I grew up in that kind of household, I am going to do the same for my children.\n\nWhat motivates you to keep going on?\n\nI am a spiritual person and I believe in God and I also believe that as someone who has been blessed so much, I have the responsibility to bless others. People reach out to me and if somebody has taken the time to track me down and find my email address and ask me for help and advice especially, I will do what I can. I think I have done that for a lot of people. That is what motivates me to keep going; knowing that I am here to share information but really to serve and that is what keeps me going.\n\nHow is it like being in an interracial marriage?\n\nIt is normal. It is the same as being in any other marriage. Obviously there are some challenges to it. After George Floyd, race really became a vocal point of discussion in the country. I think that was a great awakening in the United States because people really began to see that there were big race issues that we needed to wake up to address. I did notice that a lot of corporations and a lot of companies began to take racial representations and diversity much more seriously. Companies started dedicating a certain percentage of their space to black-owned businesses. It became that much important to lift up black owned businesses and black owned brands. In terms of my marriage to my husband, I assure you that the marriage is perfectly normal.\n\nWere your parents in full support of your marriage?\n\nMy father passed on when I was young, so I just grew up with my mum. My mother was one hundred percent supportive. My mum loves my husband. My mother and my husband talk all the time. They have a really good relationship. My mother just saw that I was happy. My father died when I was five and my mother was about 36 years old. She never remarried, so it has been quite lonely for her. So, when she saw that I had met a man that I was in love with and really happy to be with, she supported us.\n\nRead also: Interview: Maintain a different account for your business \u2014 Kosi Ofodile\n\nYou wrote a new book. What is the book about?\n\nThe book is titled \u2018Where the Children Take Us.\u2019 This is about my mum\u2019s resilience and courage. It is really a celebration of her because in September 1988, my mother got a phone call and she didn\u2019t really know who the person was when she answered the phone. But the voice on the other end said to her that her husband and son were involved in a car crash and one of them was dead but they do not know which one. My mum went all the way to Nigeria not knowing if she was going to bury her husband or her son. My father and my brother were on a road trip in Nigeria during the car crash. So she got that phone call and it really shattered the family because it was so much pain and heart break.\n\nSo, the book is really about how this woman who was a single mother, widow and immigrant in the UK managed to raise four children who succeeded every possible expectation. I work at CNN, my brother is an actor, my sister is a doctor and my other brother is a successful entrepreneur. So, people are going to ask how she did it and they always ask.

          "text": "Q: The military is involved in several operations across the country? What will be a fair assessment of the results achieved so far?\n\nA: Depending on who you ask, the answers may be different.\n\nFirst, I share in the unbearable pain of those who have lost family members and friends due to activities of criminals and terrorists. I have also felt the heartbeat of the thousands rescued; joy on the faces of the free.\n\nThis makes the goal of our military operations across the country so important \u2013 Every member of Nigeria\u2019s 50 million families must be safe from external and internal aggression.\n\nThe recent report from the 2022 global terrorism index reveals a decline in the prevalence of terrorism in Nigeria. Based on our assessment, the military is using all within its capacity and capabilities to achieve this goal.\n\nIn all, let us never forget that security is not a destination, it is a journey, and we are on the right path.\n\nQ: What are the biggest obstacles to ending the war on terrorism?\n\nA: There are several perspectives; especially on the debate on which should be prioritized \u2013 kinetic or the non-kinetic approach.\n\nOne thing that most stakeholders agree on is that the high rate of population growth has been a double edged sword. Ordinarily, higher population means there is a larger talent pool for economic growth activities; but this larger talent pool has also led to a significant growth in the number of those who are being lured to use their energies negatively.\n\nRead also: Over 1,000 Boko Haram fighters surrender to troops in Northeast\n\nQ: What role will fake news play in the fight against terrorism in 2022?\n\nA: Terrorists and terrorism thrive on publicity. In 2022, many news consumers may even find it more difficult to differentiate between true and fake security stories.\n\nFor instance, a while ago, we intercepted communication from a criminal gang who were part of an incident. This criminal gang was highly dissatisfied that the incident was not reported in the press. Terrorism thrives on the promotion of fear; especially the continuous coverage of terror incidents.\n\nMore than ever before, it has become necessary for journalists not to unintentionally align with the strategy of the terrorists.\n\nIt is not the military alone that is fighting terrorism; it is the country; so the solution should not be limited to only the military. Citizens also can also assist by sharing information before incidents happen.\n\nQ: We are gradually getting to the end of the first quarter of 2022, how you will rate the performance of the army with regards to national security\n\nA: Military operations have improved this year because of the tough choices and decisions the President and commander in chief of the Armed Forces made in the last 12 months; especially regarding defense related investments.\n\nHowever, national security and defense should not be the responsibility of only the military.\n\nResearch has proven that the military line of operation is less than 20% of what is required to achieve complete peace.\n\nFor instance, the military is sometimes called when there are cult related threats and attacks; but let us not forget that the causes and sources of cultism should also be identified. It is an all of society approach that is required to achieve peace in our nation.\n\nRead also: 5 things that stand out from National Security summit report\n\nQ: What are the new strategies in place to improve operational synergy among the Army, Navy and Air Force?cv\n\nA: Synergy is presently at its highest. There is no time in recent history that it has been better than this. Every day, we raise our standards.\n\nPresident Reagan once said, \u201cThe greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.\u201d\n\nGetting people to do the greatest things is what the Chief of Defense Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor has done differently.",

We want Edo to be a hub of tourism. Traffic is already building in Edo as over a million people are coming into the state. Our projection is that in three years time, five million will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have access to resources that can be brought to help us redefine where we are going,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cYusuf Ali, the Chairman of the Edo Sports Commission has excelled, both locally and internationally. In Edo, we have to catch them young in sports. Almost a million of our young generation are under the age of 12. We must rethink sports and catch them young.\n\n\u201c40 years ago, government regulated, operated and participated in sports, putting all the resources required into sports. Our emphasis today, as a government, is to continue to provide policy direction for sports.\u201d\n\nNoting that there\u2019s a lot of money outside government to finance and sustain sports, the governor said his administration is redesigning the state\u2019s sports policy and creating new laws to regulate sports, and bring capable and competent persons to help manage sports in the state.\n\nHe further noted, \u201cEdo State can start now to prepare for a global market in sports by identifying young talents in schools and catching them young. In five years time, the state can train about 10,000 to 20,000 talents and if 1,000 of these talents become global stars, the state will benefit greatly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad you have accepted to serve but I advise you to separate politics from sports if we must succeed in our plans. We should excel in all areas of sports as we continue to invest in sports development.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Edo State Sports Commission, Yusuf Ali pledged that his team will do their best to transform sports in Edo.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Godwin Obaseki of Edo has charged the State Sports Commission Board to develop 10,000 athletes in different fields of sports in the next five years.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor gave the charge while inaugurating the Yusuf Alli-led Sports Commission on Saturday in Benin.\n\nHe admonished the commission to pursue policies that would ensure the dominance of the state in the entire country in terms of the development and training of athletes.\n\n\u201cEdo is synonymous with sports, we owe what we met on the ground to the next generation. We have to catch them young, we have to rethink sports with all the resources we have.\n\n\u201cWe have to catch them in schools and those outside schools. Success to me will be when we have more that 10,000 Edo sports people.\n\n\u201cThey should be young men and women, who are so good in sports and who can find opportunities locally, nationally and globally.\n\n\u201cPeople need to prepare for the global market, why can\u2019t we start now?\n\n\u201cWe just have to catch them young whether it is in swimming, tennis, basketball, table tennis, handball or football.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to say in five years time we have trained between 10,000 to 20,000 and if 1,000 of those become global stars, see what that would do for us,\u201d he stated.\n\nObaseki also urged the commission to tap into funding from the private sector to develop infrastructure and drive sporting activities.\n\nHe called for total reform and transparency in the administration of sports associations.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cPrivate capital is fundamentally different from the way government capital behaves.\n\n\u201cThere is a high level of transparency because anybody who puts money down wants to see where that money is going to and how that money is being spent.\n\n\u201cThis is because if they don\u2019t see it you can\u2019t attract more. So, we can\u2019t run the associations the way we used to.\n\n\u201cSports is sports, politics is politics, let\u2019s separate them. Sports is professional, let\u2019s bring that level of professionalism to it.\n\n\u201cEdo today has the number one cricket team in Nigeria through private sector spending. I want to see the same in swimming, in gymnastics, in volleyball and handball.\n\n\u201cI want to walk around neighbourhoods and see the availability of courts; courts for different sports, and I believe there are private people ready to make that investment if we give them a clear direction on how to come in.\u201d\n\nNAN reports that Yusuf Alli, a one-time Captain of Team Nigeria and national long jump record holder is the commission\u2019s Chairman and Sabina Chikere is the Permanent Secretary.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Electoral Act 2022: Constitutionality of section 84(12) as argued by Buhari",
          "text": "By Monday Onyekachi Ubani\n\nTo the excitement of all and sundry, especially to those patriotic Nigerians that desire sound electoral legal framework for our fledging democracy, the assent of the President of the Amended Electoral Bill was a welcome development and was greeted with wide applause.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that Nigerians will never get it right with leadership if the Electoral legal framework remains archaic and bereft of principles that ensure the votes of the majority count.\n\nThe Amended Electoral Bill introduced some innovations, particularly the reception of limited e-voting and holistic e-transmission of electoral results.\n\nThe major aspect of our electoral stages where manipulations graduate to infamy is at the stage of collation and counting of electoral results. All kinds of malfeasance including criminal input of strange figures in the electoral result sheets usually occur at this stage.\n\nTo cure to a certain extent the bizarre input of un-earned votes by the electoral umpire, the nation canvased and compelled the legislators to insert the clause that adopted electronic transmission of results to eliminate the meddlesomeness of human interference in the system that usually gives birth to strange electoral victories at the poll.\n\nSound and welcome development you will agree with me. However, the President after much persuasion decided to assent to the bill but with a caveat that the National Assembly should ensure that Section 84(12) of the Act be amended as its provision offends the express provision of the constitution pertaining to the rights of certain political class (Appointed Political Office Holders) to associate and participate in the political system in the country.\n\nThe offending Section provides that \u201cNo political appointee AT ANY LEVEL shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nS84(13) further provides that \u201cwhere a political party fails to comply with the provision of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\u201d\n\nThis section truly speaking, disenfranchises political office holders who are appointees of the governor or president from participating at the primary election of the party either as a delegate or as a candidate.\n\nWhen President Buhari was signing this law and was raising his preliminary objection to it, many of us including my humble self did not see the harmful effect as seen by him. The Section is a very dangerous provision.\n\nWe had felt that President Buhari\u2019s complaints and delay in signing the bill was a delay too many and that he should just sign the bill and let us move on as a nation. Recall that the first time the bill was passed and brought to President Buhari, he refused assent citing the provision on party primaries as his reason. Tempers grew and voices were raised against his refusal to sign. The bill when returned was amended to reflect the wish of the President.\n\nIt was a great relief to many Nigerians when the President eventually assented to the bill but with a very serious objection. He sought and received assurance from the leadership of the National Assembly that they will accede to his request to amend the offensive section.\n\nWith the initial reluctance of the President to sign the Bill despite majority voice that he should, nobody was ready to look at the genuiness of the President\u2019s complaints this second time around despite the fact that his complaints may have some undisputable weight.\n\nA careful perusal of the Act reveals a sinister motive meant to pave way to the \u201celected office holders\u201d to have an undue advantage over and above every other political office aspirant in Nigeria. This is pure evil and should not be allowed to stand.\n\nThis Section really offends the provision on the fundamental right against Discrimination. Section 42 of the 1999 Constitution provides as follows:\n\n(1) A citizen of Nigeria of a particular community, ethnic group, place of origin, sex, religion or political opinion shall not, by reason only that he is such a person:- (a) be subjected either expressly by, or in the practical application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any executive or administrative action of the government, to disabilities or restrictions to which citizens of Nigeria of other communities, ethnic groups, places of origin, sex, religions or\n\npolitical opinions are not made subject; or (b) be accorded either expressly by, or in the\n\npractical application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any such executive or administrative\n\naction, any privilege or advantage that is not accorded to citizens of Nigeria of other\n\ncommunities, ethnic groups, places of origin, sex, religions or political opinions.\n\nThe summary of the above provision is that it will amount to violation of right against discrimination if someone is denied a right or position that another person of his class or group is allowed to enjoy.\n\nSection 84(12) restricts a political appointee from contesting or voting in the primary election of his political party unless he resigns but the same law allows legislators, governors, local government chairmen who are members of the same political class with the Appointees to remain on their seats to vote and be voted for. This appears absurd, illogical and unacceptable.\n\nThe Court of Appeal in Segun Oni Vs Kayode Fayemi has described Political Appointees as not Public Servants who are bound by the mandatory 30 days resignation clause that they must comply to if they must contest election.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not disturb this decision as it upheld the decision of the Court below by dismissing the appeal on the ground that Segun Oni filed his appeal out of time.\n\nThat decision remains a precedence till date. In other words Political Appointees are not public servants employed in the public service that should resign from office before running for an office.\n\nIf the constitution of 1999 as Amended and approved by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Segun Oni Vs Fayemi held the view that A Political Appointee is not bound to resign from office 30 days before election as Section 318 of the Constitution never qualifies him or her as a Public Servant where does S84(12) derive its validity to disenfrachise the office of political appointee from voting and contesting for a primary election in his political party?\n\nPlethora of authorities have established the principle that where a provision of an enactment by the legislature conflicts with the express provision of the constitution, the said extant law shall be declared null and void for conflicting with the supreme provision of the constitution. That is the essence of S1(3) of the 1999 constitution as Amended. It provides and I quote \u201cIf any other law is inconsistent with the provision of this constitution, this constitution shall prevail, and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void\u201d.\n\nIf the grundnum of the land does not disqualify a political appointee from voting and contesting for an election in his political party, the new Amended Electoral Act does not possess the requisite vires to so do, and as long as it tends to do this, it has to be set aside as it runs contrary to the express provision of the 1999 constitution with regards to Right against Discrimination, Association etc. The validity of this assertion shall be so tested in our vibrant judiciary.\n\nDr. M.O. Ubani is a Legal Practitioner and chairman of NBA SPIDEL",

          "title": "2023: Dele Momodu warns RCCG, Adeboye against backing Osinbajo",
          "text": "Presidential hopeful and Ovation Magazine publisher, Dele Momodu, has warned the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) and its general overseer, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, against supporting Nigeria\u2019s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo for 2023 presidency.\n\nMomodu, a member of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) who has since declared his intention to run for president, gave the warning in a post, titled, \u2018My Kobo Advice To The Redeemed Christian Church Of God (RCCG).\u201d\n\nHe argued that supporting Osinbajo\u2019s alleged presidential ambition will lead to moral crisis for the church.\n\nThe warning comes after RCCG created the Office of Directorate of Politics and Governance to support members willing to be involved in politics and \u201cmobilise support for them when required.\u201d\n\nThe development led to speculations that the church may be trying to mobilize support for the vice president, but Pastor Olaitan Olubiyi, RCCG Head of Media and Public Relations, who spoke to PUNCH, said the newly created Office has nothing to do with Osinbajo or any person who may have political ambition in 2023.\n\nBut Momodu, in the lengthy post, warned leaders of the Church, saying the easiest way to create trouble in Nigeria today is to attempt to mix religion with politics.\n\n\u201cNaturally, I feel that I owe it a duty to tell our Church leaders, and our Church in general, the Gospel truth and nothing but the absolute truth. In the light of my relationship with the RCCG, this duty is even more imperative and compelling. I believe the leaders of the RCCG have laboured so hard to build one of the most formidable churches in the world,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cNothing must be done to inadvertently cause a cataclysmic storm in the House of God. And the easiest way to create trouble in Nigeria today is any attempt to mix religion with politics. It goes beyond lighting the blue touch paper. It is like combining some highly combustible ingredients together in a chemical laboratory. It is not just that the effect may not be too pleasant, it is that the result and consequences will be catastrophic. God forbid.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I read the memo establishing a political arm of our Church, I realised this was nothing but an invitation to Armageddon, if true. For that reason, at first, I assumed the memo was a joke, a fake document that was merely meant to stir the hornets\u2019 nest, so I did not pay too much attention to it. However, when it started flying in from every direction to my phones, I knew someone had touched the tiger by the tail. I started working the phones to speak to a few contacts who should know about it and be able to confirm the veracity or otherwise of the document. The outcome was a resounding yes, the document had emanated from the Church and was acquiesced to by the upper echelons.\n\n\u201cI asked for what the motive(s) could have been, and the general conspiracy theory was that our church was setting up an extensive network for the obvious Presidential ambition of the current Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, although couched in terms which ostensibly suggested that the Church wished to support all of its congregation who wished to contest the next general elections and made their aspirations known to the newly formed Church department. Personally, that theory didn\u2019t jell with me. To the best of my knowledge, Professor Osinbajo is not the only member of the church contesting the Presidential election. And it was not the church that nominated him as running mate to President Muhammadu Buhari. He got the job primarily because of his closeness to his former Principal, then Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and also because of his admirable credentials, ability and capacity. His religion was necessarily a factor because a Northern Moslem must perforce pick a Southern Christian as his running mate in the current Nigerian clime. That was the only reason religion came into it, I believe. It had nothing to do with the fact that he is a senior pastor of the RCCG.\n\n\u201cEven if the Vice President has now decided to bear his own father\u2019s name by dropping that of his avuncular godfather, the church will still face a moral crisis if it wishes to jump on the bandwagon by drumming up support for Professor Osinbajo on religious grounds alone for many reasons, some of which I will now highlight.\u201d\n\nDele Momodu reminded the RCCG that Osinbajo is not the only member of the Church who might have an ambition for the Presidency. According to him, he\u2019s also a member of the RCCG with his ambition for the 2023 Presidency already public.\n\nThis is as he pointed out that Senator Remi Tinubu is a member of the Church who is married to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, a Muslim that has declared his ambition for the 2023 Presidency.\n\n\u201cAlthough Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a Muslim, his dear beloved wife, Senator Oluremi Tinubu is a staunch member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God and one of the leading lights of the Church. Asiwaju, her husband, is a frontline Presidential aspirant on the platform of APC, just like his godson, the Vice President. Even if the RCCG has a preference in Professor Osinbajo, mainly because of his status in the Church and his current position in Government, I expect the RCCG to \u201cpretend\u201d a little and behave as if it is not so. Not to do that would be tantamount to picking a child out of one\u2019s children and say, \u201cthis is my favourite!\u201d It is simply not right or proper for the RCCG to demonstrate such blatant and flagrant partisanship,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs if that is not a tough cookie to handle, there is the fact that that there is a third contender, yours truly, Dele Momodu, who\u2019s also a member of the RCCG and the youngest of the contending Church aspirants so far. I\u2019m also the only member of the RCCG aspiring on the platform of PDP, as far as I know. Would the Church then ask its congregation to vote for one party over the other merely because it has decided to support one candidate in preference to the other regardless of the strong points one may have over the other? What a conundrum and crisis this portends for the Church and its unity and peace.\n\n\u201cThe church cannot even afford to ostracise any aspirant on the basis of religious persuasion or denomination. It is the job of the church to seek out and promote the best candidates and then pray for them and galvanise support for them perhaps clandestinely.\n\n\u201cI also imagine that there is some degree of unconstitutionality to this attempt by the RCCG to descend into the political arena. Nigeria is a secular state as the constitution provides. To suggest that one candidate is the preferred candidate of a particular church or religious group and is being effectively sponsored by that church will breach not just the morality and ethos of the Church but also the deeply enshrined principles and ground norm of our constitution, which are embedded and engraved for good reason.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there are no guarantees that being a church Pastor or otherwise would make you a competent and truthfully honest leader. The church is too massive and extremely influential to reduce itself to such a level of myopia. Since what most Nigerians desire today is good and accountable leadership, our Churches should smartly work towards identifying the best materials in different political parties and support us spiritually and materially from the humongous resources it has pleased God to bless them with.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, it is my belief that our churches should avoid anything that could further escalate the huge religious and socio-political conflagration already ravaging our long-suffering nation. Just imagine what would happen if other church denominations or other religions decide to support their own members only. It would be palpable anarchy in the making. Nigeria will then end up with a Babel of voices and a cacophony of noises which would not augur well for the wellbeing of us all, but only cause misery and upheaval.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope and pray that our Church, the RCCG, will douse this unnecessary fire and recant and retrace its steps before it is too late.\u201d",

Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov and Maj. Gen.

          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has broken his silence over the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Garba Shehu, the president warned the leaders and members of APC to desist from \u201cname-calling and backstabbing\u201d.\n\nHe reiterated that the party\u2019s national convention would hold on March 26.\n\nThe president urged APC members to \u201cremain steadfast and maintain unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country\u201d.\n\nThe statement also quoted Buhari as asking members of the party to \u201clook at the once-powerful, main opposition Peoples Democratic Party now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey (PDP) failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our own share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201cBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate.\n\n\u201cAs the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that APC started out with a confidence of victory and enjoyed confidence in nearly two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\n\u201cThis is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\n\u201cThis alone, in addition to the fact that we didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandisement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\n\n\u201cGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\nThe president, however, blamed the role of the media in the crisis rocking the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\u201cOf course, the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.\u201d\n\nDetails later\u2026",

He timed his run to perfection as Jadon Sancho made the most of Sergio Reguilon\u2019s struggles within the Tottenham defensive line to deliver the low cross that his vastly experienced team-mate turned home with ease.\n\nAnd if anyone was likely to get a winner, it was United\u2019s number seven.\n\nWhen he did, Ronaldo was immediately replaced to a standing ovation that was totally deserved.",

Many were dismissed one way or the other.\n\n\u201cEven in the Soviet Union, there were ways; Stalin was said to have been poisoned, Khrushchev was just escorted out of the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cWith Putin, I very much expect there to be resistance growing and discontent growing that will be resolved one way or another.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know which way but Russian history is full of unexpected outcomes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about Putin\u2019s decision to invade, Mr Kozyrev said: \u201cIt\u2019s horrific but it\u2019s not irrational. To understand why the invasion was rational for Putin, we have to step into his shoes.\u201d\n\nMr Kozyrev, who now lives in Miami, believes Putin is not insane, but \u201csimply wrong and immoral\u201d.\n\nIt comes as reports suggested Russian forces made progress overnight from north-east Ukraine in their fight to reach the capital Kyiv.",

Raine already confirmed they will be waiting to hear a proper offer for the club from now until the Tuesday dealine so anything can happen from now until then.\n\nIn Ireland, Conor McGregor already made his offer but it\u2019s far below what the other candidates have. If the UFC legend wants to buy Chelsea, he will have to upgrade his current offer of \u00a31.5 billion.\n\nIt is believed that an acceptable offer would be of around \u00a33 billion in order to consider it properly.\n\nHowever, the club\u2019s dire situation could push them to accept a lower offer than that.",

          "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo set another goalscoring record in a return to form with a hat-trick to keep Manchester United\u2019s chances of playing in the Champions League next season alive with a 3-2 win over Tottenham on Saturday.\n\nRonaldo had scored just once in his previous 10 games, but three fantastic finishes took him clear as the highest scorer in professional men\u2019s football history according to FIFA\u2019s records with 807 goals for club and country.\n\nVictory lifts United back into fourth, although they are just two points ahead of Arsenal who have four games in hand.\n\nA fifth defeat in eight league games is another blow to Tottenham\u2019s hopes of a top-four finish as they remain seventh, now five points behind United.\n\nREAD ALSO: Liverpool Sink Brighton To Move Within Three Points Of Man City\n\nRonaldo\u2019s second spell at Old Trafford has so far proven to be an anti-climax with his poor form sparking debate over whether the 37-year-old\u2019s powers are waning.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner missed United\u2019s thrashing in the Manchester derby last weekend and was criticised for a perceived lack of commitment as he jetted off to Portugal to rehab a hip injury rather than watch his teammates lost 4-1 at the Etihad.\n\nHe was restored to Ralf Rangnick\u2019s starting line-up as one of five changes from that damaging defeat with Bruno Fernandes the notable absentee due to illness.\n\nIt took just 12 minutes for Ronaldo to make his mark with a stunning strike into the top corner from outside the box.\n\nHowever, United failed to build on the early goal and were instead forced back in a familiar pattern to previous home games this season against stronger opposition.\n\nSpurs quickly had the ball in the net in response only for Ben Davies to be flagged offside before Eric Dier\u2019s header from a corner was cleared off the line.\n\nA Tottenham equaliser seemed only a matter of time and was gifted to them when Alex Telles handled Dejan Kulusevski\u2019s cross for a clear penalty.\n\nHarry Kane smashed home the resulting spot-kick to continue his fine form for his sixth goal in as many games.\n\nWithin three minutes, though, United were back in front thanks to a landmark goal for Ronaldo.\n\nHe turned home Jadon Sancho\u2019s inviting cross to surpass Austria-Czech striker Josef Bican as football\u2019s all-time record goalscorer according to FIFA\u2019s records.\n\nUnited\u2019s defensive deficiencies meant Ronaldo\u2019s work was not done to win the game as Spurs enjoyed the better of the second half.\n\nSon Heung-min hooked a glorious chance wide from Kulusevski\u2019s cut-back.\n\nWhen a second equaliser did arrive for Antonio Conte\u2019s men it was thanks to more misery for United captain Harry Maguire.\n\nConsistent errors from the England international have played a huge part in his side\u2019s struggles this season and he turned into his own net from Sergio Reguilon\u2019s cross.\n\nConte screamed for focus from his side on the sideline, but they succumbed again to Ronaldo\u2019s predatory instincts.\n\nThe United number seven rose highest to meet Telles\u2019 corner nine minutes from time to power a header into the top corner for just his second United hat-trick and first since returning to Old Trafford in August.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari warns the leaders (and membership) of the All Progressives Party (APC) to desist from name-calling and backstabbing ahead of the oncoming March 26 Convention, remain steadfast and maintain its unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country.\n\nPresident Buhari asks the members to look at the once-powerful, \u201cmain opposition\u201d Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption.\n\n\u201dThey failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201d\u201cYes, we are entitled to our own share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201dBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate,\u201d the President warned.\n\n\u201dAs the country prepares for the long run up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that the APC started out with a confidence of victory and the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\nThis alone, addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\nThe party, he went on to note, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition Governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\nIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\nWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\nIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No-one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\nOf course the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\nThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.",

          "title": "INEC letter: Bello's CECPC makes u-turn, says Buni still in charge -",
          "text": "The Governor Abdullahi Sani Bello-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has made a U-Turn moments after a leaked letter from the Independent National Electoral Commission had subtly rejected the invitation to the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party.\n\nThe Bello-led CECPC had on Wednesday, 8 March written to the electoral body inviting it to the emergency NEC meeting of the party. The INEC in its reply stated clearly that the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC, runs contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2014).\n\nAddressing the media at the Buhari House National Secretariat of the party on Friday in Abuja, the Spokesman of the CECPC, Ismaeel Ahmed, said, \u201cSomebody asked, what is the position of Governor Mai Mala Buni in the party, I think it\u2019s pretty simple. I don\u2019t know why this is a complicated process for a lot of people not to understand. Since the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020, whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of all as the Chairman.\n\n\u201cIt has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case. Now, we have a Convention on March 26. The chairman wrote a letter and transmitted power to Governor Bello to enable him go for medical treatment. Those are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency, that cannot wait for Convention. We have a Convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy.\n\n\u201cSo, one has to leave for the other, whichever, he has transmitted a letter and Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately. Why is it so difficult for people to understand that? Why is it so difficult for people to simply understand? I cannot understand why people are making this allegation.\n\n\u201cSo, Governor Sani Bello is acting the full authority of the Caretaker Committee and with the full authority of the stakeholders and with the full consent of Governor Mai Mala Buni. It is very clear and simple. If anybody has issues with any of our decisions, he can head to court. For now, we are doing it with the full backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity on this, absolutely none.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of Senator John James Akpanudodehe, what is the position because I spelt others out the other members of the committee, but I didn\u2019t say anything about other people as well, we just talked about members of the committee. I didn\u2019t talk about their positions, whether secretary or chairman, since they have their responsibilities spelt out for them.\n\n\u201cThe other members are the ones told to come back to handle specific departments and that is what we are doing. At the full course of time, once all these are over, I will be able to brief you. But for now, these are the responsibilities of every member.\n\n\u201cAs part of efforts towards the hitch-free conduct of the March 26th National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) stepped up preparations this week.\n\n\u201cConvened a meeting chaired by the Acting Chairman and Governor of Niger State, H.E. Abubakar Sani Bello, where strategies were adopted to fast-track the process towards conducting a National Convention;\n\n\u201c35 State chairmen of the APC and that of the FCT were sworn-in and mandated to work towards ensuring unity and harmony in their states. They were also charged to mobilise the members and the people to enable the party win future elections;\n\n\u201cReceived and deliberated on the report of the Committee on zoning. After exhaustively deliberating on the report, it was approved and the zoning formula was made public. The zoning formula was well-received by members of the party and all Nigerians;\n\n\u201cAssigned schedules of specific responsibilities to each members of the Caretaker Committee aligned to the existing Directorates at the Party\u2019s headquarters. The purpose is to ensure speedy execution of the various activities leading to the National Convention on March 26, 2022. The exercise has the additional benefit of ensuring synergy between the leadership of the party and the Directorates.\n\n\u201cDeliberated on and disagreed with the Federal High Court in its judgement on the status of the Governor of Ebonyi state over his sound decision to leave the PDP and join the APC along with the majority of members of the State House Assembly; CECPC regards the judgement as a travesty of justice and stand with the Governor and Ebonyi state legislators on appealing to a higher court;\n\n\u201cStreamlined and expanded the leadership of the various sub committees for the conduct of National Convention by bringing in more Governors and Ministers of the Federal Republic to spearhead the process. This has obviously fostered and deepened sense of belonging, inclusiveness and reflect the mosaic nature of the membership of the party;\n\n\u201cReviewed and strengthened the membership of the National Convention Subcommittees by making them compact and lighter. The subcommittees earlier composed were unnecessarily unwieldy and comprised excessive number of members, a situation that can reduce their efficiency;\n\n\u201cThe CECPC committee chaired by His Excellency the Governor of Niger State has issued a notice for a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party on March 17, 2022. As usual, a number of important issues will be discussed at the meeting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to questions from journalists, Ismaeel Ahmed disclosed that the previously scheduled Zonal Congresses will now be part of the National Convention. He assured that the March 26th National Convention was on course and sacrosanct.",

Chelsea had company credit cards from Barclaycard frozen as a result of the sanctions.\n\nBowing to pressure against his ongoing ownership, Abramovich had already announced last week before being sanctioned that he would put Chelsea up for sale.\n\nThe government now has oversight of the sale process which the Raine Group, an investment bank, is working on.\n\nAbramovich originally hoped to divert the proceeds into a new foundation for the victims of the war in Ukraine, which he is yet to condemn Putin for launching. But the government will only sanction a sale that does not see Abramovich benefit as the government tightens the screw on influential individuals it views as enabling Putin\u2019s regime.\n\n\u201cProceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions,\u201d the government has said.\n\nSome Chelsea fans have continued to stand by Abramovich during the opening two weeks of the war, even chanting his name at a game last weekend that the league hoped to use to show solidarity to Ukraine and the victims of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nAbramovich\u2019s disqualification by the Premier League halts the reign of the competition\u2019s first billionaire foreign owner, whose fortune turned Chelsea into one of the biggest-spending clubs in Europe and one of the game\u2019s most successful. His investment ended Chelsea\u2019s 50-year domestic title drought when the league was won in 2005 and the trophy has been collected another four times.\n\nThe team is the reigning European and world champion thanks to spending on players that has seen Abramovich inject more than 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) into Chelsea through loans he said he will not ask to be repaid.\n\nAbramovich has made no comment since being sanctioned.",

          "title": "As Cairo Transforms, Egyptians Fight to Save Their Trees",
          "text": "Asmar said that between August 2019 and January 2020, Heliopolis lost an estimated 396,000 square meters (about 100 acres) of green space.\n\nPart of the adjoining park was razed to erect a stone monument commemorating Cairo\u2019s road and highways development, while a nearby public garden dating from the early 20th century was demolished to make way for a new street and state-owned gas station.\n\nAsmar and other residents of Heliopolis \u2014 an old neighborhood that boasts some of the city\u2019s most important early 20th-century buildings \u2014 numbered the trees lining Nehru Street, labeling each of them after famous Egyptian figures. Five days later, police took the signs down and Asmar got a warning from security officials. The trees have survived, for now, while many others nearby have not, their wood sawed into pieces and towed away in trucks.\n\nEgyptian authorities were planning to clear out a large avenue of ficus, acacia and palm trees \u2014 part of sweeping urban redevelopment projects that are transforming much of historic Cairo.\n\nA few months ago, Choucri Asmar decided he wasn\u2019t ready to give up hope. So he led a group of residents in \u201ca peaceful demonstration to protect the trees\u201d of his Cairo neighborhood.\n\n\u201cAnd then we stopped counting, but lost much more,\u201d he said. He described feeling disoriented on once-familiar streets.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly 73 football fields worth of greenery in just one neighborhood of the sprawling metropolis that stretches from the Pyramids at Giza in the west, across the Nile River, to new modern developments in the east. Heliopolis accounts for no more than one fifth of the capital in area. Cairo\u2019s population of roughly 20 million is spread over some 648 square kilometers (250 square miles), making it one of the densest cities in the world.\n\nEgypt\u2019s environmental record is under scrutiny as it hosts the U.N. climate conference COP27 in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh in November.\n\nAn official at Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Environment did not respond to a request for comment on the loss of urban green spaces. Other officials have said that better roads will ease traffic, and promised that the new developments will include large parks and incorporate as much vegetation as possible. One plan, announced in government media, is for a park in the historic center, incorporating a large archeological zone.\n\nMuch of Cairo\u2019s redesign and new highways aim to service a new capital under construction on the city\u2019s outskirts. It\u2019s the flagship mega-project of President Abdel Fattah El-Sissi, who says he is rebuilding the economy after years of political turmoil.\n\nIn recent years, grassroots groups have sprung up in different areas of Cairo to try to protect the city\u2019s urban identity. Asmar is a member of the Heliopolis Heritage Initiative, founded in 2011.\n\nSarah Rifaat lives a five-minute walk from Mesaha Square, a rare leafy spot in Giza, a neighborhood of high-rises. A few months ago, she was jolted into action by a video of a forklift leveling the square\u2019s garden. She joined a WhatsApp group where residents expressed concern over the loss of green space. Residents organized a petition, but paving over of the garden continued.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of collective connection to trees that I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d she said.\n\nActivists have scored some wins, including halting the commercial redevelopment of the Fish Garden, a park in the city\u2019s central Zamalek area. Rifaat has seen some urban improvements initiated by city officials as well, but says there is no accountability among decision-makers.\n\nCairenes are struggling to come to terms with a rapidly changing city, where many public spaces have been taken away or commercialized, she said. Rifaat believes that protecting neighborhoods has become a final form of protest, as the space for civil society in Egypt keeps shrinking.\n\nBacked up by residential groups across the city, environmental lawyer Ahmed Elseidi is leading a case before Egypt\u2019s highest administrative court that he hopes will oblige the government to replant trees and protect Cairo\u2019s few remaining green spaces.\n\nThe government is required by law to carry out public consultations and environmental impact reports on highway construction that has torn through many old neighborhoods, he said. The law protects green spaces, designating trees as public property, he added.\n\nElseidi said he has submitted documents showing that no environmental studies were conducted ahead of any road projects, including in Heliopolis.\n\nRim Hamdy, a botany professor at Cairo University, said some types of trees could vanish from city streets. Thirty-five varieties of Australian eucalyptus once grew along Giza streets but dozens have been felled. Even the nearby Agricultural Ministry\u2019s plant nursery has been bulldozed, she said.\n\nMany tree species and public gardens are a legacy of Egypt\u2019s 19th-century rulers, who planted thousands of trees as they rebuilt Cairo. They imported specimens \u2014 including flowering purple jacaranda and red poinciana \u2014 that became signatures of Cairo\u2019s streets.\n\nHamdy plans to petition authorities to allow her to trim and protect a century-old sycamore fig outside her university.\n\nIn Maadi, an area known for its leafy squares and villas, the Tree Lovers Association is one of the city\u2019s oldest neighborhood groups.\n\nAssociation member Samia Zeitoun said the authorities have responded to some of the public complaints about development.\n\n\u201cCairo was choking, so it\u2019s a big challenge for the government to open up arteries,\u201d she said, raising the issue of overcrowding in the city that grows by the thousands every day.\n\nAs Egypt prepares to host COP27, activists say green spaces help reduce Cairo\u2019s heavy pollution and lower scorching summer temperatures in urban areas.",

          "title": "US to Partner Nigeria to Stop Gas Flaring By Conversion to Ammonia",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s energy transition agenda, in line with global direction received a boost on Thursday at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, Texas, as the United States\u2019 Government indicated interest in a bi-lateral partnership that would see the conversion of the enormous gas resources currently being flared to ammonia.\n\nAmmonia has the potential of being a huge revenue earner for the country especially as the European Union, in pursuit of the net zero-emission programme, has unveiled its long-anticipated plans to make importers and non-EU manufacturers pay for the carbon emissions associated with the goods and materials they sell in the EU, thus impacting on vessels powered by fossils fuels entering EU territory.\n\nSince running such vessels during that tax regime will not be economically viable, there is the need to redesign engines of such vessels; and attention is already being focused on ammonia as an alternative fuel source, to replace heating oil and other fossil fuels. The resort to ammonia is because it is not just cleaner, but a cheaper source of energy.\n\nInvariably, it means there would no longer be an easy and attractive market for heating oil, one of the most highly sought-after products in the configuration of Nigeria\u2019s refineries. The adoption of the Carbon Border Tax by the EU has the potential of hurting the Nigerian economy which is largely serviced with proceeds from its hydrocarbon potentials. This would compound the challenge already posed by the vigorous pursuit of the zero-emission plan by the developed countries, due to the reduced earnings from Nigeria\u2019s refinery configured products such as heating oil (i.e. LPFO, HPFO).\n\nThe Paris Agreement and the United Nation\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to limit the development of oil and gas projects in the pursuit of more environment friendly energy options \u2013 from fossil fuels to green and renewable energy \u2013 in the next two decades. This poses enough threat to the country\u2019s major revenue stream, which is why sustaining current revenue drivers and considering other viable options became the major thrust of discussions by Nigeria at the conference.\n\nThe energy transition agenda therefore became the centre of focus for the Nigerian delegation, led by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Silva and which included the Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Engr. Gbenga Komolafe and the Board Secretary and Legal Adviser to the NUPRC, Barrister Olayemi Anyanechi. The team continued to drive conversations around energy transition in a multi-track approach at the various meetings held with top officials of the global energy circuit.\n\nIt argued that instead of a complete abandonment of further development of hydro-carbon infrastructure and phasing out fossil fuel use within the stipulated period, a multi-track approach where gas would be adopted as transition energy source would be fair and just to be pursued, as that was more practicable and sustainable, particularly in respect of developing countries.\n\nSilva explained that Nigeria already has a transition plan which is predicated on a multi-track approach to developing energy resources. One of those is a focused development of the country\u2019s gas resources during which period a diversified economy would be built around technology and other energy sources. That, he stressed, would help a great deal in boosting the country\u2019s revenue levels and sustaining its economy.\n\nDiscussions on the subject were taken from different perspectives, including zeroing-in on gas potentials and the implication of continued gas flaring and reinjection. The effect of flaring on the environment and health of the people of oil-bearing communities was specifically highlighted as the team explored concrete ways of ending the menace.\n\nThe point of convergence is the responsible monetization of Nigerian\u2019s gas resources which the American counterparts were in agreement. The US team appreciated the multifaceted approach to curtail emissions proposed by the Nigerian government and made suggestions on innovative ways to develop stranded gas resources in a more responsible manner, some of which include the use of Blue Hydrogen which is obtained when natural gas is split into hydrogen and CO2 either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or Auto Thermal Reforming (ATR). However, the CO2 is captured and stored, which in return mitigates the harsh impact on the environment.\n\nThis the US team suggested would be a good way for Nigeria to utilize its abundant Natural gas resources of over 200 trillion cubic feet (TCF).\n\nDuring one of the several meetings which involved the US Secretary of State for Energy, Jennifer M. Granholm, and a second which involved Honourable Harry Kamian, Assistant Secretary of State for the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Energy Resources, the United States Government showed interest in collaborating with the Nigerian government to develop the country\u2019s gas resources, recognising that Africa may indeed need to be given separate recognition, as long as development of natural gas hastens the net-zero emissions target of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the world at large.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. DOE promised to support Nigeria with development partners to put through the framework for the development of its gas resources\n\nRiding on the optimism of the meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State for Energy, the the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) team met with Brendan Kelly of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Puneet Sharma of CyanNH3 to discuss extensive methane abatement opportunities in Nigeria, in partnership with the United States government, especially in the area of conversion of gas to ammonia, for use either as fertiliser or for export.\n\nThe team highlighted the fact that the proposed EU Carbon Border Tax would put severe financial pressure on the use of LPFO and HPFO by vessels and provide a renewed impetus for producers around the world to accelerate efforts to slash their carbon footprints, thus creating a massive opportunity for the use of ammonia as the fuel of choice.\n\nIn response, the US team promised to collaborate with the Nigerian government by funding a study to evaluate the viability of making Nigeria an Ammonia net export nation from the 218 flare sites which flare an average of 0.7 Billion cubic feet (BCF) of gas daily, with skid mounted innovative ammonia production equipment\u2019s and other virtual pipeline development devices.\n\nMoreover, the US Department of State and Department of Trade agreed to collaborate with Nigeria by working together with development partners to fund a study to mature these initiatives into full gas commercialization and convert the waste into a source of federation revenue generation, while eliminating the environmental degradation.\n\nFinally, the successful take off of the project will not only open another massive revenue stream for the country but would tackle the challenges of environmental pollution and the resultant health challenges visited on the people of oil producing communities, as a result of gas flaring. In essence, the success of ongoing discussions with the U.S. government and proposed development partners will not only arrest environmental degradation and guarantee the health of the people, it also has the potential to generate much needed foreign exchange for the country.\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",
