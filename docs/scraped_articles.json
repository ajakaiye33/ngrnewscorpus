          "text": ".\n\nIt\u2019s not Christlike to kill innocent people \u2013 Fani-Kayode condemns killings of Muslim Fulani in Plateau\n\n\u201cYou target a group of innocent and defenceless Hausa Fulani Muslims who were on their way home after worshipping their God and you slaughter them like Sallah rams.\n\nYour defence is that these were reprisal killings for the slaughter of your Christian brothers and kinsmen by a group of Fulanis at an earlier date.\n\nMy questions for you and those that are egging you on and clapping for you are as follows:\n\n1. Were those innocent travellers you butchered part of those that killed your Christian brothers and kinsmen at the said earlier date?\n\n2. Do two wrongs make a right?\n\n3. Is it the Christian way to target innocent and defenceless people who have done you no wrong and who present no threat and subject them to mass murder, ethnic cleansing and genocide?\n\nI have condemned the targeting and mass murder of Christians by Muslims consistently over the years and I have expressed outrage about this every time it happens.\n\nAm I supposed to keep quiet and relish it when it happens the other way around and when Christians murder Muslims simply because I am a Christian?\n\nAre we not all human beings with blood flowing through our veins and are these people not our compatriots?\n\nThere is no reason on earth why I would not condemn the mass murder of Muslims by Christians as well and anyone that expects me to keep quiet and not wholeheartedly condemn it when such barbarity is visited upon any of my compatriots does not know FFK.\n\nWe must stop behaving like animals and start acting like human beings in this country and we must stop killing one another at the drop of a hat for whatever reason.\n\nIf we refuse to do so we will wake up one day and we will not have a country left: the only thing we will have is a massive cauldron of fire in which every single one of us is either consumed or becomes a pitiful and sorry refugee.\n\nNo one wins a religious or tribal war in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural nation of over 210 million people. If God forbid, it were to ever happen we will ALL suffer and we will ALL lose!\n\nI call for peace, calm and restraint on all sides in Plateau state and indeed throughout the country.\n\nMay the souls of those that were killed in Jos two days ago rest in peace and may those that murdered them in cold blood be brought to justice\u201d-\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar has described former military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, as a pillar of unity and a firm believer in one Nigeria as Babangida marked his 80th birthday.\n\nAbubakar said in a statement by his Media Adviser, Mr Paul Ibe, in Abuja on Monday, that Babangida, popularly known as IBB, established an inclusive government that reflected Nigeria\u2019s ethnic and religious diversities.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t deny IBB the credit for his sincere efforts to build a viable federation founded on equitable representation,\u2019\u2019 Abubakar said.\n\nHe noted that even Babangida\u2019s \u201cmost stubborn critics\u2019\u2019 could not deny the fact that the former military leader had built a solid national infrastructure for the country which was still standing and visible around the country.\n\nThe former vice president also paid tribute to IBB for assembling one of the best and most formidable cabinets in Nigeria\u2019s recent history because of his commitment to excellence.\n\nAbubakar commended the former military president\u2019s remarkable childhood history, saying that the general lost both his parents at an early age and had to struggle to pull himself up in life.\n\nHe described IBB as a man of vast knowledge, wisdom, a wealth of experience and a broad outlook on life.\n\nHe prayed to Allah to grant him more years in good health and vitality.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Education is vital to human development and the nation as a whole,\u201d he noted in a chat with DAILY POST.\n\n\u201cOne will frankly advise the IPOB to halt the protest for the students to sit for 2021 WASSCE, especially the basic subjects without which admission to tertiary institutions may be impossible.\n\n\u201cThe Nnamdi Kanu I know won\u2019t have supported such an idea that would jeopardize the educational progress of hundreds of thousands of students in the South East, this will be counterproductive. The other aspect of it is that this protest might stall the early release of Nnamdi Kanu from detention.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to release him without trial, but if the government is forced to commence trial, it will not be in Kanu\u2019s interest. We as a group will therefore urge IPOB to suspend the protest given the adverse effect on students from the Southeast region.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification whatsoever to continue the sit-at-home protest to the detriment of our students who may eventually be deprived of gaining admission to tertiary institutions.\n\n\u201cThe best thing that is very reasonable to do is to immediately review the protest and allow our students to sit for the examination they registered for.\n\n\u201cHistory and posterity may not forgive if nothing was done to ensure that our students move along with others in the country.\u201d\n\nBiafra: We\u2019re not compromised, didn\u2019t receive money from govt \u2013 Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s family",

          "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 Thousands of people packed into the Afghan capital\u2019s airport on Monday, rushing the tarmac and pushing onto planes in desperate attempts to flee the country after the Taliban overthrew the Western-backed government. U.S. troops fired warning shots as they struggled to manage the chaotic evacuation.\n\nThe Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, bringing a stunning end to a two-decade campaign in which the U.S. and its allies had tried to transform Afghanistan. The country\u2019s Western-trained security forces collapsed or fled in the face of an insurgent offensive that tore through the country in just over a week, ahead of the planned withdrawal of the last American troops at the end of the month.\n\nIn the capital, a tense calm set in, with most people hiding in their homes as the Taliban deployed fighters at major intersections. There were scattered reports of looting and armed men knocking on doors and gates, and there was less traffic than usual on eerily quiet streets. Fighters could be seen searching vehicles at one of the city\u2019s main squares.\n\nMany fear chaos, after the Taliban freed thousands of prisoners and the police simply melted away, or a return to the kind of brutal rule the Taliban imposed when it was last in power. They raced to Kabul\u2019s international airport, where the \u201ccivilian side\u201d was closed until further notice, according to Afghanistan\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority. The military was put in control of the airspace.\n\nVideos circulating on social media showed hundreds of people running across the tarmac as U.S. soldiers fired warning shots in the air. One showed a crowd pushing and shoving its way up a staircase, trying to board a plane, with some people hanging off the railings.\n\nIn another video, hundreds of people could be seen running alongside a U.S. Air Force transport plane as it moved down a runway. Some climbed onto the side of the jet just before takeoff. That raised questions about how much longer aircraft would be able to safely take off and land.\n\nMassouma Tajik, a 22-year-old data analyst, described scenes of panic at the airport, where she was hoping to board an evacuation flight.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nCatholic Bishops, under the Kaduna Ecclesiastical Province, have bemoaned worsening insecurity in the country, saying deaths in the hands of kidnappers, killer herdsmen, bandits and terrorist groups have made Nigeria the most terrorised country in the world.\n\nThe clerics blamed Nigerian leaders and northern governors for not doing enough to stem the spate of attacks and killings of innocent persons.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by Archbishop of Kaduna, Matthew Man-Oso Ndagoso and Archbishop of Kaduna Ecclesiastical Province, John Namaza Niyiring, the clerics accused northern governors of formulating policies and programmes geared towards one particular religion, a trend they alleged was responsible for attacks on Christian faithful in the North.\n\n\u201cChurch leaders have been kidnapped, tortured and in some cases, gruesomely murdered for no reason other than that they bear the Cross of Christ.\u201d\n\nThey said current cases of killings of innocent citizens was akin to the civil war that spanned 1967 to 1970, saying the country is at war with enemies hiding under religion to perpetrate evils even as they declared a week of prayer and fasting for peace to return to the land.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators of these evils are constantly appealing to the religion of Islam to validate their criminality. The actions of some of our governors in the past and even present have opened up windows that are being exploited by these evil men in the name of religion. We, therefore, call on our governors to become more circumspect in the policies that are being enunciated regarding religion.\u201d\n\nThe bishops described the last few years as the most trying times in the history of the country, saying a culture of self-doubt and uncertainty have bred fear, anxiety and deep suspicion among the people.\n\n\u201cExcept for the civil war, our nation has never witnessed the kind of wide spread macabre, evil, wanton destruction and murderous blood-letting. Life has never been so cheap, nor has Nigeria ever been at the stage we are in now. Deaths in the hands of kidnappers, killer herdsmen, bandit, terrorist groups have made Nigeria the most terrorised country in the world. We are now one of the most dangerous places to be born. Everywhere you turn, funerals have become our daily menu. The abductions of schoolchildren have presented us with the prospects of a traumatised generation of young students. Even at the best of times, our region has been behind in almost every index of human survival.\n\n\u201cIt is important for us all to understand the northern states have been the most affected in this tragedies, loss of human lives and horror that has engulfed our nation. Adequate consultations should be undertaken with all religious leaders and the wider society because our plural societies demand nothing less if laws are to be for the good of all.\n\n\u201cThe actions of some of our governors in the past and even present have opened up windows that are being exploited by these men of evil in the name of religion. We are ready to support our governors to see an end to these tragedies. However, our laws must be anchored on the principles of democracy and national cohesion.\n\n\u201cWe have declared a week of prayer and fasting for peace in our land from August 15 to 22, 2021. The week of prayer will be formally declared open by the Bishop and will include rosary procession and benediction in our churches.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Archbishop of Abuja Catholic Archdiocese, Ignatius Kaigama, has said only urgent help from heaven can save Nigeria and keep it from imminent collapse.\n\nKaigama, in his homily at Church of Annunciation, Kubwa, Abuja, made reference to all indices which point to the fact that Nigeria is on failure path with the state and its governance system seriously threatened.\n\n\u201cWe need urgent divine help for our nation, our families, and especially, our unemployed young people suffering deprivation and losing confidence in self-seeking political leaders to give them what it takes to survive in their fatherland.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s intervention is urgently needed because of prevailing corruption, bloodshed and violence. Also, apart from so many youths having no jobs, some of our children are in the wicked hands of terrorists and bandits in the bush subjected to emotional and social deprivation.\u201d",

          "text": "Billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola, has applauded former military president, General Ibrahim Babangida, for the role he played during the political logjam caused by the prolonged sickness of President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua in 2010.\n\nFelicitating with the former military president, also known as IBB, who marks his 80th birthday last Tuesday, Otedola, in his forthcoming book on business lessons, scheduled for release in November, revealed how IBB sent him to tell then former vice president, Goodluck Jonathan, to sit on the empty seat of then president in the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua failing to formally transfer power to his deputy when he was flown abroad for medical treatment, there was tension across the nation as a result of the power vacuum, which led to public protests.\n\nWriting on the need for entrepreneurs to engage with political authorities in one of the chapters, Otedola maintains that such a relationship will benefit the country.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs\u2019 outreach and dialogue with political leaders, among many positives, will ensure stability and social coherence, guaranteeing economic progress.\n\n\u201cWorried by the tension and uncertainty, I decided to do something on my own,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIn the first week of February 2010, I went to Minna, Niger State, along with Hajia Bola Shagaya, to commiserate with General Babangida over the death of his wife, Maryam.\n\n\u201cAt his Hilltop residence, we spoke on a wide range of issues but I told him I needed to discuss an urgent and vital issue. He took me to his study, where the two of us were alone. I told him the state of the nation had been agitating my mind.\n\n\u201cI asked Babangida how can we get out of this logjam that the political heat is too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm and resolute, IBB replied: \u2018Femi, advise your friend that when he gets to the council chambers next week for the FEC meeting, he should go and sit on the president\u2019s chair\u2019. I found that fascinating and assured him I would pass the message across. I travelled back to Abuja by road in the evening and went straight to have dinner with Jonathan. I did not waste time in delivering Babangida\u2019s message to him. He nodded and asked me: \u2018What do you think?\u2019 I laughed and said, \u2018Be a man, Your Excellency. Go and sit on that chair\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe looked at me for some time and responded that he would think about it. A week later, on Tuesday, February 9, the National Assembly adopted the famous \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019 to make Jonathan acting president pending the return of Yar\u2019Adua from his medical leave. Behind-the-scene moves by prominent Nigerians preceded this decision. The legislative resolution was unprecedented but the nation had been tensed up. The fault lines were so stoked that an unusual solution was needed to address the unique situation.\n\n\u201cWith Jonathan now legally empowered to act as president, there remained the critical optics: would he stand-in for the president confidently and authoritatively? Or would he try to maintain a subdued outlook? The following day was the FEC meeting.\n\n\u201cAs Jonathan entered the council chamber, he made to sit on the chair of the vice president, his usual seat. As the protocol officer pulled out the chair, Jonathan marched towards the seat reserved for the president. And he sat on it.\n\n\u201cThat was the moment Jonathan took control of power. By that act, he sent a strong signal to all Nigerians that he was now in charge. The same day, Jonathan even reshuffled the cabinet.\u201d\n\nYar\u2019Adua died on May 5, 2010, and Jonathan was sworn in as his replacement, going on to win the 2011 presidential elections and serving one term in office.\n\nIn the book, Otedola said entrepreneurs must engage with political authorities because it is only when there is peace that the economy can boom.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Buhari Under Pressure To Remove Governor Buni As APC Party Chairman Amid Multi-billion Naira Asset Declaration Scandal",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is under intense pressure to remove the Governor of Yobe state, Mai Mala Buni as the Chairnan of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nThe legality of the Buni-led committee was recently called to question by some Justices of the Supreme Court in determining an election matter brought by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the last Ondo governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, challenging the election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu.\n\nThough the majority of the jurists okayed the governor\u2019s second term in office, the panel did not spare the rod on the leadership of the APC under Buni, describing the Yobe governor\u2019s holding of the party\u2019s helms as illegal.\n\nA Presidential source told SaharaReporters that pressure is being mounted on Buhari to call for the Yobe state governor's removal as the party\u2019s chairman.\n\nThe President who returned from United Kingdom last Friday is expected to hold separate meetings with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami and some APC governors during the week.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) is clear and unambiguous to the effect that a Governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.\n\n\u201cSome lawyers have advised the President to let Buni go. Like Festus Keyamo (Minister of State for Labour and Employment) opined, the NEC (National Executive Council) of the party can urgently meet, consider and reconstitute the CECPC to exclude, not only Governor Buni, but anyone holding any executive position in any government establishment as stipulated in Article 17 of the APC Constitution,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nThis comes amid spirited efforts by Buni and his supporters to cover up a multi-billion naira asset declaration scandal he is involved in. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: National Chairman Of Buhari's APC Party, Governor Buni In Multi-billion Naira Asset Declaration Scandal\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Buni, who was the National Secretary of the APC until his election as Yobe state governor in 2019, was involved in anticipatory declaration, a criminal offence under the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) law.\n\n\u201cThough he has immunity but he committed offences contrary to Section 15 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C15 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 which are punishable under Section 23 (2) of the same Act,\u201d a Government House source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the document submitted by Buni showed he declared having N2 billion as cash in 11 Nigerian banks.\n\n\n\nFurther checks showed that the accounts are being operated by one firm, MDG Construction and General Company Limited.\n\n\n\nBuni, in the document however claimed to have no cash in foreign accounts.\n\n\n\nDespite claiming his two main sources of income were farming and business, a closer look at the document revealed that the governor declared 25 buildings in Abuja, Kano, Borno, Kaduna and Yobe states valued at N3.1 billion.\n\n\n\nAlso, Buni declared that he has six farms valued at N591 million in Abuja and Yobe states.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the APC National Caretaker Chairman declared that he has three filling stations valued at N425 million.\n\nDisbelief is trailing the governor\u2019s claim that he earns N42 million from a farm worth N7 million in Damaturu in the face of Boko Haram insurgency.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is under intense pressure to remove the Governor of Yobe state, Mai Mala Buni as the Chairnan of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nThe legality of the Buni-led committee was recently called to question by some Justices of the Supreme Court in determining an election matter brought by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the last Ondo governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, challenging the election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu.\n\nThough the majority of the jurists okayed the governor\u2019s second term in office, the panel did not spare the rod on the leadership of the APC under Buni, describing the Yobe governor\u2019s holding of the party\u2019s helms as illegal.\n\nA Presidential source told SaharaReporters that pressure is being mounted on Buhari to call for the Yobe state governor's removal as the party\u2019s chairman.\n\nThe President who returned from United Kingdom last Friday is expected to hold separate meetings with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami and some APC governors during the week.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) is clear and unambiguous to the effect that a Governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.\n\n\u201cSome lawyers have advised the President to let Buni go. Like Festus Keyamo (Minister of State for Labour and Employment) opined, the NEC (National Executive Council) of the party can urgently meet, consider and reconstitute the CECPC to exclude, not only Governor Buni, but anyone holding any executive position in any government establishment as stipulated in Article 17 of the APC Constitution,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nThis comes amid spirited efforts by Buni and his supporters to cover up a multi-billion naira asset declaration scandal he is involved in. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: National Chairman Of Buhari's APC Party, Governor Buni In Multi-billion Naira Asset Declaration Scandal\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Buni, who was the National Secretary of the APC until his election as Yobe state governor in 2019, was involved in anticipatory declaration, a criminal offence under the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) law.\n\n\u201cThough he has immunity but he committed offences contrary to Section 15 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C15 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 which are punishable under Section 23 (2) of the same Act,\u201d a Government House source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the document submitted by Buni showed he declared having N2 billion as cash in 11 Nigerian banks.\n\n\n\nFurther checks showed that the accounts are being operated by one firm, MDG Construction and General Company Limited.\n\n\n\nBuni, in the document however claimed to have no cash in foreign accounts.\n\n\n\nDespite claiming his two main sources of income were farming and business, a closer look at the document revealed that the governor declared 25 buildings in Abuja, Kano, Borno, Kaduna and Yobe states valued at N3.1 billion.\n\n\n\nAlso, Buni declared that he has six farms valued at N591 million in Abuja and Yobe states.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the APC National Caretaker Chairman declared that he has three filling stations valued at N425 million.\n\nDisbelief is trailing the governor\u2019s claim that he earns N42 million from a farm worth N7 million in Damaturu in the face of Boko Haram insurgency. Three of his cars he claimed are also worth N58.5 million.\n\n\n\nA source at the CCB told SaharaReporters that investigation of the governor\u2019s anticipatory declaration has gone far at the agency.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are doing everything to cover up the scandal up but investigation is really ongoing.

          "text": "A United Kingdom-based Nigerian businessman, Romeo Ozoagu, has accused his brother in-law, Ignatius Okonkwo of killing his sister, Eucharia Okonkwo (the accused person's wife).\n\nRomeo claimed that without proper investigation, the police freed Ignatius after arresting and detaining him over the death of his wife.\n\nHe also expressed dissatisfaction with the manner by which the police handled the investigation into the death of the deceased.\n\nIgnatius, a resident of Sixth Avenue, FESTAC Town in the Amuwo-Odofin Local Government Area of Lagos State, had reportedly called Romeo on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, to inform him without further explanation, that his 55-year-old sister had died.\n\nRomeo said after the call, he then called his cousin, Ezenwa, and his younger brother Hillary, to visit his sister's house but Ignatius did not allow them to see her remains.\n\nIgnatius also allegedly failed to take her relations to the mortuary where he had deposited her remains to see her.\n\n\u201cMy brother-in-law, Mr Ignatius Okonkwo, who lives on Sixth Avenue, FESTAC, Lagos, called me around 7.03am on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, to inform me that my sister, Eucharia Okonkwo, was dead. I live in London. I had spoken to my sister three days before that day. I immediately called my younger brother, Hillary Ozoagu, and cousin, Ezenwa, to visit my sister\u2019s house to verify the information, because I was still in shock. On Thursday, they met Ignatius to find out what really happened.\n\n\u201cHe told them that it rained heavily overnight and he went to his wife\u2019s room to check if the windows were closed. The people I sent requested that he take them to the mortuary, where the corpse was deposited, but he refused. I then instructed my brother to report the case at the FESTAC Police Station.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that before the policemen got to his house, Ignatius had fled.\n\nThe case was then reported to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti, in Yaba.\n\nBut he was nowhere to be found when policemen from there visited his home.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe FESTAC Divisional Polive Officer arranged for some policemen to go to Ignatius\u2019 house and get him arrested. On their way, one of the police officers, who is his close friend, sent him a text message that he should escape by scaling the fence. After this, my brother reported the case at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Panti, Yaba.\n\n\u201cWhen officers from Panti came to the place to arrest him, he had locked his gate and switched off his phone. He was nowhere to be found for 22 days. We paid the police to track him; his first location was in Ogun State and later Enugu State. Policemen at Panti were not as helpful as they wanted us to provide logistics, including vehicles, to apprehend him in Enugu.\n\n\u201cHe was advised at Enugu to return to Lagos and meet with Hillary, my brother, so that they could go to the mortuary and see my sister\u2019s corpse. He called Hilary and apologised for initially fleeing. Hillary invited him to his house in a bid to settle the matter and alerted the police of the arrangement. That was how he was arrested.\u201d\n\nRomeo added that he saw the suspect in police custody when he came to Nigeria on May 27, but that Ignatius was released on the same day and was rearrested and taken into custody on June 15.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI arrived in Nigeria and went to the police on May 27 to see the suspect and demanded an autopsy to determine the cause of my sister\u2019s death. The police said I couldn\u2019t make that kind of demand. Meanwhile, we were unaware that Ignatius had been secretly released from Panti. One of the things that surprised me was that my sister\u2019s doctor, Declan Nwaigwe, who pronounced her dead on the day he visited the house, said she had been dead for 48 hours before he got there, meaning that my sister died on Sunday, April 25, 2021.\n\n\u201cOne of my sisters at FESTAC saw Ignatius in the neighbourhood and called me to ask if the case was over. I told her that nothing of such had happened and that he was supposed to be in police custody. He was rearrested on June 15.\u201d\n\nThe 59-year-old businessman said the case was eventually transferred to the Zone 2 Police Command, Onikan, Lagos, on May 15 at the request of his lawyer, but things became more complex when the police demanded that he should pay all the mortuary, transportation and autopsy bills before an investigation into the matter could be concluded.\n\nHe, however, said he declined the request, adding that the deceased\u2019s husband should bear the mortuary cost since he deposited the corpse there.\n\nRomeo stated, \u201cI asked the police to tell Ignatius to pay for keeping the corpse in the mortuary. I even offered to split other bills with him, but he refused. He said I must pay the entire bills because I was the one who brought the case to the police and that he would only pay the mortuary bill if I agreed that the corpse would be buried without an autopsy.\n\n\u201cThe police were also telling me to settle all the bills if I wanted an investigation into the case, because the government didn\u2019t have resources for such. They are frustrating me. The police have refused to investigate the case or charge the suspect. I need all the help I can get.\u201d",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Nigerians\u2019 persistent pension withdrawal mirrors rising unemployment",
          "text": "The trend of Nigerians increasingly tapping their pensions prematurely is yet another indication of the unemployment crisis in a country with the second-highest jobless rate globally.\n\nNearly 50 percent of the total pension contributed by Nigerians in the last five years was withdrawn in the same period.\n\nThe spike in pension withdrawals is coming at a time when the country\u2019s unemployment rate jumped to a 13-year high in 2020. With jobs fading, Nigerians are having to fall back on pensions meant to serve them after retirement.\n\nOut of the N699 billion reported by Agusto & Co.\u2019s newly released 2021 Pension Industry report as the annual average pension contribution recorded in the last five years, 48.78 percent or N341 billion of the total contribution was reported as withdrawals.\n\nWhile the pension contribution in the review period translated to a net annual value of N347 billion, it only accounted for 26.6 percent of the industry\u2019s asset under management (AuM) growth. The remaining 73.4 percent of average growth was attributable to investment returns earned on the portfolios.\n\n\u201cThe growth in the industry\u2019s managed assets has been largely driven by investment returns and additional contributions, to a lesser extent,\u201d research analysts at Agusto & Co. said.\n\nWhy Nigerians continue to withdraw from pension accounts\n\nAccording to the principles of the Pension Reform Act (PRA) 2014, a Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holder who is less than 50 years of age and has not been in any form of paid/gainful employment for a minimum period of four months after formal exit from employment is qualified to apply for 25 percent of the balance in his/her RSA in line with the Regulations for the Administration of Retirement and Terminal Benefits.\n\nUnemployment in Africa\u2019s most populous nation rose to its highest in over a decade and the world\u2019s second-highest in 2020. This mirrors the fragile state of Nigeria\u2019s economic progress\n\nEconomic growth in Africa\u2019s top crude producing nation averaged 1.2 percent between 2015 and 2019. The problem with that is the population grew two times faster at an average of 2.6 percent per year.\n\nRead also: Do Nigerians really have money in Pension?\n\nSince 2017, when oil-dependent Nigeria emerged from its first economic recession in five years (exited its second in 2020), not only has the country\u2019s economic growth been sluggish but only a few sectors triggered the expansion, further undermining the country\u2019s capacity to create enough jobs to meet the growing number of labour market entrants.\n\nWhile the sectors of the Nigerian economy that require less labour have been growing at a pace faster than their peers, the labour-intensive sectors with the potential to reduce the country\u2019s 33.3 percent unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 have either been in recession or growing at a sluggish rate.\n\n\u201cThe sectors with significant growth use very little labour,\u201d the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) said at the sixth Regular Meeting.\n\nA high unemployment rate in a country like Nigeria whose economy is described as one that is stagflated (a blend of high inflation rate and slow economic growth) means poor Nigerians will become poorer in real terms, and the middle class will get thinned out.\n\nBefore COVID-19, about 80 million of Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people were living on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic and population growth could see that figure rise to almost 100 million by 2023, notes the World Bank.\n\nThreat to retirement plan\n\nIt is unlikely that an unemployed person who is struggling to get by and living on less than $2 a day would have the capacity to save for their retirement.\n\nThis, therefore, put the plans of many Nigerians to take care of themselves and their loved ones in their old age at risk, an issue that implies that the long-existing perception of parents\u2019 dependence on their children to care for them in their old age might not end anytime soon.\n\nFour in every 10 Nigerian parents interviewed in EFInA\u2019s 2020 survey said they depend on their children to meet their needs when they are old and cannot work.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s population is expected to grow by as much as 35 million in the next decade, and unless the pace of growth and job creation accelerates, the country will account for a quarter of all people living in extreme poverty worldwide,\u201d Marco Hernandez, World Bank lead economist for Nigeria, said.",

I am so excited about it. Other clubs should see us as role models and learn from us how to maintain discipline. Our Stadium is we secured nobody have access to the field of play. Fans can only react to poor officiating or any perceived injustice by shouting. Nigerians should know that Football is a game of unity and not the other way round.

What happened here on Monday last week is very sad. Imagine that buses belonging to a transport company, Libra was burnt.\n\n\u201cThe hoodlums stopped the buses which had loaded for Lagos and ordered all the passengers to go down. Three passengers refused, wondering how they can be ordered to stop their journey after they had spent money to buy tickets.

This simply means that all commands from the supreme leader of IPOB will be obeyed and implemented to the latter by the Directorate of State of the Indigenous People of Biafra.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind therefore that this principle has enabled this movement to surpass even the expectations of both Biafrans and non-Biafrans alike, the leadership wishes to encourage Biafran to focus on the most pressing issue confronting this great family presently which is ensuring the safety of our leader while still in the illegal custody of the DSS and to secure his unconditional release from detention.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the directive from our leader, our sit-at-home will in the meantime be observed on the date of our leader\u2019s court appearances.\u201d",

          "text": "By Adebayo Obajemu\n\nThough the 2023 presidential election is still one year and some months away, the fireworks have begun, and politicians have already begun behind the scenes political manoeuvres. One interesting feature of the coming contest for presidency is the reenactment of the old and traditional fault-lines and primordial sentiment that had made ours a prebendal politics.\n\nLast week, Mr. Uche Secondus, chairman of main opposition party, PDP escaped ouster as the two regions battled for the soul of the party in the run up to 2023. Whoever occupies the position will determine where the president comes from.\n\nAfter eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari will have come to a constitutional close in 2023, the North through their body language, utterances of some key politicians, opinion leaders and network of some influential power brokers close to the seat of power, appear not ready to relinquish power and allow same to shift to the South.\n\n\u201cLet me be frank with you, the thinking in critical but powerful circles in the North across political divide is that after Buhari another Northerner should succeed him, before the idea of power shifting to the South could ever be given serious consideration\u201d, says Professor Adeagbo Moritiwon, a political scientist in a telephone conversation with Business Hallmark.\n\nHe contended that having spent 13 years in power, it is widely believed in the North that Buhari and Yar\u2019dua terms put together have not approximated the 13 years of Southern presidency.\n\nGiving credence to this line of thought, Professor David Fiki of the Ahmadu Bello University told this newspaper that \u201cNorth understands Politics and are more adept at the game than Southerners, it is not as if the North is opposed to the idea of presidency moving to the South, but the North believes that they are yet to complete their terms. Don\u2019t forget that the strand of northern conservatives in power now is the most parochial and fundamentalist when it comes to northern interest.\u201d\n\nAs it is the North is calculating politically, and the strategy is to push the politics of the two major political parties to a cul de sac that will effectively position the region to benefit from whichever side the political pendulum swings.\n\nAs the North strategizes to secure presidency come 2023, political expediencies demand that sacking Uche Secondus from being chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party may not be in its best interest, since replacing him with a Northerner means automatic ticket for the South to produce the president.\n\nSo saving Secondus was a good script, thus Northern power brokers in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), rallied behind Prince Uche Secondus, the party\u2019s national chairman, and saved him from the coup spearheaded by Governor Nyesom Wike to forcefully remove him from office last week.\n\nReliable sources informed BusinessHallmark that a horse of northern powerbrokers led by Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Senator Walid Jibrin, the chairman of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT) rallied the North behind Secondus for reasons of enlightened self interest.\n\nSources mentioned the presidential ambitions of former vice president, Atiku Abubakar and Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal. Following the upheavals that trailed the resignation of seven members of the Na\u00actional Working Committee (NWC), which included the Deputy National Financial Secretary, the Deputy Legal Adviser, the Deputy National Auditor, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, the Dep\u00acuty Women Leader and the Deputy Organising Secretary, Tambuwal, who is the chair\u00acman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum was said to have ral\u00aclied his colleagues while Ji\u00acbrin also mobilised members of the BoT to do all they could to prevent the party from an imminent implosion.\n\nIt was also gathered that some group of retired gen\u00acerals from the Northern part of the country who played a crucial role in the formation of the party also used their influence to calm the situa\u00action, leading to a temporary ceasefire.\n\nAccording to our source, \u201cBut for the intervention of Northern powerbrokers in the party who quickly mobil\u00acised last week Tuesday, maybe the PDP national chairman would have resigned by now. The motive of those behind the coup plot, led by Governor Nyesom Wike, was to create the impression that Secondus was incapable to lead again as governors defected and NWC members had also passed a vote of no confidence on his leadership.\n\n\u201cHowever, Governor Aminu Tambuwal really lived up to his responsibility as chairman of the PDP Gov-ernors\u2019 Forum. He mobilised his colleagues and I think they were the ones that gave Secon\u00acdus the needed backing that he shouldn\u2019t resign as they were solidly behind him.\n\n\u201cAlso, Senator Jibrin, the chairman of the BoT, also mobilised elders in the par\u00acty against the coup plot. He wondered why some indi\u00acviduals in the party want the NWC dissolved when the BoT passed a vote of confidence on the Secondus-led exco in March, this year, and the Na\u00actional Executive Committee (NEC) also did the same a month later.\n\nBeyond the advantage it confers on the North which will now produce the presidential candidate, many power brokers in the party resent the overwhelming influence of Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State in the party.\n\nSaved by Northern oligarchy, it is believed that Secondus is a political capital that is expected to pay back his being saved from disgrace. Thus after saving him, the stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, then, handed the embattled National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, a two-month life line.\n\nHe would no longer be forced to resign as being canvassed by some members of the National Executive Committee, NEC, National Working Committee, NWC, House of Representatives Caucus, youths and governors.\n\nHowever, instead of December 6, 2021 when his four-year term will end, he has about 80 days to remain in the saddle as the stakeholders have fixed the end of October for the national elective convention of the PDP.\n\nThe stakeholders, comprising 13 governors, the Board of Trustees, BoT and other organs of the party, brought the convention forward in what is seen as a move to placate anti-Secondus forces, who have been pushing for his removal in the past few months.\n\nSeveral groups and individuals, including Southern Governors Forum, influential leaders in the South and regional sociocultural organizations such as PANDEF, Ohaeneze, Afennifere and Middle Belt Forum have all canvassed for the return of power to the South. However, some Northern leaders are saying the idea of Southern presidency is good for the unity of the country.\n\nBorno Governor Zulum backs Southern counterparts for presidency. He disclosed that he is of the view that the presidency should go to the south in the year 2023 because the unity of our country is very important. Zulum disclosed that he is of the view that the presidency should go to the south in the year 2023 because the unity of our country is very important.\n\nGovernor Zulum made this known during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily, noting that his stance was not tied to any political ambition.\n\n\u201cI have said it times without number that I, Professor Babagana Zulum, am of the view that the presidency should go to the south in the year 2023 because the unity of our country is very important.\n\n\u201cAnd I have said it before, I am not interested in becoming vice president or the president of the nation but I want to say the right thing.\n\nRecall that recently eminent leaders, under the aegis of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum, SMBLF, rose from a meeting recently in Abuja demanding 2023 presidential slot to be zoned to the South in the interest of united Nigeria saying without that, there is no Nigeria.\n\nIn its communique signed by Ijaw leader, Chief Edwin Clark; Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere; Prof George Obiozor, President General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide; Dr Pogu Bitrus, National President, Middle Belt Forum and Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien, National Chairman, Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, the forum stated that \u201cthe Northern part of the country would have fully enjoyed the Office of the Presidency, for the full statutory period of eight years by 2023, hence, should yield to the South.\u201d\n\nIt also called on \u201cthe All Progressives Congress, APC, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and other political parties to zone the Presidency in 2023 to the South, at the next election.\u201d\n\nThe group further \u201cenjoined political stakeholders from the South not to be lured into the unpatriotic step of seeking such other positions as national chairmen and Vice President of the main political parties, but join forces to demand and ensure that the Presidency moves to the South in 2023.\u201d\n\nSome northern leaders have however reacted to the demand of their southern counterparts insisting that there was no level of threat or intimidation that would make the political power to return to the South.\n\nThe northern leaders said although they believed the South had competent people, who can be the next president, the leaders of the Southern and Middle belt regions must note that they cannot get the presidential seat by threatening the north with secession.\n\nReacting to the communique by the Southern and Middle belt leaders, a former presidential aide, Alhaji Salisu Yakassai, argued that no region in Nigeria can attain the Presidency without the support of others. Consequently, he advised those who want to be President to hit the road and convince all people that they mean well for them.\n\nHe, however, explained that the politicians and tribal leaders resort to threats because of the fault-lines in Nigeria\u2019s democracy which make votes seem not to count. Yakassai blamed the failure of leadership, especially at the centre, for the decline of nationalism and embrace of parochialism among the people.\n\n\u201cI am a Nigerian to the core, and so, our brothers and sisters all over the country are welcome to air their views, because we are in a democracy.\n\n\u201cHowever, the collective aim should be to build our country. Yes, we are practising democracy and we acknowledge that there are fault lines in it, because votes appear not to count. That in itself creates frustration.\n\n\u201cSo, the demand by the Southern and Middle belt leaders which was capped with a threat may not be far from the frustration that votes do not count in this country. However, it is laughable that politicians and tribal leaders should be making such threats in the 21st century.\n\nWell, even the presidency has said the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable but we say everything is negotiable. But if our brothers in the South and Middle belt regions rather than negotiating are threatening secession, then their demands won\u2019t work.\n\nAnthony Sani, immediate past secretary general of the Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF argued that \u201cthere is no national consensus on politics of identity symbolized by rotation of the Presidency which is binding on political parties.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cpolitics of zoning is still at the level of political parties which use it to design their winning game plans. Even within political parties, we still have party members who insist on their constitutional right to contest and refuse to pander to directives by their political parties and go ahead to contest during party primaries. Multi-party democracy thrives on majority votes and contest of ideas and reasons.\n\n\u201cThe south has ruled for 13 years and the north has ruled for 11 years under the nascent democracy from 1999 to 2023.\n\n\u201cI therefore do not see the basis of hue and cry about where the president comes from in 2023. There is no justification for any insistence that the president must come from the South as condition for the nation to remain one and united.\u201d\n\nMore so the law makes it impossible for the president to emerge in our democracy with the support of one region alone. That is to say, a president must garner not only majority vote but also at least 25 per cent of votes in each of at least 24 of the 36 states. The North does not have 24 states.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, multiparty democracy is expected to unite the country precisely because political parties crisscross the country through campaigns by breaking barriers and building bridges across ethnic, religious and regional aisles. These processes have greater capacity to bring about lasting unity of the nation than politics of fiat zoning.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s rising debt worries World Bank",
          "text": "By Okey Onyeaweaku\n\nDespite the federal government\u2019s effort to downplay the threat of a huge debt challenge hanging heavily on the neck of every citizen of Nigeria, concern has continued to mount and indeed escalated as to prognosis for the future.\n\nThis is even as the World Bank insists that Nigeria\u2019s debt burden is becoming dangerous for her continued economic sustainability.\n\nIn its latest expose on the subject, the Bretton Woods institution specifically categorized Nigeria as being among the 10 countries with relatively very high debt risk exposure.\n\nAccording to the report, Nigeria is ranked fifth on the list with $11.7bn IDA debt stock, while India led the list with $22bn IDA debt stock, followed by Bangladesh with $18.1bn IDA debt stock, Pakistan with $16.4bn IDA debt stock, and Vietnam with $14.1bn IDA debt stock.\n\nEthiopia with $11.2bn IDA debt stock, Kenya with $10.2bn IDA debt stock, Tanzania with $8.3bn IDA debt stock, Ghana with $5.6bn IDA debt stock, and Uganda with $4.4bn IDA debt stock were other countries on the list, according to the financial statement by the International Development Association (IDA), and which is part of the World Bank\u2019s FY21 audited financial statements.\n\nPresident, World Bank Group, David Malpass, said the bank\u2019s support to client countries surged to $157bn over the last 15 months to help address increased poverty and inequality issues as well as the impacts of COVID-19.\n\nMalpass explained that the unprecedented level of commitments helped countries strengthen health systems, protect the poor and vulnerable, support jobs and businesses, promote economic growth, and lay the foundation for green, resilient and inclusive recovery.\n\n\u201cIDA faces two types of credit risk: country credit risk and counterparty credit risk,\u201d the financial statement read.\n\nCountry credit risk according to the report, is the risk of loss due to a country not meeting its contractual obligations; and counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss attributable to a counterparty not honoring its contractual obligations.\n\nThough, the report said it was discovered that Nigeria\u2019s undisbursed balance with the World Bank is about $8.656bn as at June 30, 2021, there have been a consensus that all is not well with the countries debt position.\n\nRecent, report from the National Bureau of Statistics reveal that documented total debt stock of the country stood at $33.6 billion.\n\nWith this level of debt, Nigeria\u2019s debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is 25 per cent far below the international threshold of 58 per cent and leaves huge room for the Federal government to borrow more.\n\nReportedly however, the official debt figures which the Debt Management Office (DMO)released recently did not capture the debts of some states. More disturbing is that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has also lent the government about $25billion (N10trn) through means and ways were also not part of the total debt. In this regard, the one billion naira question in the mouths of many are; how much does Nigeria really owe? What is the implication of the huge debt over hang for the country and future generation? How much does the country spend to service her debt? Can Nigeria get out of the debt trap at the current pace of borrowing?\n\nDiscerning Nigerians had raised alarm even before now that the country\u2019s total debt stock was becoming abnormally huge and could aggravate her already challenging economic status.\n\nHowever, commenting on the uncomfortable debt position of the Country, Chief Executive Officer of HighCap Securities limited, Mr. David Adonri told Business Hallmark in a telephone interview that Nigeria was already in a debt trap.\n\nHe projected that going by current trends, before the end of 2021 the country\u2019s debt stock would rise to $40billion. Adonri who said the present government had made a mess of the economy expressed sadness that over 90 per cent of the nation\u2019s revenue was now deployed to service her huge debt.\n\nAccording to him, the country now almost borrows to service loans and now uses the paltry sum that is left to run the government. He noted that the nation\u2019s debt stock stood at about $35billion while additional loan of about $6billion was recently approved for the government by the national assembly. \u2018We have a huge problem in our hands\u2019, he surmised.\n\nA finance expert who wouldn\u2019t want to be mentioned said Governments tend to take on too much debt because the benefits make them popular with voters. Increasing the debt allows government leaders to increase spending without raising taxes. Investors usually measure the level of risk by comparing debt to a country\u2019s total economic output, known as gross domestic product (GDP). The debt- to -GDP ratio gives an indication of how likely the country can pay off its debt.\n\nSpeaking at another forum yesterday, Former Emir of Kano, decried the deplorable state of the economy,adding that economic achievements of over 35 years have disappeared in the last 6 years due to incompetence and mismanagement of the current leadership.\n\n\u201cYou look at the World Bank economic quality indicators and you will be shocked at what you are seeing. If we take Nigeria\u2019s GDP per capita on a PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) basis, in 1980 it was $2,180 and by 2014, it was $3,099, which increased it by 50 per cent.\n\n\u201cBetween 2014 and 2019, this number fell to $2,229. At this rate, by this year or next year, Nigeria\u2019s GDP per capita on a PPP basis will be back to where it was in 1980.\n\n\u201cWe have not moved. We wiped out in five years all the progress made in the preceding 35 years. That is the kind of conversation we should have which we are not having. And what are the key drivers of this: you\u2019ve got rising population growth, slow GDP growth, higher rates of inflation, and devaluation of the currency,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor decades in this country, we have wasted our resources. Look at the fuel subsidy, which I\u2019ve been talking about since 2011. We take trillions and trillions of naira and tell people we are giving them cheap fuel.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we have bankrupted ourselves. You\u2019ve set up an economic system where today 90 per cent of government revenue goes to debt servicing and we\u2019re still borrowing. We are spending trillions on fuel subsidy. And then we get the Central Bank to print trillions because we cannot pay salaries if we do not print the money. And as the money is printed, we create inflation and then we create devaluation\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\nInformation from the Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that the country\u2019s debt jumped by N20.8tn between July 2015 and December 2020. Total debt stock according DMO stood at N12.12tillion as of June 2015.\n\nThere is a consensus that the country\u2019s rising debt has reached a critical level and might scare investors who have already reduced their exposure to the country.\n\n\u2018\u2019If a country keeps spending, then its bonds may receive a lower S&P rating. This indicates how likely it is that the country will default on its debt\u2019\u2019, said an analyst who would not want to mentioned in print.\n\nThe real sad part of the story is that all things considered, Nigeria may be headed there sooner or later. And that to say the least, is not palatable.",

          "text": "How Nigeria recorded 111 kidnapping cases in eight months\n\nHow Nigeria recorded 111 kidnapping cases in eight months\n\nSince April 2014 after the Boko Haram terrorists abducted 276 schoolgirls from their dormitories in Chibok, Borno State, mass kidnapping for ransom has gradually, become the other of the day in Nigeria.\n\nFindings by Sunday Vanguard show that the country has witnessed staggering 111 kidnapping incidents in the last eight months, that is, from January to mid-August, 2021.\n\nThe total figure represents confirmed cases by the police and eye witnesses\u2019 accounts eventually reported by the media.\n\nSunday Vanguard learned that many other unreported incidents may have taken place, especially in Niger, Zamfara, Sokoto, and Katsina states (North-West and North-Central) where banditry is raging. Thus, the sum total may well be above 111 if all cases were captured.\n\nThe highest number of kidnap cases (27), was recorded in February with 605 victims. This was closely followed by July (23) and January (21) with 327 and 284 victims respectively.\n\nThe situation was made worse due to alleged breakdown of security architecture in the country especially in the North-West and North-East.\n\nSecurity experts say the inability of the Federal Government, through the security agencies, to stem the development has led to a surge in kidnapping and banditry.\n\nAccording to the experts, armed bandits have taken advantage of weak security presence to continue their reign of terror on schools, villages and highways.\n\nSBM Intelligence\n\nAccording to a report by SBM Intelligence, an average of 13 persons were abducted daily in Nigeria in the first half of 2021, thereby underscoring how common and daring the criminals have become.\n\nThe findings, which covered Nigeria\u2019s six geopolitical zones, South-West, South -East, South-South, North-Central, North-East and North-West, and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja, represent the reported cases.\n\nPattern\n\nThe pattern of abduction remained the same in the North, where victims were often kidnapped en mass during attacks on remote villages and schools.\n\nMass abduction of travellers on highways emerged as the latest mode of operation by gunmen who have become more daring.\n\nThis is not prevalent in the North alone as highways in the South-West and South-South have become hot spots.\n\nSome of the dangerous roads identified include Benin-Ore Highway, Benin-Auchi-Okene Highway, Keffi-Akwanga Highway, Akure-Owo Expressway, Abuja-Abaji-Lokoja Road, Zaria-Sokoto-Gusau, Bauchi-Tafawa-Balewa Highway, Wukari-Takum Road and Minna -Kotongora Road.\n\nIn the South-West where herdsmen have been accused of most of the incidents, victims were often abducted on highways and farms.\n\nClear strategy\n\nSunday Vanguard notes that after each mass abduction, state and federal governments condemn the attack in strong terms, with promises to rescue abductees.\n\nWithout any clear strategy for arresting the scourge, which has spread to every part of the country, authorities and individuals pay huge sums to kidnappers.\n\nKidnapping: Fast growing industry\n\nSunday Vanguard investigations also showed that about N11.415 billion was demanded as ransom for kidnapped victims across the country.\n\nKidnapping has become commonplace and a sort of business to bandits and other criminal elements who raid, kill and mass kidnap for ransom, particularly of school children.\n\nIt is a fast growing industry and has remained the most virulent form of banditry in the country.\n\nRecent reports have shown that criminals are often driven by financial motives to kidnap children and others and hold them for ransom.\n\nAttacks on schools\n\nNigeria\u2019s kidnap-for-ransom industry is growing, and it\u2019s not just the well-off who are at risk.\n\nThe new targets are poor villagers and ordinary schoolchildren.\n\nSince the well-publicised abduction in 2014 of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok by Boko Haram terrorists in Borno State, more armed groups have resorted to mass abduction of students.\n\nAuthorities say recent attacks on schools, especially in the North-West, have been carried out by bandits, who are largely motivated by money.\n\nThe timeline below shows how thriving kidnapping has become in Nigerians\n\nAugust 3, 2021: Police kill three kidnappers, rescue commissioner\u2019s wife and driver in Benue\n\nAugust 5, 2021: Bandits kidnap father of Zamfara Assembly Speaker, five others\n\nAugust 9, 2021: Gunmen kidnap Niger Commissioner for Information\n\nAugust 9, 2021: Pastor, wife, 27 others kidnapped in Kwara\n\nAugust 12, 2021: Gunmen abduct ex-councillor\u2019s wife, 7-month-old son in Zamfara\n\nJuly 3, 2021: Bandits abduct 7 women, 4 children along Birnin Gwari Road\n\nJuly 5, 2021: Boko Haram abducts Rev.

          "text": "How Nigeria recorded 111 kidnapping cases in eight months\n\nHow Nigeria recorded 111 kidnapping cases in eight months\n\nSince April 2014 after the Boko Haram terrorists abducted 276 schoolgirls from their dormitories in Chibok, Borno State, mass kidnapping for ransom has gradually, become the other of the day in Nigeria.\n\nFindings by Sunday Vanguard show that the country has witnessed staggering 111 kidnapping incidents in the last eight months, that is, from January to mid-August, 2021.\n\nThe total figure represents confirmed cases by the police and eye witnesses\u2019 accounts eventually reported by the media.\n\nSunday Vanguard learned that many other unreported incidents may have taken place, especially in Niger, Zamfara, Sokoto, and Katsina states (North-West and North-Central) where banditry is raging. Thus, the sum total may well be above 111 if all cases were captured.\n\nThe highest number of kidnap cases (27), was recorded in February with 605 victims. This was closely followed by July (23) and January (21) with 327 and 284 victims respectively.\n\nThe situation was made worse due to alleged breakdown of security architecture in the country especially in the North-West and North-East.\n\nSecurity experts say the inability of the Federal Government, through the security agencies, to stem the development has led to a surge in kidnapping and banditry.\n\nAccording to the experts, armed bandits have taken advantage of weak security presence to continue their reign of terror on schools, villages and highways.\n\nSBM Intelligence\n\nAccording to a report by SBM Intelligence, an average of 13 persons were abducted daily in Nigeria in the first half of 2021, thereby underscoring how common and daring the criminals have become.\n\nThe findings, which covered Nigeria\u2019s six geopolitical zones, South-West, South -East, South-South, North-Central, North-East and North-West, and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja, represent the reported cases.\n\nPattern\n\nThe pattern of abduction remained the same in the North, where victims were often kidnapped en mass during attacks on remote villages and schools.\n\nMass abduction of travellers on highways emerged as the latest mode of operation by gunmen who have become more daring.\n\nThis is not prevalent in the North alone as highways in the South-West and South-South have become hot spots.\n\nSome of the dangerous roads identified include Benin-Ore Highway, Benin-Auchi-Okene Highway, Keffi-Akwanga Highway, Akure-Owo Expressway, Abuja-Abaji-Lokoja Road, Zaria-Sokoto-Gusau, Bauchi-Tafawa-Balewa Highway, Wukari-Takum Road and Minna -Kotongora Road.\n\nIn the South-West where herdsmen have been accused of most of the incidents, victims were often abducted on highways and farms.\n\nClear strategy\n\nSunday Vanguard notes that after each mass abduction, state and federal governments condemn the attack in strong terms, with promises to rescue abductees.\n\nWithout any clear strategy for arresting the scourge, which has spread to every part of the country, authorities and individuals pay huge sums to kidnappers.\n\nKidnapping: Fast growing industry\n\nSunday Vanguard investigations also showed that about N11.415 billion was demanded as ransom for kidnapped victims across the country.\n\nKidnapping has become commonplace and a sort of business to bandits and other criminal elements who raid, kill and mass kidnap for ransom, particularly of school children.\n\nIt is a fast growing industry and has remained the most virulent form of banditry in the country.\n\nRecent reports have shown that criminals are often driven by financial motives to kidnap children and others and hold them for ransom.\n\nAttacks on schools\n\nNigeria\u2019s kidnap-for-ransom industry is growing, and it\u2019s not just the well-off who are at risk.\n\nThe new targets are poor villagers and ordinary schoolchildren.\n\nSince the well-publicised abduction in 2014 of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok by Boko Haram terrorists in Borno State, more armed groups have resorted to mass abduction of students.\n\nAuthorities say recent attacks on schools, especially in the North-West, have been carried out by bandits, who are largely motivated by money.\n\nThe timeline below shows how thriving kidnapping has become in Nigerians\n\nAugust 3, 2021: Police kill three kidnappers, rescue commissioner\u2019s wife and driver in Benue\n\nAugust 5, 2021: Bandits kidnap father of Zamfara Assembly Speaker, five others\n\nAugust 9, 2021: Gunmen kidnap Niger Commissioner for Information\n\nAugust 9, 2021: Pastor, wife, 27 others kidnapped in Kwara\n\nAugust 12, 2021: Gunmen abduct ex-councillor\u2019s wife, 7-month-old son in Zamfara\n\nJuly 3, 2021: Bandits abduct 7 women, 4 children along Birnin Gwari Road\n\nJuly 5, 2021: Boko Haram abducts Rev.

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nZambia\u2019s opposition candidate Hakainde Hichilema has secured a stunning landslide victory over incumbent Edgar Lungu, according to results announced today\n\nThe electoral commission said Hichilema got 2,810,777 votes against Lungu\u2019s 1,814,201, with all but one of the 156 constituencies counted.\n\nEsau Chulu, electoral commission chairman said at Lusaka\u2019s result centre: \u201cI therefore declare that Hichilema to be president of Zambia\u201d.\n\nHichilema, who clinched victory in his sixth attempt, said he would address the media at 12 noon, Zambia\u2019s time.\n\nThis is the third time that power has shifted peacefully from a ruling party to the opposition since Zambia\u2019s independence from Britain in 1964.\n\nAcross Zambia, celebrations broke out in the streets as Hichilema\u2019s supporters wearing the red and yellow of his United Party for National Development (UPND) danced and sang, while drivers honked their horns.\n\nHichilema, 59, a former CEO at an accounting firm before entering politics, now faces the task of reviving Zambia\u2019s fortunes.\n\nThe economy has been buoyed only slightly by more favourable copper prices \u2013 now hovering around decade highs, driven partly by the boom in electric cars.\n\nIn 2020, Zambia, Africa\u2019s second biggest copper miner, produced a record output of the metal.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund support is on hold until after the vote, as is a debt restructuring plan seen as an early test for a new global plan aimed at easing the burden of poor countries.\n\nLungu, 64, has yet to concede defeat, and has indicated that he might challenge the result.\n\nLungu on Saturday alleged that the election was \u201cnot free and fair\u201d after incidents of violence against ruling Patriotic Front Party agents in three provinces.\n\nUPND officials dismissed Lungu\u2019s statement as emanating from people \u201ctrying to throw out the entire election just to cling on to their jobs\u201d.\n\nHichilema, who has described himself as just an ordinary \u201ccattle boy\u201d, has contested and lost every election held in the southern African country since 2006, though he has been buoyed each time by an increased share of the vote.\n\nIn 2016, he unsuccessfully challenged the result of the presidential election, which he said was stolen from him after he narrowly lost by 100,000 votes.\n\nThis time around, the 59-year-old opposition leader latched onto widespread dissatisfaction with Lungu\u2019s running of the economy, campaigning under the slogan \u201cfaka pressure\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cput pressure\u201d for change.\n\nHichilema is no stranger to controversy in the copper-rich nation, having run afoul of the authorities numerous times.\n\nHe regularly mentions that he has been arrested 15 times since getting into politics.",

          "title": "Crumbling terrorists\u2019 dynasty and role of air power -NigPilot",
          "text": "The twin hydra-headed monsters of terrorism and insurgency, as well as other sundry evil dynasties, have slowed the wheel of economic growth and sustainable development in Nigeria for over one decade . These are in addition to human carnage, a threat to food security, unimaginable humanitarian crisis, and humongous destruction of properties, public and private across the theatre of operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest stories emanating from the theatre of operations suggest that the criminal dynasties are speedily crumbling to extinction writes our Defence Correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\nIt was a Russian-American aviation pioneer, inventor, and influential advocate of strategic airpower, Alexander Nikolaievich Prokofiev de Seversky who posited that \u201cOnly air power can defeat airpower. The actual elimination or even stalemating of an attacking Air Force can be achieved only by a superior Air Force\u201d.\n\nRegrettably, the alleged infighting, rivalries, and lack of synergy amongst the tri-services and other security agencies in Nigeria, especially during the long tenure of the former Service Chiefs have no doubt slowed the defeat of Boko Haram, Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists and other adversaries of the state longer than necessary, even with the employment of airpower.\n\nReports of ragtag terrorists overrunning communities and military formations in the northeast theatre and carting away weapons including gun trucks from troops were sad commentaries in the history of unconventional warfare, that the Nigerian state and by extension the Nigerian military have wagged in the Northeast.\n\nOther issues that slowed down the speedy end to the counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in the country included but were not limited to the low morale of troops, orchestrated by poor remuneration, use of old fashioned and obsolete weapons to fight terrorists with sophisticated armaments, and war fatigue on the part of troops due to their staying longer than the stipulated period in the frontline.\n\nVideo of soldiers complaining of the above-enumerated factors still populate the nation\u2019s cyberspace and social media platforms. It is on record that Major General Olusegun Adeniyi openly complained about these in a viral video while serving in the northeast as the Theatre Commander.\n\nThen comes the issues of incessant military air mishaps that left so many countrymen shocked and dumbfounded, even as some critics found humor in the tragic situation and compared the horrific episodes to ripped oranges falling freely from its tree.\n\nHowever, while the nation awaits the day that government will declassify the investigative reports of these perennial crashes that consumed lives of top military brass, including a serving Chief of Army Staff (COAS), to know if the tragedies were caused by a mechanical fault, human error or natural occurrence, it is also imperative to look at some of the factors that led to the incapacitation of the terrorist dynasty.\n\nNevertheless, it was at the burial of the seven Air Force personnel that died in the crashed Beechcraft King Air B350i on February 21, while laboring to secure the release of the staff and students abducted from the Government Science College Kagara, Niger State, that the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao vowed to deal with the criminal elements.\n\nHe noted that the death of the officers and airmen ought to spur the rest of Nigerians to relentlessly expose and fight crimes.\n\n\u201cWe must throw everything that we have into this fight to ensure that our departed colleagues did not die in vain,\u201d he threatened.\n\nThe CAS who almost submitted to tears in grief, said, \u201cI stand here today bearing my personal grief as well as the entire NAF and the country as we lay to rest the remains of our fallen colleagues while in active duty to the Service of their fatherland.\n\n\u201cI must confess that even at this moment, NAF is still in palpable shock and grieving very deeply upon this loss of our gallant and courageous heroes\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cTheir death is a huge loss to the NAF family and indeed the entire nation. They will be greatly missed but fondly remembered for their invaluable services to the nation and humanity\u201d.\n\nJust last week, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), in its bi-weekly briefing on military operations across the federation disclosed that no fewer than one thousand (1000) Boko Haram and Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists laid down their arms and surrendered to the state forces alongside their families.\n\nWhat this new development presupposes is the fact that the nation\u2019s military and by extension the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) is making truth the threat by the CAS that the sacrifices of the fallen heroes can not be in vain and therefore had spurred them to shatter the foundation of terrorism and insurgency in Nigeria.\n\nThe Acting Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who shared the testimony of how the terrorists\u2019 empire is crumbling, while briefing Defence correspondents, also disclosed that no fewer than one hundred and fifty-six (156) criminal elements including terrorists and bandits were killed within the same period.\n\nWhile disclosing that eighty-nine (89) livestock were intercepted from cattle rustlers, the Acting Director also revealed that no fewer than thirty-three (33) kidnaped victims were rescued by the troops within the period under review.\n\nGeneral Onyeuko said that various kinetic operations were carried out to deny terrorists, armed bandits, and other criminal elements freedom of action as well as the frustrate movement of arms and other illegal items in all theatres of operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Headquarters of Operation HADIN KAI has intensified its operations in the North East theatre. The intensity of these operations has yielded tremendous results as evidenced in the number of casualties and massive surrender of terrorists in Buni Yari, Gorgore, Baga, and Monguno Towns as well as Maiduguri \u2013 Baga Road, Maiduguri \u2013 Damboa Road, and Bula Yobe \u2013 Darel Jamel Road. Operations were also carried out at Kayamri and Mairari villages as well as Monguno and Kukawa Towns, all in Borno State.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, the operations led to the neutralization of 27 BHT/ISWAP fighters, arrest of 51 BHT/ISWAP terrorists, 3 terrorists\u2019 collaborators as well as recovery of 35 assorted arms and 1,051 round of ammunition including AK-47 and FN rifles, Dushka anti-aircraft guns, GPMG, PKT guns, 60mm mortar tubes, Makarov pistol and other machine guns, amongst other items. In addition, 29 abducted civilians were rescued within the period under review. Gentlemen no fewer than 1,000 terrorists and their families comprising adult females and children surrendered to their own troops at different locations in the North East. Notable among them is the notorious BHT bomb expert named, Musa Adamu aka Mala Musa Abuja, and his deputy, Usman Adamu aka Abu Darda. This has in no small measure depleted the BHT fighting force\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Borno State Governor, Babagana Umara Zulum, on Saturday last week in Gwoza, received another Chibok Girl who presented herself to the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe schoolgirl, Hassana Adamu, alongside her two children, was handed over to Governor Zulum by the Commander, 26 Taskforce Brigade, Brigadier General DR Dantani.\n\nHassana was one of over 200 schoolgirls abducted at a Government Secondary School in Chibok on April 14, 2014, by Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nRecall that Ruth Ngladar Pogu and a man said to be her husband had earlier presented themselves to the Nigerian Army on July 28, 2021, at a location in Bama.\n\nThese and many more are clear indications that the terrorism and insurgency dynasties are not only crumbling to the ashes but the needed peace that would user in prosperity and food security is knocking hard on the doorsteps of residents of North-East who had abandoned their ancestral homes and taken refuge in makeshift IDP camps where hunger and fear were their known companion.\n\nThe above advancement to the gate of hope of an end to terrorism in Nigeria is not unconnected with combined air and artillery bombardment of terrorist enclaves and armory, as well as a huge investment in the procurement of platforms and capacity building of manpower to intensifies employment of airpower.\n\nSupporting the earlier quote on the imperative of airpower in fighting all kinds of war, the United Kingdom wartime leader, Sir Winston Churchill, averred that, \u201cThe Navy can lose us the war, but only the Air Force can win it. The fighters are our salvation, but the bombers alone provide the means of victory\u201d.\n\nAlso giving credence and legitimacy to the above proposition, an American journalist, author, and critic of United States foreign policy, William Henry Blum said: \u201cA terrorist is someone who has a bomb, but doesn\u2019t have an Air Force\u201d.\n\nHowever, the cheering news of the decapitation of terrorist groups by the combined artillery and air bombardment is not unconnected with huge investment in the procurement of modern armaments and training of personnel by the incumbent administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIt is on record that the NAF recently conducted a holistic assessment of its combat efficiency in order to determine requirements, in terms of air platforms, armament, communication, manpower, and medical, amongst others, to raise the efficiency of the Service to appropriate levels to meet current and emerging national security imperatives.\n\nTo feel the identified gap, available statistics reveal that in the last six (6) years, the incumbent administration acquired 26 brand new aircraft to boost the combat readiness of the NAF.\n\nThe data further disclosed that the newly acquired aircraft include ten (10) Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, five (5) new Mi-35M helicopter gunships, and two (2) Bell 412 helicopters.\n\nOthers include four (4) Agusta 109 Power attack helicopters, two (2) Mi-171E helicopters, and more recently, three (3) JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter aircraft.\n\n\u201cOn 30th August 2021, we would witness the induction of six (6) A-29 Super Tucano aircraft out of the twelve (12) already purchased by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. It is expected that the remaining six (6) A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, as well as some Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles which will arrive the country before the end of the year, will boost NAF\u2019s air power employment capabilities in support of joint operations.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, through the unwavering support of President Buhari, twenty (20) previously grounded aircraft including the Falcon 900, ATR-42, Beechcraft, Super Puma, F-7Ni, EC-135, Do-228, Mi-24V, Mi-35P, C-130H, L-39ZA, and Alpha Jet aircraft have been reactivated. Additionally, for the first time in its history, the NAF successfully conducted multiple in-country Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM) on two (2) C-130H, 3 L-39ZA aircraft, 2 Mi-35P helicopters as well as three (3) Alpha Jet aircraft,\u201d the information posited.\n\nAlso, the acquisitions and reactivation as well as the emplacement of robust logistics support structure have enabled the NAF to raise the serviceability status of operable aircraft from about 35 percent in 2015 to about 72% as of 2 August 2021.\n\nOther military source shows that to ensure the sustainability of the newly acquired platforms, the Federal Government in the last six (6) years invested substantially in the training and retraining of NAF personnel both locally and abroad.\n\n\u201cThe NAF has winged over 133 pilots while 233 other personnel of various trades are currently undergoing training. Similarly, the enhancement of training facilities at the 401 Flying Training School (401 FTS) Kaduna has improved the training capacity of the school. As a result, for the first time in about three (3) decades, 401 FTS was able to complete ab-initio flying training for cadets of the Nigerian Defence Academy before their commissioning as officers.\n\n\u201cIn the aspect of aircraft serviceability, the NAF has trained and retrained engineers and technicians to ensure adequate maintenance of its fleet. These efforts at enhancing NAF\u2019s fleet as well as building the capacity of personnel have no doubt reflected on NAF\u2019s operational output. Coupled with the renewed and enhanced synergy among the Services and other security agencies, the acquisition and employment of these platforms has yielded tangible results in the fight against insurgency in the Northeast while recording gains in the fight against armed bandits, kidnappers, and other criminal elements in the Northwest and North Central theatres,\u201d the sources explained.\n\nWhile enumerating some of these visible gains, the available record shows that \u201cfrom January 2021 till date, the Air Component elements of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) conducted 1,015 missions in 1,357 sorties and logging 1,861hrs. The most recent achievements recorded in the OPHK Theatre included the provision of Close Air Support (CAS) to ground troops in combat with ISWAP forces equipped with twelve (12) GTs and two (2) Armoured Personnel Carriers at Damboa, Borno State on 3 June 21. Here, NAF aircraft prevented the troop\u2019s location from being overrun and inflicted heavy casualties on the ISWAP forces leading to their eventual withdraw.\n\nAir interdiction and CAS missions were also conducted at Lamboa on 20 June 21 against ISWAP elements with all five (5) of their gun trucks destroyed and several terrorists neutralized.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on 27 June 21, CAS provided for ground troops in combat with ISWAP forces at Bula Yobe on 27 Jun 21. The air operations destroyed three (3) gun trucks, neutralized many terrorists, and prevented our troop\u2019s location from being overrun. The successes recorded by NAF\u2019s air component also extended to Operation HADARIN DAJI (OPHD) in the Northwest as well.\n\n\u201cIndeed, from January 2021 to date, the air component of OPHD conducted 591 missions in 692 sorties with 943 hours flown. These operations led to the rescue of some kidnapped students whilst providing CAS for troops on clearance operations in various locations resulting in the destruction of bandit camps. Within the same period, the air component of Operation THUNDER STRIKE (OPTS) conducted 500 missions in 630 sorties with 975 hours flown with tangible results in the areas of curtailed cattle rustling, kidnapping, and banditry.\n\n\u201cThe NAF also made significant contributions to the results achieved in Operations WHIRL STROKE in the North Central; DELTA SAFE in the South-South and AWATSE in the Southwest. These efforts and successes recorded no doubt were realizable due to the improvement and enhancement in NAF\u2019s air fleet inventory that comprises aircraft of various capabilities required for different types of operations\u201d.\n\nThe statistics further stated that while the NAF had sustained its kinetic operations, it has also continued to devote resources to non-kinetic operations aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the civil populace.\n\nThese it also posited was achieved through the provision of medical facilities and school feeding programs in IDP Camps in Borno State, the conduct of medical outreaches to host communities of NAF Units across the country, provision of airlift in support of the National COVID-19 response, and availing host communities of NAF schools and medical facilities.\n\nPointing out some of the things the Nigerian Air Force has done to address of some the anomy highlighted in the preceding paragraphs, the verifiable records shows that the Service has dedicated significant time and resources to capacity building of personnel of other support trades, whilst placing a high premium on the welfare of personnel and their families to ensure enhanced performance in the field.\n\n\u201cThe welfare of personnel has also received close attention as the NAF have renovated/remodeled and constructed new blocks of classrooms and hostel accommodation in existing NAF schools across the country. In the same vein, the NAF has vigorously engaged in massive construction and renovation of residential accommodation to reduce the accommodation challenges in our bases.\n\n\u201cThe NAF has also sustained its efforts at expanding the post-service housing schemes to ease the burden of post-service life settlement for our personnel. All these were done as part of efforts to bolster morale by improving personnel welfare for effective and efficient service delivery. Healthwise, the NAF unveiled the telemedicine portal to ease personnel\u2019s access to quality healthcare that transcends borders,\u201d the information added.\n\nWhile noting that the Nigerian Air Force College of Nursing was also upgraded and accredited to offer HND programs, an insider source equally revealed that the NAF has also continued to invest heavily in Research and Development especially in Unmanned Aerial Systems technology, rockets, and rocket launchers, heat shield protective cones for the Alpha Jet rocket pods, among others.\n\nAt this juncture, it is also important to conclude by agreeing with the American journalist and former British Prime Minister that airpower is the game-changer in conventional and unconventional warfare. The terrorist fighters in the northeast are not surrendering to state forces because they have repented but because they can no longer withstand the rain of bombs falling inside their hideouts from Nigerian Air Force fighter jets and helicopter gunships.",

Abdulfatah AbdulRahman said \u201cyou will vividly recall that we cited various reasons why we opted out of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in our rally held on 19th June 2021 at M.M event center, such as the inability of the APC to demonstrate fairness, equity and provision of a level playing field for every member of the party\u201d\n\n\u201cProtracted intra-party crises, that have shown no signs of abating, saying excluding the majority of the party members across the state from exercising their legitimate rights during the membership registration and revalidation exercise was a clear signal that the current administration in kwara is not interested in securing popular mandate at the next elections\u201d\n\nAdded that the above reasons have given cause for the group to look for an alternative, viable political party where every individual can participate fully in the affairs of the party.\n\nStating the reason why the group settled for YPP, AbdulFatah said \u201cwe have reached out to the existing registered political parties in Nigeria.

Sidie Mohamed Tunis said this at the closing of the ECOWAS Parliament delocalized meeting of the Joint Committee on Energy and Mines, Industry and Private Sector, Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, which was held in Cote D\u2019 Ivoire\n\nHe noted that the meeting facilitated the sharing of information, approaches, and practical applications in effective energy management.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe meeting, in line with its specific objectives, sought to understand the greater issues of energy efficiency measures, build capability in energy management, encouraging research and development in energy-efficient technologies and raise the awareness of the public on the role of the private sector in energy conservation.\n\n\u201cThat is why there could have been no better theme than the one selected for this meeting, which is \u2018Ensuring energy efficiency in West Africa through innovation, active involvement of the private sector and citizen participation.\n\n\u201cEven more important was the disclosure of the opportunities that energy efficiency provides and how investments in energy provide relatively quick returns with a high degree of certainty\u201d.\n\nWhile noting that improving energy efficiency is about dollars and cents, the Speaker said that its impact on society is far-reaching.\n\nHe explained that the Parliament is inclined to emphasize that private sector engagement is fundamental to the community goal of achieving energy efficiency.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most powerful forces for improving lives, strengthening\n\ncommunities, and accelerating countries towards self-reliance, private-\n\nsector engagement\u2014and the approaches it leverages\u2014builds the skills,\n\nresources, knowledge, and incentives needed to improve the sector.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, in an effort to manage the Energy sector, Governments can be the effective regulators, while the private sector addresses issues relating to access and provide technical and operational capacity. Moreover, a lot can be done to reduce investors\u2019 perception of risk. Public finance is expected to\n\nplay a crucial role in creating the enabling environment, using public funds as a mobilization tool to attract private capital.\n\n\u201cGovernments can ensure commitment to long-term policies and necessary regulatory tools, in addition\n\nto creating special lending facilities aiming to provide direct support and facilitate renewable energy,\u201d he further explained.\n\nHon. Tunis observed that to improve the standard of living across our region, we must continuously explore newer technologies and\n\ninnovations.",

          "text": "Victorious Taliban fighters patrolled Kabul on Monday after a stunningly swift end to Afghanistan\u2019s 20-year war, as thousands of people mobbed the city\u2019s airport trying to flee the group\u2019s feared hardline brand of Islamist rule.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani fled the country on Sunday night as the insurgents encircled the capital, capping a military victory that saw them capture all cities in just 10 days.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban have won with the judgement of their swords and guns, and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen,\u201d Ghani said after fleeing.\n\nGovernment forces collapsed without the support of the US military, which invaded in 2001 after the September 11 attacks and toppled the Taliban for its support of Al-Qaeda.\n\nBut the United States ultimately failed to build a democratic government capable of withstanding the Taliban, despite spending billions of dollars and providing two decades of military support.\n\nAfter police and other government forces gave up their posts in Kabul on Sunday, Taliban fighters took over checkpoints across the city and entered the presidential palace.\n\nMilitants with rifles slung over their shoulders were also seen walking Monday through the streets of the Green Zone, the formerly heavily fortified district that houses most embassies and international organisations.\n\nThe Taliban sought to reassure the international community that Afghans should not fear them, and they will not take revenge against those who supported the US-backed alliance.\n\nIn a message posted to social media, Taliban co-founder Abdul Ghani Baradar called on his fighters to remain disciplined after taking control of the city.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time to test and prove, now we have to show that we can serve our nation and ensure security and comfort of life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s capture of the capital had occurred, as in many other cities, without the bloodshed that many had feared.\n\n\u2018We are afraid\u2019\n\nBut there were desperate scenes at Kabul\u2019s airport on Monday as people tried to board the few flights available.\n\n\u201cWe are afraid to live in this city,\u201d a 25-year-old ex-soldier told AFP as he stood among huge crowds on the tarmac.\n\n\u201cSince I served in the army, the Taliban would definitely target me.\u201d\n\nThe United States had sent 6,000 troops to the airport to ensure the safe evacuation of embassy staff, as well as Afghans who worked as interpreters or in other support roles.\n\nOther governments, including France and Australia, had also organised charter flights.\n\nThe US government said Monday it had secured the airport, but there was still chaos with witnesses reporting American soldiers firing shots into the air to ward off crowds.\n\nAuthorities then cancelled all remaining commercial flights because of the chaos.\n\nThe United States had earlier released a statement with more than 65 nations urging the Taliban to let Afghans leave the country, warning of accountability for any abuses.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the Taliban and all parties to \u201cexercise restraint\u201d and said the rights of women and girls, who suffered under the previous Taliban regime, must be protected.\n\nThe Taliban imposed an ultra-strict interpretation of sharia law during their 1996-2001 rule.\n\nThis included banning girls from schools and women from working, while people were publicly stoned to death for adultery.\n\nMuska Dastageer, a lecturer at the American University of Afghanistan, which opened five years after the Taliban were ousted, said Kabul residents felt \u201cfrightened and helpless\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fear just sits inside your chest like a black bird. It opens its wings and you can\u2019t breathe,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nUS credibility \u2018diminished\u2019\n\nThe US government has insisted in recent days that its two decades of war in Afghanistan was a success, defined by quashing the Al-Qaeda threat.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also said he was determined there was no choice but to withdraw American troops, as he would not \u201cpass this war\u201d onto another president.\n\nBut Washington was left shocked by the rapid collapse of the Afghan government, and critics have said the United States\u2019 reputation as a global power has been badly tarnished.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s credibility as an ally is diminished,\u201d said Husain Haqqani, Pakistan\u2019s former ambassador to the United States.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Billionaire businessman Femi Otedola has joined Nigerians in felicitating with former military President, General Ibrahim Babangida, who marks his 80th birthday on Tuesday, August 17.\n\nWishing him more rewarding years, Otedola on Sunday thanked the Retired General who is fondly called IBB for the role he played during the political logjam caused by the prolonged sickness of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua in 2010.\n\nIn his forthcoming book on business lessons \u2013 scheduled for release in November, Otedola revealed that General Babangida sent a message through him to the then-Vice President Goodluck Jonathan, to sit on the empty seat of President Yar\u2019Adua in the next Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua failing to formally transfer power to his VP when he was flown abroad for medical treatment, there was tension across the nation as a result of the power vacuum, which led to public protests.\n\n\u201cWorried by the tension and uncertainty, I decided to do something on my own,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIn the first week of February 2010, I went to Minna, Niger State, along with Hajia Bola Shagaya, to commiserate with General Ibrahim Babangida over the death of his wife, Maryam.\n\n\u201cAt his Hilltop residence, we spoke on a wide range of issues, but I told him I needed to discuss an urgent and vital issue. He took me to his study, where the two of us were alone. I told him that the state of the nation had been agitating my mind.\u201d\n\nOtedola said he asked Babangida how the country could get out of the political logjam, emphasising that the political heat at the time was \u201ctoo much\u201d.\n\nHe said a \u201ccalm and resolute\u201d IBB replied: \u2018Femi, advise your friend that when he gets to the Council Chambers next week for the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, he should go and sit on the President\u2019s chair.\u2019\n\n\u201cI found that fascinating and assured him I would pass the message across,\u201d Otedola wrote, adding, \u201cI travelled back to Abuja by road in the evening and went straight to have dinner with Dr Jonathan. I did not waste time in delivering General Babangida\u2019s message to him.\n\n\u201cHe nodded and asked me, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\n\n\u201cI laughed and said, \u2018Be a man, Your Excellency. Go and sit on that chair!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe looked at me for some time and responded that he would think about it.\n\n\u201cA week later, on Tuesday, February 9, the National Assembly adopted the famous \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019 to make Dr Jonathan the Acting President pending the return of President Yar\u2019Adua from his medical leave. Behind-the-scene moves by prominent Nigerians preceded this decision. The legislative resolution was unprecedented, but the nation had been tensed up. The fault lines were so stoked that an unusual solution was needed to address the unique situation.\n\n\u201cWith Jonathan now legally empowered to act as President, there remained the critical optics: would he stand-in for the President confidently and authoritatively? Or would he try to maintain a subdued outlook? The following day was the FEC meeting. As Dr Jonathan entered the council chamber, he was made to sit on the chair of the Vice President\u2014his usual seat.\n\n\u201cAs the protocol officer pulled out the VP\u2019s chair, Dr Jonathan marched towards the seat reserved for the President. And he sat on it! That was the moment Dr Goodluck Jonathan took control of power. By that act, he sent a strong signal to all Nigerians that he was now in charge. The same day, Jonathan even reshuffled the cabinet.\u201d\n\nYar\u2019Adua died on May 5, 2010, and Jonathan was sworn in as his replacement, going on to win the 2011 presidential elections and serving one term in office.\n\nWriting on the need for entrepreneurs to engage with political authorities in one of the chapters of his book, Otedola maintained that such a relationship will benefit the country.\n\nAccording to him, entrepreneurs\u2019 outreach and dialogue with political leaders, among many positives, will ensure stability and social coherence, guaranteeing economic progress.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cWhile many may see political engagement for entrepreneurs as one-sided\u2014in the sense that only the entrepreneur benefits\u2014the reality is that it could work both ways.\n\n\u201cI tapped into my political connections to contribute my little quota to resolving a power crisis that almost set the country on fire. This example is one of the several instances in which I used my access to the seat of power and political heavyweights to contribute to nation-building and national development. Entrepreneurs need to appreciate the fact that peace for the country is peace for their businesses, too. We need a stable and peaceful country first and foremost.\u201d",

          "text": "Roger Federer\u2019s return to the court is uncertain and says he is going to miss the US Open and be sidelined for what he said will be \u201cmany months\u201d because he needs a third operation on his right knee, a procedure he said will leave him with \u201ca glimmer of hope\u201d that he can return to competition.\n\nFederer announced the news Sunday via a video message on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of checks with the doctors, as well, on my knee, getting all the information, as I hurt myself further during the grass-court season and Wimbledon,\u201d Federer said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, they told me for the medium to long term, to feel better, I will need surgery, so I decided to do it. I will be on crutches for many weeks and then also out of the game for many months.\u201d\n\nFederer, 40, who has 20 Grand Slam singles titles to share the men\u2019s record with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, acknowledged there was a chance his playing career could be over, but he said he would rehab the knee with the goal of making another comeback.\n\n\u201cI want to be healthy. I want to be running around later, as well, again, and I want to give myself a glimmer of hope, also, to return to the tour in some shape or form,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI am realistic, don\u2019t get me wrong. I know how difficult it is at this age right now to do another surgery and try it.\u201d\n\nFederer missed more than a year of action after first having his knee repaired shortly after the 2020 Australian Open in February of that year. He had a follow-up procedure that June.\n\nHe returned to Grand Slam action at the French Open in late May and then pulled out of the tournament after three victories. His most recent match was a loss at the Wimbledon quarterfinals last month, and he cited the knee injury in withdrawing from the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe US Open is the season\u2019s last Grand Slam tournament, and it begins Aug. 30 in New York. Nadal is dealing with a foot injury, and Djokovic pulled out of tuneup tournaments, saying he needed to rest and recuperate following the Olympics, where he failed to win a medal.\n\nFederer won 16 of his Grand Slam titles between 2003 and 2010 but remained at or near the top of the sport into his late 30s. He won the Australian Open and Wimbledon during a resurgent 2017 and defended his title at Melbourne Park in 2018, his most recent Grand Slam championship. In 2019, he lost a five-set classic to Djokovic in the Wimbledon final.\n\nFederer\u2019s spot in the US Open main draw will go to Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands, the U.S. Tennis Association said. American Mackie McDonald would be the next man to move into the field if there is another withdrawal.",

          "text": "Billionaire businessman Femi Otedola has revealed how ex-Nigerian military president Ibrahim Babangida asked then vice president Goodluck Jonathan to \u201csit on the President\u2019s chair at the Council Chambers next week for the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\u201d\n\nMr Otedola in a statement Sunday while felicitating with Babangida on the occasion of his 80th birthday thanked IBB for the role he played during the political logjam caused by the prolonged sickness of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua in 2010.\n\nIn his forthcoming book on business lessons (scheduled for release in November), Otedola revealed that Babangida sent a message through him to then Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan to sit on the empty seat of the President in the next Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\n\n\u201cWith Yar\u2019Adua failing to formally transfer power to his VP when he was flown abroad for medical treatment, there was tension across the nation as a result of the power vacuum, which led to public protests,\u201d Mr Otedola noted in the statement.\n\n\u201cWorried by the tension and uncertainty, I decided to do something on my own,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the first week of February 2010, I went to Minna, Niger state, along with Hajia Bola Shagaya, to commiserate with General Ibrahim Babangida over the death of his wife, Maryam. At his Hilltop residence, we spoke on a wide range of issues, but I told him I needed to discuss an urgent and vital issue. He took me to his study, where the two of us were alone. I told him that the state of the nation had been agitating my mind.\u201d\n\nOtedola said he asked Babangida: \u201cYour Excellency, how can we get out of this logjam? The political heat is too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm and resolute, IBB replied: \u2018Femi, advise your friend that when he gets to the Council Chambers next week for the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, he should go and sit on the President\u2019s chair.\u2019 I found that fascinating and assured him I would pass the message across. I travelled back to Abuja by road in the evening and went straight to have dinner with Dr Jonathan. I did not waste time in delivering General Babangida\u2019s message to him,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cHe nodded and asked me, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\n\n\u201cI laughed and said, \u2018Be a man, Your Excellency. Go and sit on that chair!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe looked at me for some time and responded that he would think about it.\n\n\u201cA week later, on Tuesday, February 9, the National Assembly adopted the famous \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019 to make Dr Jonathan the Acting President pending the return of President Yar\u2019Adua from his medical leave. Behind-the-scene moves by prominent Nigerians preceded this decision. The legislative resolution was unprecedented, but the nation had been tensed up. The fault lines were so stoked that an unusual solution was needed to address the unique situation.\n\n\u201cWith Jonathan now legally empowered to act as President, there remained the critical optics: would he stand-in for the President confidently and authoritatively? Or would he try to maintain a subdued outlook? The following day was the FEC meeting. As Dr Jonathan entered the Council Chamber, he made to sit on the chair of the Vice President\u2014his usual seat.\n\n\u201cAs the protocol officer pulled out the VP\u2019s chair, Dr Jonathan marched towards the seat reserved for the President. And he sat on it! That was the moment Dr Goodluck Jonathan took control of power. By that act, he sent a strong signal to all Nigerians that he was now in charge. The same day, Jonathan even reshuffled the cabinet.\u201d\n\nYar\u2019Adua died on May 5, 2010, and Jonathan was sworn in as his replacement, going on to win the 2011 presidential elections and serving one term in office.\n\nIn the book, Otedola said entrepreneurs must engage with political authorities because it is only when there is peace that the economy can boom.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cWhile many may see political engagement for entrepreneurs as one-sided\u2014in the sense that only the entrepreneur benefits\u2014the reality is that it could work both ways. I tapped into my political connections to contribute my little quota to resolving a power crisis that almost set the country on fire.\n\n\u201cThis example is one of the several instances in which I used my access to the seat of power and political heavyweights to contribute to nation-building and national development. Entrepreneurs need to appreciate the fact that peace for the country is peace for their businesses, too. We need a stable and peaceful country first and foremost.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
