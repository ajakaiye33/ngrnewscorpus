          "text": "\u2026Deadline to inaugurate NDDC board expired with FG doing nothing tangible\n\n\u2026What should be done to avoid breakdown of law and order\n\nBy Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South\n\nEX-MILITANT leader, Government Ekpemupolo, alias Tompolo, on Friday, said the deadline which Minister of Niger-Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, agreed with stakeholders for the Federal Government to constitute the governing board of Niger Delta Development Commission, has elapsed with the government doing nothing tangible.\n\nTompolo, in a statement, said they decided on June ending, but obviously government has failed once again, warning: \u201cThe people are seriously agitated, there is palpable fear and tension in the region.\u201d\n\nHis statement read in part: \u201cIt could be recalled that I issued ultimatum to the Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, the National Assembly and President Muhammadu Buhari to do the needful on the issue of the NDDC board by constituting the substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as an urgent matter of public importance and interest to avoid a breakdown of law and order in the region, sometime ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ultimatum led to a consultative meeting between major stakeholders from the region and Senator Godswill Akpabio in Oporoza town, where a truce was reached, as the Minister profusely pleaded that he should be allowed to start and fast-track the process of constituting the board within the month of June 2021.\n\n\u201cJune 2021 has come to an end. The people of the region are yet to see any tangible move towards the constitution of the NDDC board by the Federal Government. The people are seriously agitated. There is palpable fear and tension in the region.\n\n\u201cI wish to reiterate my earlier position that, the government should as a matter of urgency, constitute the substantive board of the NDDC to avoid unnecessary bickering and crisis in the region. Since I reluctantly accepted the outcome of the consultative meeting, I have done so much to keep peace in the region which some major stakeholders in the security circle are aware of.\n\nI have been in constant touch with my fellow agitators in the region to give peace a chance, knowing fully well that there cannot be any meaningful development in an atmosphere of rancour and acrimony.\n\n\u201cAs it stands now, the one thing the government must do in this issue is to be courageous enough to constitute the NDDC board. Government must be sincere in handling developmental issues in the Niger Delta region as the people have suffered enough, being neglected for several decades.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that there is so much bitterness in the land owing to the lackadaisical attitude of this government in handling matters of great importance to its citizens.\n\n\u201cAs for my follow agitators, please permit me to borrow the biblical words of Jesus Christ, which is we should be wise as a serpent and gentle as a dove to continue our agitation for a better living for our people.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid anything that may throw the only relatively peaceful region in the country now, into chaos because of government\u2019s nonchalant attitude towards the security and welfare of its citizenry as constitutionally provided.\n\nThe average Nigerian citizen is a government of his or her own as the citizens provide everything for themselves today.\n\nThe government is unfair to a greater number of its citizens. The Nigerian Government must create an enabling environment for the citizens to live a prosperous and peaceful life.\n\n\u201cMultinational oil companies operating in the Niger delta region are not left out in the troubles of the region.\n\nThey are clearly part of the conspiracy in the marginalization of the region. They must perform their statutory obligations to the people of the region by promptly delivering corporate social responsibility to the people.\n\n\u201cMost of the companies are operating under the cover of the Nigerian Military, which has further exacerbated the relationship between Multinationals and their host communities. They must do their business in a most friendly atmosphere, and not to set neighboring host communities against one another,\u201d the former warlord said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Peter Duru, Makurdi\n\nBenue tribal leaders and heads of the three main socio-cultural organizations in the state have urged the federal government to deploy the same strategy that led to the re-arrest of the leader of IPOB, Mr Nnamdi Kanu to the arrest of leaders of Miyetti Allah and Fulani herdsmen terrorist groups allegedly responsible for the wanton killings and sacking of communities in the state and country.\n\nThe IPOB leader was arrested and extradited to Nigeria last Sunday after four years in exile.\n\nThe leaders of Mzough U Tiv, MUT, Worldwide, Ochetoha K\u2019 Idoma and Omi Ny\u2019Igede in a statement Friday in Makurdi signed by their Chairman and President General of MUT, Chief Iorbee Ihagh commended the government but cautioned that justice should be done in the matter for the good of the country.\n\nPart of the statement read, \u201cas we commend the Federal Government for this feat as part of efforts to address insecurity in our great country, we wish to draw the attention of the government to another security challenge that portends great danger to food and national security \u2013 the activities of militia herdsmen and their sponsors.\n\n\u201cWe wish to place on record that in Benue State in particular and Nigeria in general, militia herdsmen under the guise of grazing their cattle, have visited mayhem on farmers leading to killings and displacement of thousands from their ancestral homes with farmlands no longer accessible.\n\n\u201cHundreds have been orphaned and wives widowed. Peasant farmers who had hitherto, contributed to making Benue Food Basket of the Nation can no longer go to their farms for fear of being killed. The hunger in the land is unimaginable.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned and worried that the federal government has refused to look inwards by arresting leaders of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore and other violent Fulani groups who openly threaten and carry out attacks on communities in Benue and other states of this country without any form of resistance.\n\n\u201cIf the same energy expended in arresting Nnamdi Kanu can\u2019t be applied to arrest \u2018terrorists\u2019 who are freely walking on the streets of Abuja and other cities of Nigeria, then it is questionable.\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the President Muhammadu Buhari in a recent address, alluded to the fact that foreign herdsmen are living inside forests across Nigeria and are responsible for the banditry and other terrorist activities in the country.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, these people have known links that speak out when some of the attacks are carried out. Unfortunately, they have never been invited for questioning by security agencies. What a fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state unequivocally that in Benue State, militia herdsmen are 95 percent behind insecurity and hunger. They threaten, attack and claim responsibility for the killings. We wonder why the Federal Government turns a deaf ear to such insolence. What a selective justice.\n\n\u201cIt is our firm belief that in Benue State anytime the Federal Government decides that our people should go back to their farms to continue with their farming activities, decisive steps will be taken.\n\n\u201cChief of which is the arrest of the masterminds of attacks on our people and to ask herdsmen to stay away from our state or better still, embrace ranching as the global best practice of animals husbandry.\u201d",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae, Abuja\n\nA Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday scheduled judgment for September 10 in the suit by ex-Abia State Governor, Orji Uzor Kalu against his retrial.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo chose the date after entertaining final arguments from lawyers representing parties.\n\nKalu is by the suit, challenging his planned retrial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a N7.1billion fraud case, after the Supreme Court voided his earlier trial and conviction along with two others.\n\nThe ex-governor, who hinged his case on Section 36 (9) of the Constitution argued that been tried, convicted and sentenced on same charges, FHC/ABJ/CR/56/ 2007, by the court under Justice M.B. Idris, it would amount to double jeopardy if he is subjected to a fresh trial on same charge\n\nKalu was charged and tried with his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited and an ex-Finance Director in the state, Ude Jones Udeogu for their alleged complicity in diverting the N7.1b from Abia State\u2019s coffers.\n\nThey were convicted and, while Kalu and Udeogu were imprisoned, Slok was wound up.\n\nBut, upon an appeal by Udeogu, the Supreme Court set aside their trial and conviction in a judgment on May 8, 2020 on the grounds that the trial judge, having been elevated, ought not to have continued to hear the case.\n\nIn the judgment marked: SC/62C/2019 filed by Udeogu, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in the case.\n\nIt is that retrial that Kalu now seeks to prevent with his suit, in which he argued among others that a retrial would subject him to double jeopardy.\n\nOn Friday, Prof. Awa Kalu, SAN, (lawyer to Kalu), George Ukaegbu (for Udeogu) and Chris Uche, SAN, (for Slok) urged the court to uphold the ex-governor\u2019s argument.\n\nKalu contended that, in the absence of any extant judgment or order of a competent court directing his client\u2019s fresh trial, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) cannot engage in any retrial.\n\nHe argued that there was no disagreement among parties that his client was not a party to the appeal before the Supreme Court and that the order for retrial made by the Supreme Court did not relate to his client.\n\nKalu noted that the former governor stood for trial for 12 years, convicted and jailed for 10 years.\n\nHe added that the former governor, having served a period of jail term, would be subjected to double jeopardy if allowed by the court to be put on trial for the second time.\n\nReading from a copy of the Supreme Court judgment, upon which Kalu was released from prison after five months, the lawyer stated that there was nowhere in the judgment where his client trial was ordered to be retried.\n\nKalu, who challenged the EFCC to point out where the order for his client\u2019s retrial is contained in the judgment, urged the court to prohibit the anti-graft agency from proceeding with the planned retrial.\n\nIn a counter-argument, lawyer to the EFCC, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) faulted Kalu\u2019s position and urged the court to dismiss the suit.\n\nJacobs noted that it amounted to blowing hot and cold at the same time for Kalu to have benefited from the Supreme Court judgment, but yet, seeks to avoid the burden of retrial contained in the same judgment.\n\nHe submitted that the judgment, on which basis Kalu was jailed has been declared a nullity by the Supreme Court, which also ordered retrial of the appellant (Udeogu) in the same charge on which he was jointly tried with Kalu and Slok.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJacobs added that since Kalu took advantage of the Supreme Court judgment, on which basis he was released, he must bear the burden that arose from the same judgment.\n\nHe described the suit by the ex-governor as an attempt at approbating and reprobating at the same time. He further described it as frivolous, irritating and prayed the court to dismiss it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa was sighted in court shortly after the conclusion of the proceedings.\n\nDressed in white native attire, Bawa was accompanied by some lawyers and security operatives. It was not clear what he was in court for.\n\nHe was later seen heading towards the office of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court.",

But, the All Progressives Congress (APC) convention itself has remained elusive.\n\nAlthough the unelected National Caretaker Committee, led by Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni, has unfolded plans for ward, local government and state congresses, the fate of the national congress is hanging in the balance.\n\nWhat actually is delaying the convention?\n\nReminiscent of how Military President Ibrahim Babangida was postponing the handover date, tinkering with the transition programme and changing the goal post amid the game,the tenure of the Buni Committee had been extended thrice. The latest extention of the tenure of the interim committee is worrisome as it is indefinite. This has fuelled speculations about an inexplicable hidden agenda.\n\nThe chairmanship aspirants, nevertheless, rely on hope, the elixir of life. The seven are from the North. This may give a vague idea of imminent rotation or zoning, both of the chairmanship and the presidency.\n\nFormer Nasarawa State Governor Tanko Almakura has not publicly declared his intention. But, party sources said the chieftain of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) is a strong contender. A source said:\u201dThe president is always a fan of his old allies.\u201d It could not be ascertained whether he will also emerge as the candidate of the APC Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\nFifty five year old Senator Sani Musa, who hails from Paikoro in Niger State, has embarked on extensive consultation and mobilisation. A loyal party man, Musa has been described as a man of integrity. He is a one-time governorship contender in Niger State, a delegate to the National Convention, and a member of the APC Presidential Election Campaign Committee for 2019.\n\nThe senator had canvassed the revolution of the electoral system through the use of the card reader and Permanent Voter\u2019s Card. Many have described him as a bridge builder who possess high inter-personal skills.\n\nIn the Senate, he had served on some committees, including Appropriation, Petroleum Resources, Foreign and Local Debts and Water Resources. In the APC, he had served as member of NEC, Contact and Strategic Committee, and Constitution Review Panel.\n\nIn 2015, he was arrested, but refused to divulge any confidential information on the card reader. The Business Administration graduate from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, where he was the President of Zodiac, served as Special Adviser on Investment and Infrastructure in Niger State; director of Niger State Development Company Limited, Chairman, Task Force on Environmental Management and Managing Director, First Pacific Nigeria Limited. He also obtained a Certificate in Conflict Analysis from the United States Institute of Peace. Musa is held in esteem in the senate as an organised, dedicated, passionate and hardworking politician. He is said to be goal oriented, focussed and patriotic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Adamu is a party elder endowed with experience. He is a no-nonsense politician. He knows his onions. After serving as governor for eight years, he was elected senator. In 2007, he was a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAnother aspirant is the eminent politician from Gombe State, former Governor Danjuma Goje, former Minister of State for Steel Development and now, senator. He is also a former PDP chieftain; bold and fearless.\n\nFormer Borno State Governor Modu Sheriff served as a senator before becoming governor in 2003. He served for two terms. He defected from the APC to PDP, where he was briefly the national chairman. There were allegations that he wanted to use the position as a stepping stone to the realisation of his presidential ambition. When he was shoved aside as chairman, Senator Ahmed Makarfi became the PDP caretaker chairman. Some months ago, Sheriff retraced his steps to the APC.\n\nMohammed Mustapha hails from Gambari District in the Ilorin East local government area of Kwara State. He is 48 years old.\n\nHe has distinguished himself in business, politics and humanitarian services. He founded the Saliu Mustapha Foundation to serve as a platform for human empowerment and community development.\n\nMustapha is a former deputy national chairman of CPC. He played a role in the merger of the CPC with other tendencies that gave birth to the APC. He was a signatory to the merger agreement on behalf of the CPC in the coalition. Before he became the deputy chairman of the CPC, he had served as an Ex-Officio and a foundation NEC member of the party.\n\nHe was the National Publicity Secretary of the Progressive Liberation Party (PLP) between 2001 and 2002 under the leadership of Dr. Ezekiel Ezeogwu. In 2003, Mustapha and other like-minds formed the Progressive Action Congress (PAC). He was the National Publicity Secretary of the party. He was a member of The Buhari Organisation (TBO) and the Buhari Campaign Organisation (BCO).\n\nAPC is in a dilemma. Consensus building appears difficult. There are internal contradictions. There are divisions. Can these pave the way for a peaceful convention?",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nFourteen years after the first attempt was made, the Senate and House of Representatives, yesterday, passed into law the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB).\n\nBut it was not without controversy and drama as senators and House of Reps disagreed on what percentage host communities should get from crude oil drilled in their areas.\n\nThe bill had originally proposed 2.5 per cent Equity Share Holding for Host Communities but the joint committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream, Downstream and Gas) recommended five per cent in its final submision.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives raised the amount from 2.5 per cent to five per cent and passed the bill into law, senators from the northern part of the country rejected the five per cent recommended by its committee and insisted on three per cent.\n\nKaita Ahmed, representing President Muhammadu Buhari in the Senate, led the onslaught against the five per cent. Although senators who supported the retainment of the five per cent had their way when it was subjected to voice vote, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, however, ruled contrarily.\n\nThe development led to a rowdy session as senators mainly from the south rejected the ruling even as Lawan tried without success to restore order.\n\nNorthern lawmakers, it was learnt, felt the allocation of five per cent would deprive other states of funds accruing from oil production in the Niger Delta even as they argued that three per cent was enough based on the briefing they got from Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipreye Sylva.\n\nSenaor Albert Bassey, however, explained that the reason for recommending five per cent was to remedy unfortunate incidents that may affect the assets.\n\nDissatisfied with the decision of the Lawan-led morthern senators, George Sekibo from Rivers State raised a Point of Order. He cited Order 73, which challenges the ruling of the chairman (Mr Lawan), and requires that he put the question to vote a second time. And should his opinion be again challenged, he should call each senators name to vote.\n\nLeader of the Senate, Yahaya Abdullahi, called on Sekibo to step down the request for individual senators\u2019 names to be called to vote on the issue. Lawan also appealed to Sekibo to step down the request.\n\n\u201cThis three per cent, at least the Senate did not pass 2.5 per cent, we passed something slightly higher than that. I appeal to Sekibo to withdraw the point of order. We should not insist on dividing the Senate. It is our right,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nIn withdrawing the call for a head count, Sekibo said the decision was against the interest of the country.\n\nDeputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, appeal to his northern colleagues to retain the five per cent also crashed.\n\nThe senate went ahead to approval a Host Community Trust Fund, which would be anchored by oil and gas companies operating in the host communities for the three per cent.\n\nThere is, however, the fear that host communities in the Niger Delta may only get a meagre share of three per cent if the figure is not harmonised by both chambers.\n\nThe Senate, however, approved a 30 per cent funding mechanism for Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) profit to fund exploration of frontier basins in parts of the country where search for crude oil in commercial quantity is ongoing.\n\nThere is an ongoing search for oil in commercial quantity in some northern states but no search in any part of the 17 southern states.\n\nThe Bill has also empowered the Minister of Petroleum to exercise certain supervisory powers in the management of the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe Bill states that the Minister shall \u201cformulate, monitor and administer government policy in the petroleum industry, exercise general supervision over the affairs and operations of the petroleum industry in accordance with the provisions of this Act, report developments in the petroleum industry to the government, represent Nigeria at international organisations on petroleum matters, promote an enabling environment for investment in the Nigerian petroleum industry,\n\nThe Bill also unbundled the NNPC into two commercialised corporation.\n\n\u201cThere is established the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (the Commission) which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. There is established the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (the Authority), which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. The Authority shall have the power to acquire, hold and dispose of property, sue and be sued in its own name.\n\n\u201cThe Authority shall be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry. The objects and functions of the Authority in this Part are limited to midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry.\n\nThe objectives of the Authority shall be to regulate midstream and downstream petroleum operations, including technical, operational, and commercial activities; ensure efficient, safe, effective and sustainable infrastructural development of midstream and downstream.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja, Emma Emeozor\n\nFederal Government said it has launched a manhunt for collaborators of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and would prosecute them irrespective of their status in the society.\n\nAt a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, revealed that Nigeria\u2019s intelligence and security agencies were on Kanu\u2019s trail across continents spanning two years before he was finally intercepted on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe commend the professionalism, diligence, patriotism and painstaking efforts of our security and intelligence agencies. We also thank the sister international agencies that collaborated with us to pull off this arrest.\n\n\u201cIt will interest Nigerians to know that for over two years, our security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of the proscribed IPOB leader as he lived a five-star life across several countries, travelling on chartered private jets, living in luxury apartments and turning out in designing clothes and shoes.\n\n\u201cOf course, as we all saw, he was wearing an attire made by Fendi, a luxury Italian fashion brand, when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cWe can tell you that the forensic investigation carried out so far has revealed a treasure trove of information on the proscribed IPOB leader and his collaborators.\n\n\u201cWhile the investigation continues, we assure you that none of the collaborators, irrespective of their standing in the society, will be spared.\n\n\u201cThey will all face the full wrath of the law for their activities that challenge our nation\u2019s sovereignty and threaten its unity. No one, no matter how highly placed, is bigger than the country.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that many are suddenly calling for a fair trial for Kanu as if he didn\u2019t get one before he decided to jump bail and flee.\n\n\u201cHowever, I can assure you that the fair deal that Kanu denied many of the victims of the violence which he willfully instigated through his broadcasts and tweets will not be denied him.\n\n\u201cFinally, there have been speculations on how this re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed.\n\n\u201cWhat we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations. We continue to respect and honour the obligations.\u201d\n\nKanu, who is facing an 11-count charge of treason, treasonable felony, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms, among others, jumped bail in 2017 and left the country.\n\nAn Abuja High Court had on Tuesday granted the Department of State Services (DSS) custody of Kanu after he was arraigned and denied bail. His next appearance in court is on July 26-27.\n\nMeanwhile, a day after Kingsley, younger brother of the IPOB leader said the separatist leader was arrested in Kenya, Nairobi has denied the claim.\n\nSpokeswoman for the Kenyan interior ministry said it was not aware of the matter while the foreign affairs ministry in Nairobi did not respond to a request for comment, Reuters said. The reaction of the government of Kenya came as confusion trails the location Kanu was intercepted by security operatives.\n\nThe British High Commission in Nigeria has also said Kanu was not arrested in the United Kingdom where the embattled IPOB leader is a citizen. In a press release, the Mission said: \u201cIn response to any question on whether Nnamdi Kanu was extradited from the UK, we can reaffirm that Nnamdi Kanu was not arrested in the UK and nor was he extradited from the UK.\u201d\n\nThe UK has said it plans to seek clarification from the Federal Government, circumstances surrounding the arrest of Kanu. At a press conference on Monday, Malami break the news of Kanu\u2019s arrest saying he was intercepted following diligent intelligence by \u201cour security and intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nGovernor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has advised the Federal Government to ensure rule of law and due process is followed in Kalu\u2019s prosecution.\n\nHe said conscientious effort must be made by the Federal Government to allay the fear of some Nigerians that Kanu is not being prosecuted because he comes from a particular section of the country.\n\nGovernor Wike, who made this assertion during a television interview, explained that irrespective of the differences the arrested IPOB leader has with Rivers State government, due process must be followed in his prosecution.\n\nHe stated that for the Federal Government to demonstrate its resolve to address insecurity crisis facing the country, the same dragnet deployed to arrest Kanu must, as a matter of urgency, be extended to bandits and Miyetti Allah militias terrorising the country.\n\n\u201cWe must not make hullabaloo about the prosecution of Nnamdi Kanu. I don\u2019t agree with his principle. I have come out and said you (Kanu) cannot annex my State to be your own. But that does not mean that you\u2019ll not allow the law to take its course.\u201d\n\nThe governor insisted that government must arrest every wanted terrorist on its watchlist and ensure they are brought to book to face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say because Nnamdi Kanu is from a particular area, let us prosecute him. The same thing must apply to all other people, the bandits, Miyetti Allah.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Benue Governor, Samuel Ortom urged the Federal Government to zealously arrest leaders of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore (MAKH) same way it arrested the Biafran freedom fighter.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government has demonstrated capacity to arrest Kanu, they should also exhibit the same zeal, will and decision to arrest Fulani herdsmen terrorising our state and country.\n\n\u201cLet that be done, they are living here with us. If Nnamdi Kanu can be arrested from a foreign land.

SUNDAY IGBOHO at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place.\n\n\u201cOn approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be IGBOHO\u2019s guards. Six (6) of them were armed with AK-47 gun and Three (3) others, with Pump-Action riffles.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two (2) of IGBOHO\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and is very stable.\n\n\u201cAfterwards, the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered the following among others:Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles; three (3) Pump Action guns; thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines and five thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition.\n\nHe also stated that five (5) cutlasses , one (1) Jack knife, one (1) Pen Knife;\n\ntwo (2) Pistol holsters;one (1) binoculars ; a wallet containing Five (5) US Dollars in one (1) Dollar denomination; local and international driver\u2019s licences in his name, ATM Cards, a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name were found.\n\nAlso discovered , he said were two (2) whistles; fifty (5) Cartridges; eighteen (18) Walkie-Talkies;\n\nthree voodoo charm jackets/traditional body armour;\n\ntwo (2) Laptops (One (1) Toshiba and One (1) Compaq); and his International Passport and those of many others (as displayed here).

          "title": "DSS Raids Igboho\u2019s House, Declares Him Wanted",
          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) said last night that it raided the residence of the Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, accusing him and his associates of planning a violent insurrection against the state.\n\nThe secret police said its operatives raided his residence in Soka, Ibadan yesterday and arrested 13 of his associates.\n\nIt said operatives recovered seven AK-47 assault rifles, 30 fully charged AK-47 magazines and 5,000 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition.\n\nParading the suspects, the Public Relations Officer of the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, said Igboho, in the course of agitation for self-determination, had become well-armed and a threat to public order.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe agency wishes to inform Nigerians and the world that Sunday Igboho and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order.\n\n\u201cThis, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by Igboho and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\u201d\n\nThe agency also alerted \u201cforeign missions and licensing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that Igboho could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\u201d\n\nAfunanya said the agency needed to inform stakeholders that the five AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building were suspected to be those collected by Igboho\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State.\n\nHe said his associates engaged the operatives in a gun duel.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe gun duel, which lasted for an hour offered Igboho the chance to escape. Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho is now on the run. Igboho may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him.\n\n\u201cBut this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will surely fail him and the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\u201d\n\nHe advised Igboho to turn himself into the nearest security agency, calling also on those cheering and eulogising him to appeal to or advise him to do the needful.\n\n\u201cHe should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly,\u201d he said\n\nAfenifere, Others Kick\n\nApparently thinking that the raid was an unlawful attack, the pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere; the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO); a former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode; and the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, yesterday condemned the attack on Igboho\u2019s residence.\n\nWhile Adams claimed that eight people were killed, an aide to Igboho put the death toll at two.\n\n\u201cThe situation now is very bad. Two Yoruba sons have been killed in the house of Chief Sunday Igboho. The two bodies have been taken away by the military. We do not know of the location where they were taken to,\u201d Igboho\u2019s spokesman, Mr. Olayomi Koiki, said.\n\nThose who lost their lives were said to be relatives of Igboho.\n\nThere were bloodstains on the floor of the premises as well as some of the rooms, indicating that some persons were hit by bullets.\n\nThere were also expended bullets at the front of the house and also on the premises.\n\nSome vehicles destroyed by bullets included a Sienna bus branded with pictures of Prof. Banji Akintoye and Igboho.\n\nReacting to the incident, Afenifere and IOO had accused the federal government of being behind the attack.\n\nAfenifere in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said the manner of the attack indicated culpability on the part of the government.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe are forced into this deduction for a number of reasons. Firstly, eyewitness accounts indicated that the vehicles and uniforms of the attackers were that of the security agencies. Secondly, the failure of security agencies to confront the attackers further implicated the government. It was reported that the attack lasted for more than three hours. \u201cIgboho\u2019s residence is in a highly-populated area within minutes\u2019 reach to surrounding police stations. That no rescue team came from any of the police units, including the DSS office in Ibadan for the several hours that the attack lasted, makes it difficult not to believe that the government is complicit in the attack\u201d.\n\nIn his reaction, Fani-Kayode said two people were killed and their bodies were taken away with a large number of others arrested.\n\nHe added that Igboho\u2019s passport and travel documents were stolen together with his phones, his personal effects, computers and N2 million.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere were about 100 soldiers and security agents involved and Sunday managed to escape after his boys shielded him from the bullets. They insisted that he should leave whilst they resisted the attack as best as they could and with few numbers.\n\n\u201cMy question is this: what has this man done to deserve this? There is nothing he has been asked to do in terms of keeping the peace in the South-west by the federal government and the Yoruba elders that he has not done, including guaranteeing the security and safety of the local Hausa-Fulani population, building bridges, keeping the peace and having a dialogue with other ethnic nationalities in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Kehinde Aderemi, Adams said the attack was a ploy to silence Igboho from expressing his views on the state of the nation.\n\nHe, however, charged the federal government to investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack and to bring the perpetrators to book.\n\nIOO in a statement by Emeritus Prof. Banji Akintoye, and made available to THISDAY by his Communications Manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, accused the Nigerian Army, accompanied by those he labelled international terrorists hired by the Nigerian state, of attacking Igboho\u2019s home.\n\nAkintoye also alleged that the assailants were all dressed in military uniform and spoke the French language fluently.\n\nHe stated that the gunmen killed seven occupants of the building and whisked away Igboho\u2019s wife and others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u00b7 Divests NNPC of regulatory power\n\n\u00b7 Presidency: Jinx broken\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe two chambers of the National Assembly yesterday passed the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), after about 13 years of legislative fireworks.\n\nAlthough the House of Representatives apparently skipped certain parliamentary procedures to pass the bill as witnessed by journalists at plenary, the Chairman of the House Ad-hoc Committee on the PIB, Hon. Mohammed Monguno, later told reporters that what transpired at the plenary did not actually mean that they passed it as widely reported.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the demons behind the non-passage of the bill for many years had been defeated.\n\nAlso, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare said the federal lawmakers had broken the jinx.\n\nHowever, there was uproar at the Senate as the senators disagreed on the profit share percentage to be allocated to the host communities in the PIB, before finally settling for three per cent.\n\nThe Senate passed the much-awaited PIB after a clause-by-clause consideration of all the 318 clauses of the bill.\n\nThe bill was first sent to the National Assembly in 2008 by President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, now deceased, without translating into an Act.\n\nChairman of the Senate Joint Committee on Petroleum Upstream/Downstream and Gas, Senator Sabo Nakudu, had earlier while presenting its committee\u2019s report before the Senate went into a closed-door session with the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari.\n\nThe bill had proposed five per cent of the annual profit share of the oil companies for the host communities.\n\nShortly after the Senate resumed plenary after its executive session with Sylva and Kyari, Lawan commenced the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill.\n\nBy the time he got to clause 240, which made provision for five per cent trust fund for host communities, the plenary became rowdy.\n\nExplaining why the five per cent was reduced to three per cent shortly after the plenary, Nakudu said the earlier percentage, which was 2.5 was increased to five per cent.\n\nHe added that it was reduced after Kyari explained that five per cent is a huge amount of money.\n\nAccording to him, the three per cent amounts to half a billion dollars, adding that enabling environment needs to be created to attract investors as fossil oil is fast going out of fashion.\n\nMajority of senators later voted for three per cent contribution to the host communities, following a motion by Senator Ahmad Kaita, seconded by Senator Ibrahim Gobir, for an amendment to clause 240(2) of the bill.\n\nEfforts by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, Senators James Manager, George Sekibo and Albert Akpan for an upward review were rejected.\n\nSekibo, in a move to sustain his agitation for an increase in contributions to host communities, relied on Order 73 of the Senate Rule and called for a division.\n\nBut the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, prevailed on him to withdraw his call for division and reminded him of the commitment of senators to fostering unity while keeping in mind their obligation at all times to protect the national interest.\n\nLawan also told Sekibo of the overwhelming support of the lawmakers who had earlier approved that host communities should receive remediation and relief from monies accruing from gas flaring in the PIB.\n\nSekibo then withdrew his earlier call for division. During a clause-by-clause consideration of the bill, the Senate also approved the funding mechanism of 30 per cent of NNPC Limited\u2019s oil and gas profit in the production sharing, profit sharing, and risk service contracts to fund exploration of frontier basins.\n\nIt approved clause 4 of the bill, which seeks the establishment of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission to provide technical regulatory functions to enforce, administer and implement laws, regulations and policies relating to upstream petroleum operations. The commission will, among others, ensure compliance with applicable national and international petroleum industry policies, standards and practices for upstream petroleum operations; and establish, monitor, regulate and enforce health, safety and environmental measures and standards relating to upstream petroleum operations.\n\nIn addition, the Senate also adopted the committee\u2019s recommendation to retain provisions in Clause 29 of the bill, approved the establishment of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.\n\nClause 29(3) empowers the agency to be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry in Nigeria.\n\nIts function include implementing government\u2019s policies for midstream and downstream petroleum operations as directed by the minister; and to promote, establish and develop a positive environment for international and domestic investment in midstream and downstream petroleum operations.\n\nOthers are to ensure strict environmental implementation of policies, laws and regulations for midstream and downstream petroleum operations; and to develop and enforce a framework on tariff and pricing for natural gas and petroleum products. The recommendation of the joint committee was amended in clause 52(7d) to ensure that all monies received from gas flaring be channelled for the purpose of environmental remediation and relief of the host communities as against the development of infrastructure in midstream gas operations. The Senate, however, retained the recommendation of the joint committee in Clause 53, which empowers the Minister of Petroleum Resources to incorporate Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation as a limited liability company, to be known as NNPC Limited, six months after the commencement of the Act.\n\nIt adopted clause 53 that mandates the minister, at the incorporation of NNPC Limited, to consult with the Minister of Finance to determine the number and nominal value of the shares to be allotted, which would form the initial paid-up share capital of NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Senate also approved the ownership of all shares in NNPC Limited to be vested in the government at incorporation and held by the Ministry of Finance Incorporated on behalf of the government.\n\nLawan, after the passage of the PIB congratulated the National Assembly and the Joint Committee on Downstream Petroleum Sector; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); and Gas for the \u201ctremendous and historical achievement of passing the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill.\u201d\n\nHe said the passage of the PIB was an indication that the \u201cdemon\u201d behind its non-passage in the past had been finally defeated.\n\nLawan appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to give expeditious assent to the bill when it is eventually forwarded to him.\n\nAddressing journalists on PIB after plenary, the Senate spokesman, Senator Ajibola Bashiru, said: \u201cOn the three per cent that was approved for the upstream operating expenditure, from the projection made by the NNPC GMD, who briefed us, it will amount to $502.8million for the host community development fund.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly (Senate), Omoworare, has congratulated Buhari, Lawan, and the Speaker of the House Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, on the passage of the PIB by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt should be noted that the efforts by the executive and legislature in Nigeria to put in place contemporary legislative and legal framework in the oil and gas sector has proved abortive since the year 2000; also, the non-amendment of the extant framework being the Petroleum Act of 1967, has affected the inflow of foreign direct investment as well as growth in local content.\n\n\u201cBreaking this jinx and achieving this feat is a testament that the executive and the legislature can really work together and truly engage each other, without compromising party position and individual perspective, in the most positive manner with a view to actualizing the common goal and communal good for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, the House of Representatives y passed the PIB.\n\nIt considered and adopted the report on the PIB for passage during its committee of the whole session.\n\nThe adoption, followed the consideration of all the 318 clauses of the bill, presented by Chairman of the Ad-hoc Committee on the PIB, Hon. Mohammed Monguno.\n\nMoving the motion for the consideration, Monguno said by passing the bill into law, the House would have written its name in gold.\n\nThe 318 clauses of the bill were put to a voice vote by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase and they were unanimously adopted by the lawmakers.\n\nSpeaking after the consideration of the report, the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, hailed the House for achieving the feat.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to commend the 24 wise men and the 360 members in producing this 318 sections law. In the coming week, the electoral amendment will follow suit. By the time we are done, irrespective of which side of the divide you are on, this 9th House would have done us proud and recorded on the right side of the law.\u201d\n\nBut Monguno later told reporters that contrary to what has already been reported by the media, the bill had not been passed but was considered and adopted by the committee of the whole.\n\nBut his clarification confirmed that the lawmakers may have skipped the third reading stage to pass the bill\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Bill has suffered over the years in previous assemblies. But this time around, the 9th House of Representatives decided to take the bull by the horn and passed the bill. We decided to pass it with the speed of light because of the urgency it demands. Nigeria has lost a lot in terms of direct foreign investment in our oil and gas industry, as a result of obsolete laws affecting the oil and gas industry. In abroad their oil and gas laws is in tandem with international best practices.\u201d\n\nHe added that the bill will now be scheduled for third reading and final passage and then referred to the Buhari for assent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe federal government is projecting N900 billion for fuel subsidy in an estimated N11.907 trillion budget for 2022.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said at a public presentation of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP) yesterday in Abuja that at least N900 billion was being projected for fuel subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe minister lamented that subsidy is exerting huge cost on the country, adding that in a particular month, N150 billion was spent on subsidising petrol.\n\nShe said: \u201cRight now, we are subsidising consumption in Nigeria. We sell at N165 per litre when our neighbours are selling at N500 per litre. It is only the marketers that are benefiting by taking this product from Nigeria and selling it across borders. The common man is not benefiting.\n\n\u201cThe transition is not an easy one if we have to remove the subsidy. What are the alternatives? What can we provide for citizens? So we are projecting if we will be paying at least N900 billion subsidy for next year.\u201d\n\nAhmed regretted that the huge amount being channelled into subsidy could have been available in the Federation Account and shared to provide education, infrastructure and lead to a reduction in government borrowing.\n\n\u201cWe will reduce our borrowing. We will increase the amounts that states and local governments are collecting. We are being penny wise, pound foolish to think that by giving this subsidy that citizens are benefitting. But at the end of the day, the citizens are actually the ones that are carrying the brunt of the wealthy.\n\n\u201cSome have two, three, four cars and they are the ones that we are subsidising. It is not helping the farmer who needs a bus from his farm to the market. But if we get rid of subsidy completely, it is not a popular view with labour,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nThe minister listed the key parameters for the 2022 budget to include a deficit of N5.6 trillion, an oil benchmark price of $57 per barrel, an N410.15 to the dollar exchange rate and oil production of 1.88 million barrels per day.\n\nThe budget is also to be anchored on a 13 per cent inflation rate and a 2.3 per cent gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nOn the funding of the N5.6 trillion deficit, Ahmed said it would be done through borrowing from both domestic and foreign sources at 50 per cent.\n\nDebt service obligations are also projected at N3.6 trillion.\n\nAhmed stated that the draft 2022-2024 MTEF/FSP has been prepared against the backdrop of the global economic recovery amidst improved vaccination outlook and lower incidence of infection.\n\nHowever, the minister said the MTEF showed that there were continuing global challenges in the aftermath of the COVID-19.\n\nOn measures to address the increasing government overdraft from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through the apex bank\u2019s \u2018ways and means\u2019 window, the minister stated that by next year, the government would securitise the debt owed to the bank.\n\nAccording to her, from next year, the federal government will stay within the five per cent limit provided by the CBN Act and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA).\n\nOn the 2021 budget performance, Ahmed said a total of N973 billion had been released for capital projects as of May.\n\nReacting to a question on the rising deficit, the Minister of State for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, said the deficit was trending down with the increase in revenue and reduction in operating costs.\n\nHe said the federal government was conscious of growing revenue sources, especially in the non-oil sector, adding that it is pursuing diversification of its earnings from oil to non-oil.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) yesterday failed to agree on whether or not to keep crude oil output at current levels or open the taps for a further easing of production quotas by roughly two million barrels between now and December.\n\nEarlier, there were expectations that the cartel could boost production output by another 400,000 barrels beginning in August, an increase seen as likely to be easily absorbed by the market amid expectations for rising demand.\n\nIt was gathered that the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMCC) failed to come to a conclusion on the recommendations and will meet again today to iron out the rough edges.\n\nAt the inconclusive meeting, the OPEC+ ministerial committee had proposed the planned increase to the wider group, but a disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia, the biggest producers in the OPEC+ alliance, remained largely unresolved.\n\nLast year, following the death-blow, dealt on the oil market by the COVID-19 pandemic, OPEC+ resolved to cut output by almost 10 million bpd from May 2020, with plans to phase out the curbs by the end of April 2022.\n\nBefore the deferment of the meeting, oil prices reacted with Brent crude trading above $75 a barrel, close to a two-and-a-half-year high as the policy from August to December was being awaited.\n\nWhile the full house decided to shift a definitive decision on the matter till today, OPEC had earlier finished its meeting just before an OPEC+ ministerial committee met after that, before the inconclusive one by OPEC+ ministers.\n\nThe Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of OPEC had a day earlier stated that it expected oil demand to grow by six million bpd in 2021 but flagged risks of a glut in 2022, saying there were \u201csignificant uncertainties\u201d including an uneven global recovery and rising cases of the Delta variant of Coronavirus.\n\nSources close to the meeting said the idea of a gradual increase featured in both policy drafts put forward for the vote at the ministerial meeting, while one of the proposals suggested extending the coalition\u2019s output restraint deal until the end of 2022.\n\nRussia hinted that it viewed the current oil price of around $75 per barrel as a sign of overheating, prompting Moscow to support a further increase of production by the group, with Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Alexander Novak, saying that prices in a range of $45-$60/bbl would be optimal.\n\nOne of the factors that could shape the decision today is the status of talks between Iran and the U.S., which are seeking to revive their nuclear pact and potentially lift sanctions on the Islamic Republic\u2019s oil exports.\n\nSpeaking during one of the sessions, the Secretary-General of OPEC, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, had urged members to be watchful of the pace of the global vaccination rollout versus the speed of COVID-19 variants taking hold.\n\nHe, however, stated that OPEC still sees growth in the second half of the year.\n\nOn the supply side, Barkindo reiterated that non-OPEC liquids production in 2021 is forecast to grow by 0.8 mb/d, a drop of 0.1 mb/d from the number presented in November 2020.\n\nHe said OPEC member-countries and all Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) participants had contributed to the rebound and recovery since November last year, with overall conformity levels consistently over 100 per cent.\n\nHe added that the administering of three billion doses of vaccine against COVID-19 worldwide represents an unprecedented achievement in the history of medical science, combined with the effects of around $26 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus in some countries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "MAN IN THE NEWS: Sunday Igboho, the Nnamdi Kanu of south-west?",
          "text": "It all started with anger, one birthed by the weight of the responsibility he felt to keep his people safe. The attacks and killings happened non-stop and when Igboho could no longer take it, he took the law into his own hands! In a short time, Igboho became the self-acclaimed defender of the afflicted Yoruba people \u2014 as well as the centre of national and international attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCall him the Nnamdi Kanu of the south-west \u2014 what the IPOB leader claims to be to the Igbo of the south-east it appears Igboho is, or wants to be, to the Yoruba of the south-west. Both men, who are self-acclaimed messiahs of the people they want to redeem, have hinged their rebellion on allegations of injustice and marginalisation \u2014 and are both seeking the secession of their people from the Nigerian nation.\n\nOn Thursday, suspected gunmen attacked Igboho\u2019s house at the Soka area of Ibadan, destroying cars and other valuables in the process. The attack, which came two days to a \u201cYoruba nation rally\u201d Igboho slated for Lagos, has put him in the spotlight. But this is not the first time Igboho will be making news headlines.\n\nTHE EVICTION NOTICE TO FULANI HERDERS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIgboho, whose real name is Sunday Adeyemo, came into prominence when he stormed Ibarapa local government of Oyo state in January and asked Fulani herdsmen to vacate the area, blaming them for the killing and kidnapping of Yoruba indigenes. His eviction notice sparked off a number of events that will eventually lead to an order by the inspector-general of police for his arrest.\n\nIgboho turned a deaf ear to calls from both state and non-state actors, including Seyi Makinde, the state governor, asking him to stand down. In a bid to effect the notice, some youths in the area took the law into their own hands and wreaked havoc on the Fulani residents of the area. The home and property of Saliu Abdulkadir, Sarkin Fulani of Oyo state, were set ablaze and lives were lost in the mayhem that ensued.\n\nAGITATION FOR YORUBA NATION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a viral video that surfaced in March, Igboho declared that the Yoruba are no longer part of Nigeria.\n\nIgboho also asked the Yoruba in the north to return home and end their \u201dsuffering\u201d, adding that all the borders \u2014 which were closed by the federal government at that time \u2014 will be opened.\n\n\u201cWe no longer have peace in our home. We have a good country but our leaders are bad. We don\u2019t want them again,\u201d he had said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter this discussion, we will hold meeting and open our borders so that rice, food and other things can enter easily. Enough is enough. All our borders that Nigerian government closed, we are telling them we are no longer under them, we will go and open the borders.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for everything they want to do to us. I am speaking on behalf of Yoruba people.\u201d\n\nIn May, when he joined his supporters in Osogbo, Osun state capital, for a pro-Yoruba nation rally, Igboho said he had the support of the governors of the south-west region for the creation of a Yoruba nation.\n\nYoruba elders and some governors have, however, disowned Igboho\u2019s secession bid, saying they have invested so much in the country to watch it disintegrate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also took his campaign to Ogun state in February where he said he will visit all of Yorubaland to flush out killer herdsmen and ensure there is peace.\n\nATTACKS ON HIS HOUSES\n\nThursday\u2019s attack on Igboho\u2019s house is not the first. One of his houses in the area was allegedly set on fire by gunmen who invaded the residence on January 26, 2021. Igboho said at the time those who set the house on fire were loyalists of Fulani herders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn April 26, 2021, his second house, also located in Soka area, was also attacked.\n\nAdesina Akinpelu, one of Igboho\u2019s aides, told TheCable in February that operatives of different security agencies intercepted the convoy in which Igboho was travelling along Lagos-Ibadan expressway.\n\nAkinpelu said the security operatives claimed they wanted to arrest a \u201ccriminal\u201d, but did not mention Igboho\u2019s name.\n\nThe DSS, nonetheless, denied the report that its men attempted to arrest him.\n\n\u2018MYSTICAL IGBOHO\u2019\n\nIgboho is alleged to possess mystical powers which shield him from harm. He is also reported to take the forms of animals when in imminent danger. This claim is unsubstantiated.\n\nA friend of Igboho who grew up with him in the Modakeke area of Oke Ogun told TheCable in an interview that said it is true that he (Igboho) possesses metaphysical powers, adding that Igboho\u2019s grandfather might have transferred it to his grandson.\n\n\u201cThe metaphysical power he has is beyond imagination\u2026 his grandfather was known to possess some powers. Everyone who lived in the town before his death would know of the power of Sunday\u2019s grandfather,\u201d he said.\n\nIgboho also said in February though his family is concerned about his safety, no one can kill him.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid of anything or anyone but God. God is the owner and controller of every soul. It is only God who can kill me. No human being can kill me, so I cannot be afraid of any mortal,\u201d he said.\n\nIn \u2018Sunday Igboho\u2019, a three-part Yoruba movie released in 2017 chronicling the life of the youth leader, Igboho is depicted as a warrior who possesses metaphysical powers.\n\n\u201cRight from the womb, Sunday proves powerful by changing his sex to a male from the female predestined by the Osun Priestess. His father wanted him to be educated but Sunday chooses the path of a warrior,\u201d its synopsis said.\n\nNOW WANTED BY THE DSS\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) has declared Igboho wanted after he escaped arrest when the secret police raided his residence.\n\nAccording to Peter Afunanya, DSS spokesman, the security agency recovered illegal arms \u2014 including seven AK-47 rifles \u2014 and thousands of ammunition from Igboho\u2019s house during the raid.\n\nThe development comes days after Nnamdi Kanu was caught, extradited and remanded in the custody of the DSS.\n\nWhile Kanu\u2019s run from the DSS may be over, Igboho\u2019s may have just begun!",

          "title": "TeamApt closes undisclosed Series B round to extend its banking services across Africa",
          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "Faith Keza is leading Irembo to fully digitise Rwanda",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were living in Rwanda today and needed to get a government-issued certificate, you can simply fill out some forms and make your payment \u2013 all online. Your certificate will be sent to your inbox when ready.\n\nIrembo is leading this digitisation of services in Rwanda. And steering the Irembo ship is Faith Keza.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 pm in Lagos when we sit to talk over Google Meet. Due to scheduling conflicts, our conversation had been delayed for some weeks but I was excited to be speaking with her.\n\nAfter getting her degree from MIT, she worked at Oracle, Delphix, Google and is now the CEO of Irembo. Faith is also on the board of the Rwanda National Bank and the Rwanda Development Board.\n\nSo how is she able to do all this? In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor one child to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top students in the country and in the end, Faith Keza and another student were on their way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking. In 2018 and 2019, she was nominated to be on the boards of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).\n\nOn these boards, she does a lot of things including consulting on the state of tech in the country and how the country can work towards their digital goals.\n\nBased on her hobbies, it\u2019s likely that Faith is looking forward to spending more time reading, making recipes from the internet, or watching Netflix \u2013 after they put out some new shows because she insists she has watched all the good ones.\n\nAnd now, as CEO of Irembo, the goal is to expand. With the largest growing youth population in the world, a digitised Africa will be a sight to behold.\n\nWith Faith Keza, Irembo could be at the front of that movement.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In a fashion typical of African governments, authorities in the Kingdom of Eswatini have ordered network providers in the country to cut off access to the internet as a nationwide protest continues to rock the small southern African kingdom.\n\nDemonstrations demanding reforms to the country\u2019s absolute monarchy started during the weekend and things turned violent overnight on Tuesday as security forces fired gunshots and tear gas to disperse protesters, multiple reports show.\n\nActivists in the country are demanding democratic reforms and the lifting of bans on all opposition parties. They have said they will intensify demonstrations against the government, which have been on for four consecutive days now.\n\nVideos of people burning tires, throwing stones at cars, and barricading streets in cities like Manzini and Matsapha have also been circulating on social media.\n\nProtestors block roads in Manzini, King Mswati\u2019s Government blocks internet to control situation. pic.twitter.com/Pk9ao9duio \u2014 Swazi News (@SwaziNews) June 29, 2021\n\nEswatini protestors now operating at night burning businesses linked to King Mswati and Government properties.

Banks have also closed up until the unrest subsides.\n\nGovernment has further suspended schools & introduced a 6pm-5am curfew with immediate effect. Acting Prime Minister: \u201cAll offices should be closed by 3:30pm to allow workers to get home safely while essential workers will be required to produce a permit when travelling at night.\u201d \u2014 Eswatini Government (@EswatiniGovern1) June 29, 2021\n\nAnd in addition to these, the government has blocked the internet, according to several reports.\n\nESWATINI GOVT orders major network providers to cut internet connection, closes schools, imposes 6pm-5am curfew as protests continue. pic.twitter.com/wtMIEzte6u \u2014 Nation Breaking News (@NationBreaking) June 29, 2021\n\nOver the past few years, Africa has been plagued by social media and internet shutdowns in the run-up to elections and in response to protests or dissent.\n\nBetween January 2020 and February 2021, internet and social media blackouts were imposed in Uganda, Chad, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Nigeria restricted access to Twitter on June 4, albeit under different circumstances.\n\nInternet blocks on the continent prevent access to social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. In what is a worrying trend, local activists and international observers note that these blocks curtail the democratic right of freedom of speech and expression.\n\nAnger against Africa\u2019s last absolute monarch\n\nA former British protectorate, Eswatini is Africa\u2019s last absolute monarchy and one of the few remaining in the world. King Mswati III has ruled by decree for more than three decades, with unfettered political power over his 1 million people.\n\nThe royal family has come under fire for their lavish spending while most inhabitants, who are subsistence farmers, live below the poverty line. Crowned in 1986 when he was just 18, the king currently has 15 wives who occupy several state-funded palaces.\n\nThe small landlocked country changed its name from Swaziland in 2018, a move that was seen as a step towards democracy. However, King Mswati III has reportedly been running a repressive government, with several reported cases of human rights abuse, and consistently evaded years-long calls for meaningful democratic reforms.\n\nDespite anger towards Mswati over the years, demonstrations have not been commonplace in Eswatini. This is because the kingdom has continually stifled dissent and protests, as well as banned political parties from participating in parliamentary elections since 1973. Still, the 53-year-old monarch has denied being an autocrat.\n\nSeveral opposition leaders and activists were arrested in 2019, the same year when civil servants in the country went on several strike actions, accusing the monarch of draining public coffers at the expense of his subjects.\n\nThe series of crackdowns has done little to discourage anti-monarchy sentiment among the people as they continue to demand a democratic government that will serve their interests. This culminated in the ongoing anti-monarchy demonstrations in many parts of the country.\n\nAmid the protests, reports say the king has fled to neighbouring South Africa although Eswatini\u2019s acting Prime Minister, Themba Masuku, denied the claims on Tuesday. It\u2019s unclear at the moment what the situation is in the country but the internet shutdown is only likely to worsen the crisis.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

The co-founder says it is to \u201cmake history and appeal to Islamic investors to participate in the issuance.\u201d\n\nOne company, several partners\n\nIn describing OWS\u2019s business model, Adeojo says it\u2019s like Uber, but for energy services.\n\n\u201cWe partner with a lot of solar companies across the continent that carry out installation and maintenance. What we do is to provide the hardware like, solar panels, inverters, and software to enable the hardware run seamlessly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are some of the software used by OWS to facilitate services like payments and monitoring.\n\nBreaking down the process of how OWS operates, Adeojo says there are brokers that source for clients and solar companies that install hardware.\n\nThrough this model he claims, the company creates jobs for young engineers.\n\nSupervised by the solar companies, these engineers can also be part of the installation process individually. In addition, they\u2019ll also be in charge of maintenance, meaning they\u2019ll keep earning as long as the installed hardware is in use.\n\nThe vision of the renewable energy company is to deploy 14,000 megawatts of off-grid renewable energy across sub-Saharan Africa to decarbonise the region\u2019s energy sector.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN) Fact Sheet on Climate Change, \u201cAfrica is the continent\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,\u201d with 0.8 metric tons of carbon emissions per capita in the year 2000.\n\nHowever, Adeojo says OWS has partnered with solar companies and installers to deploy over 50 megawatts of renewable energy across Nigeria.\n\nWith this issuance, the company can accelerate its vision of installing 14,000 megawatts of clean energy in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first time an African startup has resorted to bonds for funding, it\u2019s a relatively new phenomenon.

He was approached by Steve Baxter, \u2018Shark\u2019 on Shark Tank, and an Australian serial entrepreneur who founded SENet and Pipe Networks, which was acquired for about $400 million.\n\nBaxter had started investing in technology startups through his family\u2019s office, Transition Level Investments, but wanted to do more and so he tapped Glynn. Together, they invested in about 40 ventures around the world.\n\nIn December 2019, after wondering how to institutionalise their investments, Baxter and Glynn decided to start TEN13. Having seen the value that Baxter could bring with his experience as a founder, they chose to do things differently.\n\nRather than raise a seed fund, TEN13 has a network of over 200 entrepreneurs and corporate executives who supply more than funds to the startups that they invest in. These investors provide the companies with an extensive network and advice as they navigate their startup journeys. Investments at TEN13 are made on a deal by deal basis.\n\nSince its launch in the last 18 months, TEN13 has deployed about $20 million in 13 startups, including Australian edtech unicorn, Go1; fintech startup, ImaliPay; and Africa- focused fintech unicorn, Chipper Cash.\n\nAccording to Glynn, the idea is to get behind visionary founders at the earliest stage and provide them with the resources to take their companies to the next level. The average ticket size is between $250,000 and $1 million, with the possibility of more investment further down the road.\n\nOn bad investments and common mistakes founders make\n\nFor now, Glynn explains that the goal is to fund ten companies every year. An arduous task, as he claims they get about 70 to 80 startups looking for funding monthly. When I asked if there were any deals they had missed out on that hurt, he explained it is the norm in venture capital.\n\n\u201cIn our game, it\u2019s really about having a framework for decision making because as early-stage investors, you\u2019re making decisions with limited data. As an investor, you want to see a lot of companies in the anti-portfolio because that means you are seeing the right deals,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn investor\u2019s anti-portfolio are the deals which they pursued but did not invest in, either of their own volition or because other investors shut them out.\n\nAccording to research, nine out of 10 startups fail. Knowing this, I asked Glynn how TEN13 deals with investments that do not go according to plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as a bad investment. We understand that while the companies we back have a high potential for success, there\u2019re a lot of reasons why startups fail. When we invest in startups, we provide support for the founders to ensure that the startups have a good chance of success,\u201d he says.\n\nMost founders have grand plans to take on the world at the early stage, but without previous startup experience, they are likely to make mistakes. Glynn advises that this is the point when they need to narrow their focus and not spread themselves too thin \u2014 something they make sure these startups know.\n\nInstead, he advises that they identify one thing that would put them on the right path and focus on doing it for the next three to six months.\n\nHow to reach TEN13\n\nFor founders looking to get TEN13 on board as investors, he recommends that they reach out via email [email protected] or LinkedIn. He stresses that they are sector-agnostic and back founders who are building products for a global market. With a renewed focus on emerging markets, he recommends that founders in these markets building remarkable products should reach out to him.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nGlobal tech giants commit to keeping women safe online\n\nMTN Uganda partners with TIP\n\nKenya plans to increase the cost of airtime and data\n\nGlobal tech giants to keep women and girls safe\n\nWhat happened? The United Nations announced yesterday, July 1, 2020, at its Generation Equality Forum in Paris, the public commitment of the world\u2019s largest tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Twitter \u2014 to make their platforms safer for women.\n\nThe public commitment is to address online abuse against women and promote gender equality by introducing new systems or upgrading existing ones to make reporting abuse more effortless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the World Wide Web Foundation began the initiative more than a year ago to bring stakeholders together to solve the challenge.\n\nAccording to Eve Kraicer, Policy Officer, Gender and Data Rights at the World Wide Web Foundation, during the period, the Foundation brought together 120 experts from tech companies, civil societies, academia, and governments from 35 countries to co-create solutions and prototypes to combat online abuse.\n\nThe Foundation will track the companies based on their commitments and receive annual progress reports.\n\nBut the world interacts with the Internet differently, right? Well, Kraicer assured that the solutions developed will consider how women in various parts of the world engage with the Internet.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nMTN Uganda partners with TIP to build 5G Technology\n\nMTN Uganda has partnered with members under the Telecom Infra Project (TIP), an engineering-focused community, to automate its network preparation for 5G technology.\n\nWhy the partnership? MTN Uganda will use TIP\u2019s Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway (DCSG) technology to build network capabilities at 2,500 locations across Uganda. Because of this, MTN\u2019s network will be able to transition to 5G effortlessly.\n\nAccording to Al Monzer, MTN Uganda\u2019s Chief Technical Officer (CTO), the DCSG technology provides a faster transport network for all telecommunication traffic across networks, including phone calls, data, messages, mobile money, and digital services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? The CTO claims that DCSG technology could allow you to connect a phone call in a few milliseconds and allow cost-effective and efficient running of a far larger automated end-to-end network.\n\nAfrica\u2019s first? Uganda would reportedly be the first African country to implement this technology. In Europe and North America, the DCSG technology has been in use for quite some time.\n\nRemember that, in 2019, MTN Uganda began a new initiative committed to developing 5G technology as part of an ongoing transformation across its operations.\n\nSimilar? The Nigerian Senate, in May 2021, approved plans for 5G deployment in the country despite controversies surrounding it.\n\nTelecom service provider, Aviat Network, will manage the deployment of Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway technology in Uganda through Network Operating Software.\n\nKenya plans to increase the cost of airtime and data\n\nThe Kenyan Parliamentary Committee has proposed additional taxes that will increase the cost of airtime and Internet data services.\n\nThe National Assembly\u2019s Finance and National Planning Committee plans to have the taxman raid Internet service providers and mobile phone firms for additional taxes, according to modifications to the Finance Bill 2021, which has been sent to the Legislative Council for approval.\n\nWhat does this mean for Kenyans? Kenyans should brace themselves for an increase in Internet fees in the coming days if the Committee approves the proposal. By making this change, the tax on phone and Internet data service fees would go up from 15% to 20%.\n\nWhy? Lately, there are more people online in Kenya than ever before. Taxing Kenyans will reportedly generate short-term revenue for the government, which is having trouble coming up with ways to pay more than $33 billion in debt (Sh3.6 trillion).\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising is how the Parliament reduced betting excise taxes from 20% to 7.5% of the amount staked or wagered on gaming after proposing to increase taxes on Internet services.\n\nI believe that data is a lucrative cash cow for tax collectors because it enables them to collect large sums of money through various government services, including driver\u2019s licences, resulting in the cost of airtime.\n\nSimilar? 51 African countries have excise on airtime charges. In 2020, Nigeria increased voice and SMS tariffs, with the implementation of Value Added Tax (VAT), from 5% to 7.5%.\n\nWill the Committee pass the bill into law? Just like Nigeria passed the VAT bill into law, I think Kenya will do the same. What do you think?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nGoogle sold $2.5 Million in AI to the Pentagon for its Covid-19 Recovery. Read.\n\nTwitter considers letting you limit tweets to \u2018trusted friends\u2019. Read.\n\n5 Major Reasons Religion Is the No.1 Cause of Poverty in Africa.

          "title": "Nigerian stocks lag African peers, but some superstars exist",
          "text": "After ending the year 2020 with a record 50 percent gain, the Nigerian stock market has been unable to sustain the momentum in the first half of 2021 as investors\u2019 appetite for stocks continues to wane on rising yields.\n\nCompared with peers, Nigerian stocks have underperformed with a YTD (year-to date) performance of -5.9 percent as against Ghana, Kenya and South Africa whose stocks were up 36.3 percent, 14 percent and 11.53 percent, respectively, in the first half of the year.\n\nYinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance, explains that unlike last year when interest rates were low and investors had to troop into the stock market, they have moved out this year as interest rates continue to rise.\n\nDespite the inflation rate that has slowed for the second successive month in May and oil price that touched its highest since 2018 at $76, it has been unable to spur investor\u2019s appetite for Nigerian equities as they are more interested in the fixed income space.\n\nHowever, while some companies have seen their share plunge significantly in the first half, some shares have rewarded investors with eye-popping gains.\n\nHere are the best performing stocks in the first half of 2020\n\nLASACO Assurance\n\nLASACO\u2019s share price is the best performer as it stormed 329 percent higher in the first half of 2021 (H1 2021). The insurance and financial service company opened the year with a share price of N0.35 and rose to N1.50 as at June 3oth 2021.\n\nMorison Industries\n\nMorison\u2019s share price came next with a 186 percent gain in H1 2021. Morison began the year with a share price of N0.49 per share and closed its last trading day in June at N1.40 per share, ranking it second-best on the Nigerian exchange group in year-to-date performance.\n\nMorison Industries plc specialises in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical, hygiene and care products.\n\nRead also: International Breweries declares N 136.8bn revenue\n\nChampion Breweries\n\nThe Champion breweries share price came next with 144 percent gain. The beer maker\u2019s share opened the year at N0.86 and jumped to N2.1 as at June 30th 2021.\n\nSince Heineken\u2019s indirect acquisition of additional shares in Champion Breweries through Raysun Nigeria Limited on the 8th of January 2021, buying interest by investors have continued to prop the shares of the company.\n\nRoyal Exchange\n\nThe share price of Royal Exchange, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost financial services groups offering general and health insurance, also gained by 135 percent in H1 2021. The insurer\u2019s share price began the year at N0.26 and has surged to N0.61 in the review period.\n\nRegency Alliance Insurance\n\nRegency Alliance ranked the fifth best performer in H1 2021 with 109 percent gain. The insurance company began the year with a share price of N0.22 and surged to N0.46 per share on the last day of June 2021.\n\nVitafoam\n\nVitafoam\u2019s share price recorded a 97 percent gain in the first half of the year. The manufacturer of foam products saw its share price rise to N15.4 per share compared to N7.8 per share at the beginning of the year.\n\nConsolidated Hallmark\n\nConsolidated Hallmark Insurance\u2019s share price also gained 88 percent in the first half of 2021. The insurer\u2019s share price opened the year at N0.32, surging to N0.60 as of 30 June 2021.\n\nSeplat\n\nSeplat shares have gained 72 percent, ranking it 8th among the top performers in terms of year-to-date performance.\n\nAs oil prices continue to rebound, investor\u2019s buying interest resumed and this pushed Seplat\u2019s shares up to N690 per share as at June 30th 2021 from an opening price of N402 per share.\n\nLinkage Assurance\n\nLINKASSURE began the year with a share price of N0.52 and has since gained 61.54 percent on that price valuation, ranking it 9th on the NSE in terms of year-to-date performance. This stock gained 40 percent in the last one month alone\n\nMutual Benefits Assurance\n\nMBenefit ranked the 10th on the NSE in terms of year-to-date performance with 59.26 percent gain. The insurance company began the year with a share price of N0.27 and surged to N0.43 per share as at June 30th 2021.\n\nOther stocks that outperformed the NSE year-to-date return\n\nWhile some stocks did not make the top 10 list, they have outperformed the NSE year-to-date return -5.9 percent. These stocks include McNichols (56.86%), Guinness (52.63%), Eterna (47%), WAPIC (42.5%) and Honeywell Flour Mill (39.17%).\n\nOutlook for H2\n\nOn the outlook for the second half of the year, investment analysts have projected that investors might flock back if companies post impressive half-year performance and for dividend benefits.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for equities in the second half is not very positive, the only catalyst for a slight rebound might be positive earnings by companies which could stimulate investors interest,\u201d an equity analyst who prefers anonymity says.\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital, a Lagos-based investment house, have also projected that investors might flock back to reap dividend benefits.\n\n\u201cDespite the yield retracement in the fixed income market, we do not think investors should give up on the possibility of a market rally in the second half of the year as we still see scope for positive market performance.\n\n\u201cGiven that the second half of the year is associated with the declaration of interim dividends, we envisage that investors will flock into stocks with attractive dividend yields as we inch closer to the half-year earnings season,\u201d they note.",

          "title": "BusinessDay @ 20: Going strong like the way we started",
          "text": "BusinessDay is 20 years old today. This newspaper, which is now the primus inter pares, announced its entry into the global financial journalism space exactly 20 years ago today.\n\nWith a strong ambition to change the economy, financial, business and industry narratives in Nigeria and the West African sub-region for the better, a carefully constituted five-member board comprising Pat Utomi as chairman, Frank Aigbogun (publisher/CEO), Alhaji Ibrahim Ida and Abiola Otaniyi as members, and Akinniyi Sowumi as the pioneer editor, BusinessDay on July 1, 2001, started a journey that today has made it the premium source of business and financial news and market intelligence for local and foreign investors across West Africa.\n\nOver that 20-year period, the publication has continued to seek to deliver the promise it set out at the start, as articulated by the pioneer chairman, Pat Utomi.\n\nRead Also: BusinessDay, NSE hold Nigerian Investor Value Awards today\n\nOn the front page of that historical publication, which we have reproduced the cover in this edition, Utomi wrote: \u201cAll great societies, as all outstanding enterprises, are the end result of a great idea. Ideas do not grow in the void. Often they come from bringing the intellect into the path of the flow of quality information, news, analysis and hard statistical data that BusinessDay promises to deliver.\u201d\n\nIn this 20th year, we are proud of the history we created and are part of as we have not only chronicled the very best of business stories in the period but shaped policies, shared insights, and converged the best global thought leaders in our conferences. Though coming out of the most disruptive economic and technology shifts in human history following Covid-19, we are as excited about the future that we see as we are so proud of the past that birthed us.\n\nAs we celebrate 20 years of impact journalism in Nigeria, many things have changed, while many things remain the way they were. Perhaps nothing symbolizes that the Nigerian economy has not changed in dramatic ways like the stories we carried in our first edition. Indeed, the first headline was \u201cGoods inspection cripples Benin Republic\u201d, written by Seidi Mulero. The story focused on the impact of the full inspection policy that covered land, sea and air on the level of patronage of ports in Benin Republic, a story that we believe will resonate with those that believe, even 20 years after, that Nigeria continues to fail to find a workable solution to the single West African market.\n\nAlso in the same edition, the central feature was on \u201cFaces of (Nigeria\u2019s) battered currency\u201d, showing that the story of the naira\u2019s weakness did not start in the last six years. Twenty years ago, though oil prices were rising, the country grappled with severe balance of payment problems, epitomized by the staggering over $30 billion debt.\n\nOther stories in the first edition were no less symptomatic of the way we have covered business since. Oluwole Elisha wrote \u201cBanks reject foreign exchange requests\u201d, exposing how banks rejected requests for foreign exchange from their customers as a demand management approach by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through the banks.\n\nAnother banking-related story in the first edition was the declaration of N1.25 billion profit by the then Intercontinental Bank Plc headed by Erastus Akingbola. The story was written by Remi Njoku. Intercontinental Bank ran into trouble in 2009 after a special audit of the commercial banks in Nigeria by the Central Bank (CBN) listed it among nine banks found to be under-capitalized and badly managed. Intercontinental Bank was later taken over by Access Bank in 2013.\n\nAbba Kyari, the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, was celebrated in BusinessDay\u2019s maiden edition as that day coincided with his return to the United Bank for Africa (UBA) as vice chairman. The appointment came shortly after he retired as the managing director and chief executive of the same bank.\n\nThe strong presence of indigenous Nigerian banks on the African continent owes its success to the policy implemented in early 2000\u2019s which was the focus of the maiden edition of this newspaper. Writing for the Finance Beat with the headline \u201cBanks go for strong hands\u201d, Remi Njoku reported how banks had shifted attention to quality-oriented and well-trained staff in a bid to raise their standard to global standard.\n\nOther epic stories in the maiden edition focused on the different sectors and players in the Nigerian economy and the global developments as at that time.\n\n\u201cIs Coke losing flavour?\u201d was another important story that featured in BusinessDay\u2019s maiden publication. It was written by Anthony Osae-Brown, who later rose through the ranks to become the editor of the newspaper.\n\nThe maiden publication also featured Virgin Atlantic\u2019s maiden flight into Nigeria. Headlined \u201cA flight of Virgin\u201d, the story written by John Osadolor, now the deputy editor and head of BusinessDay\u2019s Abuja office, projected that Virgin Atlantic would challenge British Airways on the Lagos-London route with lower fares.\n\nThere was a photograph of Musiliu Smith, the then Inspector General of Police, and Gaius Obaseki, who was then the group managing director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), conferring with each other. Undoubtedly, the two institutions headed by both men, then and now, remain very sensitive in Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay also reported that \u201cNNPC reviews cash call payment\u201d in the maiden edition. \u201cThis move, it was learnt, is the apex oil industry authority\u2019s plan to reduce delay in payment of cash calls and avoid losses to government,\u201d the report said.\n\nAs a follow-up, BusinessDay also carried a story on why the country\u2019s oil and gas sector had not witnessed much progress. It was an interview with Chamberlin Oyibo conducted by Olusola Bello. Oyibo, in the interview titled \u201cGovernment interests derail oil industry\u201d, identified government running of oil and gas business as against providing policy guidance as the bane of the nation\u2019s oil and gas development.\n\nFrom first edition also, BusinessDay\u2019s Africa ambitions were clear. There was a section on Africa where the newspaper asked the question: \u201cWho speaks for Africa?\u201d A lot has since changed positively for the African continent with the elections of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian, as director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), and Ngozi-Okonjo Iweala, a Nigerian, as director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), who are currently projecting the image of Africa on the global scene.\n\nMany things have also changed within. BusinessDay has since migrated from a then weekly publication to a daily publication, and today it is accessible through print, online, and mobile. And we have led some of those changes.\n\nBusinessDay has always sought to provide contexts and empower you, our reader, with the information required to make your business decisions.",

          "text": "Between 1958 and 1962, an estimated 40 million people starved to death in China as a result of the largest socialist experiment in history.\n\nMao Zedong, who was the leader of China, had called this experiment the \u201cGreat Leap Forward,\u201d which was aimed at rapidly transforming the economy from agrarian to industrial, but for China it was a disaster. What was supposed to create wealth for the people had impoverished them like never before.\n\nPrivate farming was abolished and rural farmers were forced to work on collective farms where all production, resource allocation, and food distribution was centrally controlled by the Communist Party.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was officially halted in January 1961 after three brutal years of death and destruction.\n\nRead Also: How China, India, Vietnam lifted millions out of poverty\n\nThe outcome of the experiment was predictable, because it matched the pattern of events unfolding in the \u201cterror famine\u201d of Ukraine in 1932, and in the Soviet Union in 1933, events that exposed the shortcomings of socialism and the government\u2019s omnipotent grip over an economy.\n\nChina had a rebirth after Deng Xiaoping rose to power in China and implemented a series of far-reaching market-economy reforms that fostered private ownership of property, boosted economic growth, created jobs and reduced poverty.\n\nBy 1983, the process of de-collectivising Chinese agriculture was almost complete. Mao\u2019s great socialist experiment, which had cost so many millions of lives, was over.\n\nInitially, the growth in private ownership across China was driven by increasing numbers of small-scale entrepreneurs setting up businesses, which were only allowed to employ a maximum of seven people. The increasing erosion of this socialist system that exclusively permitted public ownership under the management of a state-run economic planning authority was accelerated by the creation of Special Economic Areas.\n\nChina has been the better for its encouragement of private enterprise. Poverty has reduced from nearly 90 percent in 1980 to under 2 percent, according to latest World Bank figures, lifting over 800 million out of poverty in the process.\n\nRead Also: Buhari\u2019s denialism will compound the poverty crisis\n\nThe lesson here for a country like Nigeria, which is grappling with high levels of poverty, is that creating an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive while reducing the role of government in the economy may be the best way out of deepening poverty.\n\nWith 87 million Nigerians living in poverty, Nigeria is home to the highest number of poor people globally. The World Bank even predicts that the number will increase by another 7 million by year-end. That means that by the end of 2021, Nigerians living below $1.90 per day could rise to 94 million, that is the population of the United Kingdom and Australia combined.\n\nThe government in 2019 announced an ambitious plan to lift 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years.\n\nThe big question however is if the government is doing the right things to achieve this target. China, for one, was able to achieve such a feat but Nigeria is not exactly following in the steps of China by increasingly liberalising the economy and encouraging private enterprise.\n\nIf anything, the Nigerian government is seemingly tightening its grip on the economy when it should be giving the private sector a bigger role to play.\n\nThere are examples.\n\nThe state-owned oil company is now the sole importer of petroleum products into the country, displacing private importers who have been unable to sustain imports due to an unrealistic petrol price peg.\n\nThe Central bank is increasingly playing the role of financial intermediary in the place of commercial banks.\n\nThe government is also crowding out the private sector with its sheer size of borrowings. The government could raise close to N3 trillion this year from the domestic capital market alone, three times the N1 trillion that corporates are forecast to raise.\n\nTalks of a national airline are also never off the table in Nigeria.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently set up a committee on poverty composed of government officials.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t lift people out of poverty by setting committees,\u201d said Taiwo Oyedele, an economist and a partner at PWC Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need an enabling environment for businesses to thrive,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\n\u201c50 percent of MSMEs in sub-Saharan Africa are in Nigeria even though we account for 20 percent of the population, this tells us that we need to provide an enabling environment and millions can be lifted out of poverty because if each of the MSMEs in Nigeria can employ one extra person we can create jobs and lift millions out of poverty,\u201d Oyedele added.\n\n\u201cMany small businesses just need the government to get out of the way,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nThe private sector creates the bulk of jobs in Nigeria but data from the World Bank which shows that the ease of doing business in Nigeria ranks among the lowest globally (despite recent gains) means the private sector is constrained.\n\nNigeria improved its ranking on the latest World Bank ease of doing business ranking by moving 15 spots to 131 in 2020, but the country still has anti-business policies according to analysts.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the government focus on improving the ease of doing business to reduce poverty,\u201d a bank CEO told Business Day.\n\n\u201cIf doing business was easy in Nigeria, we can lend more affordably and more businesses can expand and employ more people, but that\u2019s not the case today with the many risks in the economy,\u201d the bank CEO, who did not want to be named said.",

Charles Akhigbe, at the stakeholders\u2019 sensitization meeting at the Government House, Benin City, said the port would improve economic activities in the state and create thousands of jobs for Edo people, as well as Nigerians.\n\nStakeholders at the meeting include Okomu Plc, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Rongtai Industry, ESIPO and Zanithcarex Int\u2019l Limited, among others.\n\nAccording to Akhigbe, \u201cThis is a sensitization meeting to bring all the potential port users in Edo State together under one room, to sensitize them about the AMES-Edo Inland Dry Port and the commencement of operations at the dry port because they are the ones to use the dry port and need to know the stage the dry port is and at what stage to come in and commence operation with us.\n\n\u201cIt will be a customs port, and a lot of activities at the Lagos Port will be done here at Edo State, yielding huge resources for the state and the federal government. This is the first phase and other phases will follow for bigger companies, medium-sized companies and small-scale businesses that are all over the state, to start thinking export.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cWe need to galvanise our people here in the state to take advantage of putting quality edible products together, as we are blessed with agricultural products in Edo, as the port will enable the exportation of quality, safe food products to Africa and the rest of the world directly from Edo State.\n\n\u201cA lot of Edo businessmen are going through hard times through the Lagos Port. But with the Dry Port, no need to go through the Lagos Port but the Edo Dry Port. We need to make sure that the potential port users are aware of the development.\u201d\n\nAkhigbe said AMES-Edo Dry Port was established to provide a one-stop cargo reception and clearance facility to boost exports from and imports into Edo State particularly, Nigeria\u2019s South-South, South-East and some states in the middle belt region, by by providing proper handling and logistics services.\n\n\u201cArrangements are ongoing with the relevant authority for a dedicated cargo airplane that will be able to carry a maximum of 60 tonnes using both the Edo and Delta State Airports.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Government is facilitating the Ossiomo-Power to be connected to the Dry Port for 24/7 electricity supply to reduce cost and ensure that end-users and other stakeholders benefit.\u201d\n\n...",

He told the judge he had learnt his lesson.\n\n\u201cWhen next I am given a responsibility, I will be extra careful. All that glitters is not gold. Everyone is a persona. The way they look is not the way they are. I will be very careful in dealing with people,\u201d he had said before the court.\n\nConflict of interest?\n\nMr Ogban\u2019s lawyer, Mr Agabi, was a lawyer in 2019 to Chris Ekpenyong, the man who defeated Mr Akpabio in the election.\n\nBesides defending Mr Ekpenyong\u2019s victory at that time, Mr Agabi had attacked Mr Akpabio\u2019s petition at the tribunal as being founded on \u201cillegal and unlawful allocation of votes,\u201d apparently referring to Mr Ogban\u2019s fraudulent allocation of fake votes to Mr Akpabio.\n\nTwo senior lawyers in Uyo who are familiar with the case told PREMIUM TIMES it was \u201cunethical\u201d for Mr Agabi to defend the jailed professor.\n\n\u201cHe is setting a bad precedent for younger lawyers,\u201d one of the lawyers said.\n\nMr Agabi did not respond to calls and a text message seeking his comment for the report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "American sprinter Sha\u2019Carri Richardson has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for cannabis, the United States Anti-Doping Agency said on Friday.\n\nThe sanction ruled her out of the 100 metres in Tokyo although she may yet be able to run in later relay events.\n\nThe positive test came at the U.S. Olympic trials last month where Richardson established herself as a gold medal contender by winning the 100m in 10.86 seconds.\n\nThe women\u2019s 100m event in Tokyo starts on July 30, two days after Richardson\u2019s minimum ban ends.\n\nBut the adverse finding means her Olympic qualifying results at the trials, which offer places only to the first three qualified athletes in each event, are annulled.\n\n\u201cThe rules are clear, but this is heartbreaking on many levels,\u201d USADA CEO Travis Tygart said.\n\n\u201cHopefully, her acceptance of responsibility and apology will be an important example to us all that we can successfully overcome our regrettable decisions, despite the costly consequences of this one to her.\u201d\n\nRichardson said in an NBC Interview on the Today Show on Friday that her action came during the trials while she was dealing with the news of the death of her mother.\n\n\u201cLike I tweeted yesterday, I\u2019m human. We are human, I want to be as transparent as possible with you guys whether it\u2019s good, whether it\u2019s bad,\u201d the American sprinter said.\n\n\u201cBut when it comes to Sha\u2019Carri Richardson there will never be a steroid attached to the name Sha\u2019Carri Richardson. The charge and what the situation was marijuana.\u201d\n\nUSADA said Richardson accepted a one-month period of ineligibility that began on June 28, the date of her provisional suspension.\n\nUSADA added her period of ineligibility was reduced to one month because she had used cannabis out of competition and it was unrelated to sport performance.\n\nShe also successfully completed a counselling program regarding her use of cannabis.\n\nThe ban could leave Richardson, the fastest American woman this year with a time of 10.72 seconds, clear to race in the 4x100m relay at the Olympics in the first week of August, if she is selected by USATF.\n\n\u201cSha\u2019Carri Richardson\u2019s situation is incredibly unfortunate and devastating for everyone involved,\u201d USATF said.\n\n\u201cAthlete health and well-being continue to be one of USATF\u2019s most critical priorities and we will work with Sha\u2019Carri to ensure she has ample resources to overcome any mental health challenges now and in the future.\u201d\n\nQuizzed as to whether she was hoping to get a chance to compete in the relay in Tokyo, Richardson said: \u201cRight now I\u2019m just putting all of my time and energy into dealing with what I need to deal with to heal myself.\n\n\u201cSo if I\u2019m allowed to take that place (at the Olympics) I would be grateful for it but if not, right now I\u2019m going to focus on myself.\n\n\u201cThis is just one (Olympic) Games, I\u2019m 21, I\u2019m very young. Unlike most, I have plenty of Games left in me to compete in and I have plenty of talent that backs me up because everything I do comes from me naturally, no steroid, no anything.\n\n\u201cThis incident was about marijuana, so after my sanction is up I\u2019ll be back and able to compete and every single time I step on the track I\u2019ll be ready for whatever anti-doping agency to come and get what it is that they need.\u201d\n\nCannabis is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) but if athletes can prove that their ingestion of the substance was unrelated to sports performance, then a suspension of three months rather than the usual four years is imposed.\n\nIf an athlete is willing to undertake an approved treatment programme in collaboration with their national anti-doping body, then the ban can be reduced to one month.",

          "text": "\u2026FG has released N10bn to support production \u2013 Ehanire \u2026It\u2018ll address inequality in global distribution \u2013 Expert \u2018\u2026Big step in right direction\u2019 \u2026Manufacturers must ensure quality, safety \u2013 Varsity teacher \u2026We\u2019re already upgrading our labs to international standards \u2013 NAFDAC\n\nThe global shortfall in the number of doses of Covid-19 vaccines has created a gap between the higher-income and lower-income countries in terms of access to the highly sought-after commodity. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the move by the African Development Bank (AfDB) to support local production of Covid-19 vaccines in Nigeria and other African countries.\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) Group has disclosed that it would invest \u201cheavily\u201d in the domestic manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines in the African health care system. The AfDB president, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, made the disclosure at the closing of the 2021 Annual Meetings of the bank, on Friday, according to a statement by the bank on Saturday, last week.\n\nAdesina noted that only 51 per cent of public health facilities had basic water and sanitation, while 31 per cent of health care facilities had electricity. The AfDB boss also underlined the fact that Africa still imported 60 to 70 per cent of its pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\u201cThe lives of 1.2 billion people in Africa are at risk. We must give hope to the poor and the vulnerable by ensuring that every African, regardless of their income level, gets access to quality health care, as well as health insurance and social protection,\u201d he had said.\n\nAkinwunmi further proposed an African stability mechanism to act as a firewall against external shocks and pledged the bank\u2019s commitment to strengthen support to African countries. The proposal included that the bank acts as a conduit for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) special drawing rights, which it would then on-lend to African countries.\n\nHe said the support would be towards tackling the economic and health impacts of the pandemic.\n\nFG toes same path\n\nLikewise, President Muhammadu Buhari recently promised that Nigeria would continue to partner with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other countries to ensure accelerated development and manufacturing as well as unhindered supply of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines to all Africans.\n\nPresident Buhari made the promise recently in his remarks while participating in the virtual 34th ordinary session of the African Union from the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nCommitment\n\nAs part of efforts to accelerate local production of the vaccine, the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said the Ministry of Finance had released N10 billion to support the production in the country. He stated this at the Presidential Task Force (PTF) Covid-19 briefing recently in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Finance has released N10 billion to support domestic vaccine production. While we are working to develop our own vaccines, Nigeria is exploring options for licensed production, in collaboration with recognised institutions. We are also exploring the option of local production of the vaccines in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nNAFDAC\u2019s disclosures\n\nAlso, the director-general of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, said the country would start manufacturing vaccines soon while adhering to required global standards.\n\nShe said, \u201cWith regards to the establishment of the World Health Organization\u2019s global benchmarking and adoption of international best practices, we want to get to maturity level three so that Nigeria can manufacture its vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe are upgrading the agency\u2019s laboratories to international standards using equipment that are compliant to ISO 17025. NAFDAC laboratories are changing very rapidly with improvements in new equipment and supplies.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NAFDAC boss, Nigeria aims to manufacture 70 per cent of the pharmaceuticals locally to cut down her dependence on imports.\n\nGood news\n\nSpeaking with this reporter, a medical doctor at the Federal Medical Centre Keffi, Dr. Isa Jatau, said local manufacturing will address the inequality in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines being experienced by developing countries like Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have experienced great frustration regarding the global vaccine supply. Not only have there been huge challenges with respect to vaccine manufacturers producing enough vaccines for the world, but there has been great inequality in terms of distribution.\n\n\u201cMost countries of the world have received a few, and in some cases, no vaccines. This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently and local manufacturing of vaccines in Nigeria and other Africa countries is the most reliable way of addressing the shortfall in vaccine accessibility by poor and vulnerable countries.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s vaccine production history\n\nIn his view, molecular biologists in the department of microbiology at Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Dr. Ishaku Masang, said while Nigeria has over the years produced vaccines for the livestock industry for the local market and for exports to West Africa countries, human vaccine production is non-existent.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a mixture of what I will call the good and the bad. I will start with the good. What Nigeria has up and running is an animal vaccine production laboratory. The National Veterinary Research Institute in Vom, Plateau state, produces vaccines for the livestock industry. It makes a number of vaccines for the local market and for export to other countries in the West African sub-region. It produces viral and bacterial vaccines against several diseases of livestock including cattle, sheep, goats, and chickens.\n\n\u201cThe bad side to the story is that, to my knowledge, human vaccine production is non-existent in Nigeria at the moment. The last time any human vaccine was produced at the Federal Vaccine Production Laboratory was in 1991.\n\n\u201cThere have been recent attempts to resuscitate that facility. The immediate past Minister of Health made some efforts three years ago to revive it. Unfortunately, that effort did not yield the desired results. Nigeria has virologists, molecular biologists and experts in genomics of infectious diseases who are making attempts at local vaccine production, but these are individual efforts using grant funding which cannot sustain such an enterprise.\u201d\n\nAn expert\u2019s take\n\nIn a chat with Blueprint Weekend, a professor of virology, Daniel Oladimeji Oluwayelu, described the move for local manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines as \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nHe however, said for it to happen, Nigeria must invest in health infrastructure and human development.\n\n\u201cI think the move to initiate local vaccine production is a step in the right direction, but the investment has to be sufficient because the sector has been neglected for many years. The reason is that Nigeria does not have a functional vaccine production facility in place. The only laboratory for human vaccine production is at Yaba, Lagos, but it has not been functional for many years now. It will need a lot of money to revamp it and increase its production capacity.\n\n\u201cIt will also need to be staffed with people who have the requisite expertise and experience in modern technologies for production of safer and more efficacious vaccines such as recombinant DNA technology. So, in addition to the African Development Bank (AfDB) and federal government N10 billion funds, there is a lot more that the government would have to do to get local vaccine production going,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, a pharmacist at Federal Medical Centre Jabi, Abuja, told our reporter that the AfDB initiative would boost local pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn the face of this global shortfall, calls to scale up vaccine production capacity in Africa are growing louder. While not a panacea for filling the Covid-19 vaccine production gap in the immediate term, bolstering capacity in Africa to conduct key aspects of the manufacturing process, namely, formulation, filling, and packaging for Covid-19 vaccines will help facilitate access.\n\n\u201cDeveloping the fledgling industry will also help countries prepare for greater self-sufficiency in meeting their growing vaccine needs and prevent future vaccine access crises when the next pandemic hits,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that, \u201cIn recent years, a concerted effort to build up local pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in Africa has begun to pay dividends, paving the way for the nascent vaccine industry. Manufacturers in Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, and elsewhere are becoming major producers of priority medicines for their countries and regions.\n\n\u201cA concerted decades-long effort by the United States Agency for International Development and others to bolster the quality assurance systems of pharmaceutical manufacturers in LMICs toward achieving international quality standards has made many products more competitive.\n\n\u201cAlthough 70%-90% of pharmaceuticals used in Africa are still imported, local manufacturing sectors are poised with latent capacity, and bolstering local production is being urgently prioritised in the face of Covid-19 related shortages.\u201d\n\nQuality\n\nHowever, Prof. Oluwayelu said for Nigeria to succeed in the laudable initiative, the government, manufacturers of vaccines and stakeholders must ensure that Nigeria produces a vaccine that can compete favourably in the world in order to earn the trust of consumers.\n\n\u201cAccess to poor-quality vaccines is worse than no access. The goal of local manufacturing must be to ensure quality, protect patients, and foster trust in vaccine safety.\n\n\u201cTherefore, quality assurance is an essential ingredient to make vaccine production sustainable. Very few national regulatory authorities in Africa have achieved the level of maturity required to enable the production of quality-assured vaccines in their countries. However, there are measures regulators can take to expedite access to Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, efforts to pool expertise and streamline regulatory oversight of vaccines on the continent are moving forward through the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum. For their part, local vaccine manufacturers should work with partners like Africa Centre for Disease Control, the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network, the African Vaccine Manufacturing Initiative, and the Federation of African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations to strengthen their quality management systems toward attaining international standards.\u201d\n\nCollaborations\n\nHe also called for partnership and collaboration among vaccine manufacturers, urging them to share experience and avoid rivalry if they must succeed.\n\n\u201cBeyond the complexity of the vaccine manufacturing process itself, the prerequisite supplies, equipment, facilities, and highly specialized scientific expertise needed to make quality-assured vaccines is beyond the purview of any one company. For example, sourcing inactive ingredients, vials, and stoppers can be limiting factors.\n\n\u201cSimultaneously, like any other business, vaccine manufacturers in Africa must be able to make a return on investment while competing with established manufacturers in countries like India, China, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Important factors include sufficient demand in the country or region, government investment policies and incentives, cost of labor and capital, availability of raw materials, and physical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cEach of these individual barriers can be overcome, but taken as a whole, expanding vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa requires cohesive national and regional strategies that align with national pharmaceutical and industrial policies while addressing areas of weakness and laying out incentives to attract investment.\n\n\u201cFor instance, a regional strategy for manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients could help support this nascent industry while avoiding fragmentation and redundancies. In addition, international procurement agencies could support sustainable access to vaccines and other health products in Africa by carving out a portion of global procurements for African manufacturers producing quality-assured health co-investing now in strengthening vaccine production capacity on the continent will set countries up for success as they prepare to graduate from receiving foreign assistance.\u201d\n\nAdequate funding required\n\nAlso, Dr. Jatau called for increased funding to support local production of vaccines through annual budgetary allocations.\n\n\u201cI think sustainable funding remains the main public policy intervention for revamping Nigeria\u2019s vaccine production capacity. There should be annual budgetary allocations to that sector; the government must see this as a priority.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to pay lip service to it, otherwise we will be caught napping, as we are experiencing with this Covid-19 outbreak. Apart from funding, I think the government should also work with universities by harnessing the knowledge and expertise of researchers working in relevant fields.\u201d",
          "summary": "BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the move by the African Development Bank (AfDB) to support local production of Covid-19 vaccines in Nigeria and other African countries.\nWhile we are working to develop our own vaccines, Nigeria is exploring options for licensed production, in collaboration with recognised institutions.\nWe are also exploring the option of local production of the vaccines in the country,\u201d he said.\nThe last time any human vaccine was produced at the Federal Vaccine Production Laboratory was in 1991.\nThe only laboratory for human vaccine production is at Yaba, Lagos, but it has not been functional for many years now.",

          "text": "The Nigerian government Thursday assured Nigerians and the international community that the rearrested leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, will be given fair trial.\n\nIt also alleged the IPOB leader orchestrated the killing of 60 persons and the destruction of property in 55 violent attacks across the South-east and South-south zones within four months.\n\nKanu is currently facing an 11-count charge bordering on treason, treasonable felony, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms among others.\n\nHe was rearrested Sunday following a collaborative effort between Nigeria\u2019s security agents and the Interpol.\n\nThe IPOB leader was arraigned Tuesday before a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja some four years after jumping bail, and consequently ordered detained at a Department of State Services (DSS) facility in Abuja. His trial continues July 26.\n\nAmong several others, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and the Ohanaeze Ndigbo-the socio-cultural organisations of both the North and South-east respectively, called for fair trial.\n\nAssurance on fair trial\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed assured the IPOB leader would be given fair trial while the case lasts.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is interesting that many are suddenly calling for a fair trial for Kanu as if he didn\u2019t get one before he decided to jump bail and flee. However, I can assure you that the fair deal that Kanu denied many of the victims of the violence which he wilfully instigated through his broadcasts and tweets will not be denied him.\u201d\n\nDescribing the arrest of the proscribed IPOB leader as one of the most classic operations of its type in the world, Mohammed commended \u201cthe professionalism, diligence, patriotism and painstaking efforts of our security and intelligence agencies. We also thank the sister international agencies that collaborated with us to pull off this arrest.\n\n\u201cIt will interest Nigerians to know that for over two years, our security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of the proscribed IPOB leader as he lived a five-star life across several countries, travelling on chartered private jets, living in luxury apartments and turning out in designing clothes and shoes. Of course, as we all saw, he was wearing an attire made by Fendi, a luxury Italian fashion brand, when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cWe can tell you that the forensic investigation carried out so far has revealed a treasure trove of information on the proscribed IPOB leader and his collaborators. While the investigation continues, we assure you that none of the collaborators, irrespective of their standing in the society, will be spared. They will all face the full wrath of the law for their activities that challenge our nation\u2019s sovereignty and threaten its unity. No one, no matter how highly placed, is bigger than the country.\u201d\n\nOn how and where he was arrested, the minister who did not entertain any question from reporters after the brief press conference, admitted there were \u201cspeculations on how this re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed.\n\n\u201cWhat we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations. We continue to respect and honour the obligations.\u201d\n\n\u2018He orchestrated killings\u2019\n\nAlso, the federal government alleged Kanu orchestrated the killing of 60 persons and the destruction of property in 55 violent attacks across the South-east and South-south zones within four months.\n\nThis was contained in a letter sent to western diplomats as reported by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nThe letter dated April 26, 2021 detailed the atrocities committed by members of IPOB on the alleged instruction of Kanu who was then in exile.\n\nNAN also reports that one of the attachments to the letter listed the attacks on lives and property by IPOB in some parts of the country between January and April 2021.\n\nWith several Kanu\u2019s broadcasts from Europe, there were concerns in official quarters that some western countries were justifying IPOB\u2019s violent acts under the guise of the group\u2019s pursuit of self-determination.\n\nAccording to the \u201cdemarche\u201d from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to some western countries, the federal government objected to a statement by an agency of a western nation whose government had noted and admitted that the creation of Eastern Security Network (ESN), based on its own understanding, was to combat insecurity.\n\nThe federal government, in its letter, however considered the statement (by the western nation) as \u201cjustifying the establishment of a militia by a non-state actor and glossing over the destructive and violent acts of IPOB and the ESN.\n\nIt told the western nation that its position may seem to have further emboldened Kanu, adding that this may explain the increased tempo of attacks carried out by members of his group.\n\n\u201cIn under four months this year, IPOB has carried out over fifty-five (55) violent acts in various parts of Southeast Nigeria killing scores of people and destroying many properties.\n\n\u201cIndeed it would seem that the position of the (western nation) seems to have further emboldened Nnamdi Kanu the self-confessed leader of IPOB.\n\n\u201cAs recently as 22nd April, 2021, broadcasting online from his base in London, Mr Kanu has issued series of instructions to his militia and other members of the outlawed organisation, on acts of violence to be carried out within the territory of Nigeria.\u201d .\n\nThe letter made copious references to some of the threats issued by Kanu thus: \u201cOur madness has just begun.\n\n\u201d Every night, young men will not sleep, you will come out, at the starting of every road that leads to every populated area under human habitation to make sure that appropriate road blocks are put in place to slow them down so we can catch them (Fulanis) and kill them.\n\n\u201cThat is what we want you to do. Obiano (Governor of Anambra State) from today onwards, anywhere you are seen in public you will be attacked \u2026. Obiano \u2026 you are a dead man walking.\n\n\u201cAny landlord that gives accommodation or rents his house or her house to a Fulani person, to army personnel, to somebody who works for the police or DSS \u2026.\n\n\u201cKill them. If you see the army and the police in your place, kill all of them\u2026 Kill them.\n\n\u201cFrom today I am announcing, there will be no election in Anambra State. Every edifice of election in Anambra State will be destroyed. I am warning you in advance. There will be no election. There will be no campaign in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cAny vehicle you see, from tonight (22nd April, 2021), 12 midnight to 5, destroy it completely. That is the time they (referring to Fulanis) move about abducting people. And we keep quiet. \u2026 What stops you young people from, once you see them coming around 4am in the morning, you will block all every exits, set it on fire?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will exhaust all the ammunition that they have, then we capture them alive and cut off their heads. All of them. Decapitate them,\u201d the letter further quoted Kanu\u2019s alleged instructions to IPOB members.\n\nIt also noted that members of the outlawed organisation, in furtherance to these instructions, intensified their attacks on the specified targets.\n\nThe federal government also alleged Kanu issues instructions from western capitals using Radio Biafra and members of the outlawed organisation to carry them out in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor example, a day after Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has confirmed to newsmen that Nnamdi Kanu has ordered members of the group to kill him and other South-east Governors, which orders were repeated on Radio Biafra, the private residence of Imo state Governor, Hope Uzodimma, in his hometown in Omuma, Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, was attacked and set ablaze and two of the security men attached to the house were killed,\u201d the federal government said.\n\nBelow is a list of IPOB attacks in the South East/South South Zones as contained in the letter:\n\n1. Abia: Between January 26 and April 19, 2021, six policemen were killed while property worth huge sums were destroyed by IPOB members in coordinated attacks at Uratta junction, Aba North LGA; Omoba Police Station, Isiala-Ngwa South LGA; Abriba Community in Ohafia LGA, and Uzuakoli Police Station in Bende LGA.\n\n2. Akwa Ibom: 25 persons, including security personnel were killed in deliberate attacks on different locations across the state, between January 27 and April 19, 2021.\n\n3. Cross River: Seven police officers were killed at Calabar-Ikom highway in Obubra and Yakur LGAs, on March 2, 2021, while a soldier was killed two days later on March 4 at a military checkpoint at Obubra Junction in Obubra LGA.\n\n4. Delta: Between January 10 And April 14, IPOB members attacked and killed 11 persons including security personnel in Ughelli, Ndokwa East, Ezza South, Onicha, Ezza North, Ohaozara, Ohoukwu, LGAs.\n\n5. Enugu: Three policemen were killed in attacks on different locations across the state between February 28 and April 18.\n\n6. Imo: Between January 3 and April 24, 2021, IPOB members killed seven persons and injured many others in different attacks in Orlu, Obouo, Aboli Mbaise, Chitte Uboma, Isiala Mbano, Owerri, Njaba, Mbatoli, Oru East LGAs.\n\n7. Rivers: On April 17, 2021, IPOB operatives killed an NSCDC operative on guard duty at Shell crude oil manifold in Elelewon village in Obio/Akpor LGA and injured many others.",

Six were armed with AK-47 guns and three others with pump-action rifles,\u201d the DSS spokesman said.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two of the armed men were gunned down, while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative, who was shot by the assailants in his right hand, sustained injury. He has, however, received medical attention and is very stable.\n\n\u201cThe gun duel, which lasted an hour, offered Igboho the chance to escape. Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, is now on the run.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that two of Igboho\u2019s men were killed, the secret service said DSS operative sustained injuries.\n\nIgboho was also said to have escaped during the gun battle and is currently on the run, with security operatives calling on him to turn himself in or be tracked down.\n\nThe 13 suspected armed agitators that were arrested consist of 12 males and 1 female.

          "text": "Belgium and Italy will go head-to-head for a spot in the Euro 2020 semi-finals when they meet in Munich for their quarter-final tie on Friday.\n\nHowever, Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne are still doubtful. Both players were injured in the last-16 clash against Portugal \u2013 De Bruyne suffered an ankle injury, while Hazard pulled a hamstring \u2013 and they have not trained this week, including on Thursday morning before the team flew to Germany.\n\n\u201cIt will be difficult for Eden to play tomorrow because of a soft issue injury and maybe a little different for Kevin who\u2019s had a ligament problem,\u201d Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said.\n\n\u201cWe know that we are fighting against time but we are going to take until the last minute to take the decision. We have seen an improvement but we\u2019ll only see tomorrow whether they can be involved or not. Unfortunately, we cannot make a decision at the moment.\u201d\n\nAfter maintaining their winning record at Euro 2020 with a 1-0 victory over Portugal, Martinez also said it was a pity the two teams were meeting at this stage of the tournament.\n\n\u201cWe are the best two teams statistically at the tournament. Two teams that have each won a record 14 games in a row in the European Championship,\u201d Martinez added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame we have to face each other in the quarter-final. But it\u2019s the quality of this tournament I suppose and we need to be ready for it. There are not a lot of secrets, both sides look like club teams and tomorrow\u2019s game is going to be decided by small details.\u201d\n\nItaly, who conceded their first goal in 19 hours and 28 minutes against Austria in their 2-1 last-16 victory on Saturday, have also impressed in attack, scoring nine goals in four matches in the tournament.\n\nBut the prospect of facing Belgium, who have also won four out of four games at Euro 2020, does not mean Mancini will adopt more conservative tactics.\n\n\u201cWe will play our own game, well aware that we are up against the best team in the world at this moment of time,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cIf they have been top of the FIFA rankings for three years, it means they have been very good for a long time, but we will still play our way.\n\n\u201cWe could tweak a few things along the way if things do not go to plan, but we have a certain style of play and Belgium do too. I am sure it will be a wonderful game of football. The winner will be the team who makes the fewest errors.\u201d\n\nBelgium\u2019s main attacking threat is a familiar one for the Azzurri defence with Romelu Lukaku, who has scored three goals at Euro 2020, set to spearhead Martinez side\u2019s attack at the Allianz Arena.\n\nLukaku was voted Player of the Year in Serie A last season, as he fired Inter Milan to their first top-flight title in 11 years.\n\n\u201cWe have got a lot of respect for Lukaku because he had a great season for Inter, and this goes for our entire squad,\u201d said defender Giorgio Chiellini. \u201cAll season we witnessed what a match-winner and important player he has become.\n\n\u201cI think it would be doing a disservice to say Belgium are all about Romelu Lukaku, though, as they have quality players throughout the pitch. We will prepare as we always have done, keeping an eye on Lukaku and their other top players.\u201d\n\nWith De Bruyne and Hazard\u2019s involvement yet to be confirmed, Belgium are set to have the remainder of their squad available for the quarter-final.\n\nItaly have no new injury concerns, with Chiellini set to return after missing the last-16 fixture against Austria with a thigh injury.\n\nThis will be the fifth meeting between Belgium and Italy at a major tournament \u2013 all four previous meetings came in the group stages, in the 1954 World Cup and European Championship in 1980, 2000 and 2016. Italy avoided defeat in all four matches, winning three and drawing one.\n\nAgainst no side have Belgium played more games at major tournaments without winning than Italy (4, level with France and Germany) while the only European nations Italy have faced more often at the same tournaments without losing are Germany (9) and Austria (5).\n\nItaly have reached the quarter-final of the European Championship for a fourth consecutive tournament. Each of those previous three appearances at this stage have been decided by a penalty shootout, with the Italians eliminated by Spain in 2008 and Germany in 2016 while progressing past England in 2012. Indeed, that accounts for three of Italy\u2019s five European Championship penalty shootouts \u2013 more than any other nation prior to the 2020 edition.\n\nBelgium have won seven of their last eight matches at the European Championships \u2013 the exception in this run was at this stage at Euro 2016, when they lost 3-1 to Wales.\n\nItaly have won all four of their matches at EURO 2020; they have never won five consecutive games at the European Championship finals, while only twice previously have they won five or more in a row at any major tournament (World Cup/Euros), winning seven in a row at the World Cup from 1934 to 1938 and five in succession at the World Cup in 1990.",

          "text": "Australia will halve the number of international arrivals it accepts after Covid outbreaks put half the population in lockdown this week.\n\nThe country\u2019s strict border rules have only allowed Australians and people with exemptions to enter.\n\nFrom 14 July, Australia will accept just over 3,000 people a week \u2013 a measure likely to last until next year.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the cuts would reduce pressure on the quarantine system.\n\nVirus leaks from hotel quarantine \u2013 which is mandatory for all arrivals \u2013 have been the source of numerous outbreaks across the country.\n\n\u201cSimply reducing the caps doesn\u2019t necessarily provide a fail safe but because of the particular virulency of the Delta strain, it is believed that is a prudent action while we remain in this suppression phase of the virus,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\nThe Australian government has faced criticism for its strict border policies and the new arrival caps will make it even more difficult for many to return home.\n\nTo mitigate some of the cuts, Mr Morrison said the number of repatriation flights for Australians wanting to fly home would be increased. It would also begin trialling home quarantine arrangements for vaccinated travellers.\n\nMr Morrison indicated that arrival limits would not be lifted again until most Australians have been vaccinated \u2013 a goal that won\u2019t be achieved until next year.\n\nThe new rules come after outbreaks of the highly infectious Delta variant plunged seven cities \u2013 including Sydney, Brisbane and Perth \u2013 into lockdowns over the past week.\n\nThe country has recorded about 250 cases, with most tied to a cluster in Sydney, its largest city. Sydney\u2019s five million residents are under a stay-at-home order until 9 July.\n\nThe outbreak there stemmed from an unvaccinated driver who transported international arrivals, and the virus then spread in the community.\n\n\u201cWe have seen breaches occur, predominantly as a result of infection control procedures and human error\u2026 those issues need to continue to be strengthened,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\nThe outbreaks in five states and territories marked the most widespread transmission of the virus in Australia this year.\n\nIt also highlighted the nation\u2019s slow vaccine rollout, with less than 8% of adults fully vaccinated.\n\nThe Delta outbreaks prompted emergency talks between the prime minister and state and territory governments.\n\nOn Friday, following a meeting of all government leaders, Mr Morrison announced a new timeline for Australians on \u201cthe pathway out of Covid\u201d which included the international arrival cuts.\n\nHe said while the country had focused on the suppression of the virus, it would ultimately move to manage Covid \u201cas an infectious disease like any other in our community\u201d.\n\nHowever, he said Australia remains in the first phase of suppressing Covid spread. A shift to later stages \u2013 including a move away from lockdowns \u2013 would require most Australians to be vaccinated.\n\nAustralia is relying on the AstraZeneca and the Pfizer vaccines to immunise its population.\n\nDelays in the rollout have largely been attributed to widespread hesitancy over the AstraZeneca shot, and a lack of Pfizer supplies.\n\nMr Morrison reiterated on Friday that all Australians would be able to receive their first dose by the end of 2021.",

          "text": "The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Thursday failed to agree on whether or not to keep crude oil output at current levels or open the taps for a further easing of production quotas by roughly two million barrels between now and December.\n\nEarlier, there were expectations that the cartel could boost production output by another 400,000 barrels beginning in August, an increase seen as likely to be easily absorbed by the market amid expectations for rising demand.\n\nIt was gathered that the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMCC) failed to come to a conclusion on the recommendations and will meet again today to iron out the rough edges.\n\nAt the inconclusive meeting, the OPEC+ ministerial committee had proposed the planned increase to the wider group, but a disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia, the biggest producers in the OPEC+ alliance, remained largely unresolved.\n\nLast year, following the death-blow, dealt on the oil market by the COVID-19 pandemic, OPEC+ resolved to cut output by almost 10 million bpd from May 2020, with plans to phase out the curbs by the end of April 2022.\n\nBefore the deferment of the meeting, oil prices reacted with Brent crude trading above $75 a barrel, close to a two-and-a-half-year high as the policy from August to December was being awaited.\n\nWhile the full house decided to shift a definitive decision on the matter till today, OPEC had earlier finished its meeting just before an OPEC+ ministerial committee met after that, before the inconclusive one by OPEC+ ministers.\n\nThe Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of OPEC had a day earlier stated that it expected oil demand to grow by six million bpd in 2021 but flagged risks of a glut in 2022, saying there were \u201csignificant uncertainties\u201d including an uneven global recovery and rising cases of the Delta variant of Coronavirus.\n\nSources close to the meeting said the idea of a gradual increase featured in both policy drafts put forward for the vote at the ministerial meeting, while one of the proposals suggested extending the coalition\u2019s output restraint deal until the end of 2022.\n\nRussia hinted that it viewed the current oil price of around $75 per barrel as a sign of overheating, prompting Moscow to support a further increase of production by the group, with Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Alexander Novak, saying that prices in a range of $45-$60/bbl would be optimal.\n\nOne of the factors that could shape the decision today is the status of talks between Iran and the U.S., which are seeking to revive their nuclear pact and potentially lift sanctions on the Islamic Republic\u2019s oil exports.\n\nSpeaking during one of the sessions, the Secretary-General of OPEC, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, had urged members to be watchful of the pace of the global vaccination rollout versus the speed of COVID-19 variants taking hold.\n\nHe, however, stated that OPEC still sees growth in the second half of the year.\n\nOn the supply side, Barkindo reiterated that non-OPEC liquids production in 2021 is forecast to grow by 0.8 mb/d, a drop of 0.1 mb/d from the number presented in November 2020.\n\nHe said OPEC member-countries and all Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) participants had contributed to the rebound and recovery since November last year, with overall conformity levels consistently over 100 per cent.\n\nHe added that the administering of three billion doses of vaccine against COVID-19 worldwide represents an unprecedented achievement in the history of medical science, combined with the effects of around $26 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus in some countries.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami on Thursday insisted that the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria was informed by the need to protect the national interest.\n\nMalami stated that the interest of Nigeria is paramount in all considerations and must be respected by any company that wants to do business in the country.\n\nThe minister spoke at a meeting in Abuja with the High Commissioner of Great Britain, Ms. Catriona Laing.\n\nThe duo discussed bilateral issues relating to asset recovery, anti-corruption crusade, amendment of the Electoral Act, the Audit Bill, Petroleum Industry Bill, Twitter ban and counter-terrorism approaches.\n\nMalami\u2019s spokesman, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, in a statement, quoted the minister as saying: \u201cIf you want to operate as a business entity in Nigeria, you must do so within the context of Nigerian laws. Nothing offensive or that breaches the Nigerian laws should be entertained.\u201d\n\nMalami said the federal government had established a committee on the matter and the company had approached the government over the issue.\n\nOn PIB, the minister said steps had been taken to ensure pending bills were transmitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.\n\nAccording to him, the fundamental interest and objective of the Buhari administration is to leverage on the bills to enhance value in terms of creating enabling environment for investment, protecting the public interest for the maximum benefit all.\n\nMalami said the essence of the amendment of the Electoral Act was to enhance the democratic system by addressing delays in judicial determination of pre-election matters as well as ensuring justice and fairness in the conduct of electoral processes, including party primaries.\n\nHe said to strengthen the fight against corruption, the government came up with the Proceeds of Crime Bill and Audit Bill, among others.\n\nMalami said public interest had been the uppermost consideration in the quest by the federal government for the regulation of freedom of expression, adding that restrictions to freedom of expression are locally and internationally recognised.\n\n\u201cOur government is not averse to freedom.
