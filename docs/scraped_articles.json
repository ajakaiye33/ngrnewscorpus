One of these meetings was held at the Force Headquarters of Operation Whirl Stroke in Makurdi and issues discussed at the meeting centred on how to find lasting solutions to the security challenges.\n\nRegarding banditry on the Abuja-Kaduna road and Kaduna state, Onyeuko said, \u201cTroops of Operation Thunder Strike and Whirl Punch theatres recorded a few incidents of security concern. In the course of the operations within the period, troops intercepted and arrested criminal elements as well as recovered arms and ammunitions.\n\n\u201cNotably, on 3 December 2021, troops arrested a notorious armed bandit at Paka community in Igabi LGA of Kaduna State, who revealed that the Head of vigilantes in Rigasa aids armed banditry and is involved in some attacks and kidnap incidents in the environment.\n\n\u201cOther incidents with significant results were recorded at; Hayin Gada and Rugan Alhaji Ori villages in Igabi LGA of Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike, within the period carried out airstrikes against armed bandits at their enclaves.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\n\nA group, the Kaduna Polytechnic ( KADPOLY) Stakeholders Forum which comprised critical stakeholders in the administration and future of the Kaduna Polytechnic, has said it was not unaware of the huge concern that the alleged undue interference of the Executive Secretary of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) Professor Idris Mohammed Bugaje in the affairs of the institution was rapidly generating.\n\nThis was made known in a statement signed by Malam Musa Muhammad, Chairman and Joseph Kazachan, Secretary of the Forum, issued to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nThe Forum said it has fully noticed that the concern predicated on the fear that the situation, if not properly handled, will degenerate into a full-blown crisis that can rob the institution of the stability it is currently enjoying.\n\n\u201c\u200bIt is, in fact, absolutely unfortunate that Professor Bugaje who, until his appointment as the Executive Secretary of NBTE, was the Rector of the Kaduna Polytechnic and to whom tremendous support was extended by the present Acting Rector Dr Suleiman Umar who was at the time the Director of Academic Planning and later Deputy Rector, as well as other Management staff, is now, in his bid to continue to exercise full control over the institution, trying to cause uncertainty and chaos in the institution.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn his usual manner, Bugaje has now resorted to effort aimed at destabilizing the Kaduna Polytechnic Management and embarrass the Governing Council under Senator Mohammed Mohammed whom we all know is a respected elder.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201dWe have observed that after his attempt to cause disaffection between the community of the institution and the Management on the one hand and on the other hand between the Management and the Governing Council has failed, he has now taken the matter to the public domain by engaging the media instead of waiting for the response of the Federal Ministry of Education to his letter of complaint about the matter as required of every public servant. His allegations of breach of procedure in the reappointment of Dr Sulaiman Umar as Acting Rector for six months and allegation of monetary inducement of the Governing Council are clearly unfair, unsubstantiated and therefore mischievous.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201dBy clearly alleging, in a submission he made to the media, that the Governing Council has violated section 16 of the Polytechnic Act of 2019 (As amended) by re-appointing the Acting Rector, even further stating that the decision was monetarily influenced, the NBTE ES has shown his full colour as a person whose resolve to inflict maximum damage on the governance process in polytechnic is total.\n\nThe allegations are absolutely baseless considering the fact that the section under reference which, as quoted in his submission, provides that \u201cIn case of vacancy in the office of the Rector, the council shall appoint an Acting Rector who shall not be in office for more than six months\u201d clearly refers to a situation in which a substantive Rector is removed on the authority of the President of the country because of gross misconduct as clearly stated in section 2 of the same Act.\n\nThis certainly is not the kind of circumstance that led to the emergence of Dr Suleman Umar as the Acting Rector of Kaduna Polytechnic.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201dMoreover, the other fundamental part of the Act that Professor Bugaje has mischievously ignored is section 5, sub-section one which provides that the \u201cCouncil shall have the power to do anything which, in its opinion, is calculated to facilitate the carrying out of the activities of the Polytechnic and promote its best interest.\u201d This is a section that supports the decision of the Governing Council to make the reappointment which is clearly in the best interests of the institution as evident in the appreciable consolidation of industrial harmony and continuity of activities in the institution.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201dHappily, the most critical segments of the polytechnic\u2019s community which are the various staff unions and the Students Union Government (SUG) have already uncovered the plan of the NBTE ES to cause disruption in the operations of the institution and have therefore justifiably dismissed all those allegations as baseless.\u201d\n\n\u201d The ASUP, in particular, has, in its reaction to the allegations as contained in a letter it sent to the Minister of Education, maintains that \u201csection 7, sub-section one of the Act gives the Council the general powers to do anything which in its opinion is calculated to facilitate the carrying out of the activities of the Polytechnic and promote its best interest and the union strongly believes that it is in that direction the Council so Acted.\u201d\n\n\u200bHaving carefully studied this matter and consequently understood the fact that Bugaje is only totally out to derail the Management of the polytechnic under Dr Umar as Acting Rector, our Forum finds it convenient to connect the emerging scenario being engineered by the NBTE ES with his attitudes in Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa, Nasarawa State, and the National Research Institute for Chemical Technology Zaria where he served as the Rector and the Director-General, respectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Forum and the other members of the public are fully aware of the controversies that characterised his tenure in both institutions which were caused by his high-handedness and absolute disregard for established procedures and which resulted in his unceremonious exit from each.\n\n\u200bIt was even this knowledge that made the largest section of the Kaduna Polytechnic\u2019s community and other critical stakeholders vehemently oppose his appointment as a Rector on the 17th of September 2017. We all recall that, based on some justifiable negative perceptions about him, a lot of groups protested the emergence of Professor Bugaje as the Rector of the polytechnic as contained in a letter of complaint by Concerned Youth Citizens of Nigeria dated 22nd September 2017 and addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari. In the letter, the group wondered how Professor Bugaje who \u201cwas INDICTED and SANCTIONED in a GOVERNMENT WHITE PAPER\u201d on the report of the Visitation Panel to the Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa where he was a Rector could be appointed as a Rector of the Kaduna Polytechnic.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201dIn the White Paper to which the above reference was made and which was dated 5th October 2004 the Federal Ministry of Education confirmed that \u201cmost of the allegations which were levelled against the Rector Dr I.M. Bugaje have been substantiated.\u201d It was further stated that the Visitor to the institution\u201d is also aware of the strained relationship between Dr Bugaje and the immediate community\u2019\u2019 and therefore directed that \u201cthe second tenure of Dr I.M Bugaje should not be renewed.\u201d\n\n\u200bThe findings of the Visitation Panel which provided the basis of the government\u2019s decision were, as stated, in a letter dated 10th April 2005 and signed by the Director in charge of Higher Education at the time, Dr P S Abdu, on behalf of the Minister of Education, and addressed to Bugaje, were \u201cthe provision of cash advance to unconfirmed officers and \u201cglaring cases of violation of financial regulations such that the Accountant General\u2019s Inspection Report directed immediate compliance.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201dAll the above are enough to show Bugaje\u2019s antecedents which are all about misconduct and irregularities. It is therefore not surprising that as Rector of the Kaduna Polytechnic and up till now as the ES of the NBTE he has continued to demonstrate a tendency for the creation and sustenance of a crisis situation which will cripple the institution.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201dOn the basis of all the above facts, the Kaduna Polytechnic Stakeholders Forum wishes to make the following demands.\n\nProfessor Idris Mohammed Bugaje should refrain from undue interference in the affairs of the Kaduna Polytechnic.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Education should warn the NBTE ES against such undue interference which will hinder smooth administration of the Polytechnic.\n\nThe Management of Kaduna Polytechnic should be specifically encouraged to continue to discharge its responsibilities so that the existing stability in the institution can continue to prevail.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, we pray to Almighty God to save our esteemed Kaduna Polytechnic from the mischief of those who are bent on causing chaos in the institution,\u201d the statement added.\n\nEfforts are still being made to reach the NBTE boss for his reaction as of time of filing this report.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026say handiwork of enemies of democracy\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu, ABUJA\n\nCIVIL Society Organisations, CSOs, Thursday, condemned alleged fake news over rejection of Electoral Act Amendment Bill by President Muhammadu Buhari, allegedly published by one of the national dailies.\n\nThe CSOs described the news headline as a hatchet job, shameless and unfortunate to misinform Nigerians and mislead Mr President as contained in a statement signed by Executive Director, Adopt A Goal for Development Initiative, Ariyo-Dare Atoye; The Convener, Raising New Voices Initiative, Jude Feranmi; and Executive Director, Speak Out Africa Initiative, Kenneth Eze.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cFellow Nigerians, we woke up this morning (Thursday) to the FAKE NEWS HEADLINE by The Sun Newspapers which read \u2018Buhari Rejects Electoral Bill\u2019. This hatchet job carried out by some crooked persons to misinform Nigerians and mislead the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is shameless and unfortunate.\n\n\u201cIn an era where FAKE NEWS continues to harm our society, cause chaos and hamper democracy, we are shocked that The Editorial Management of The Sun newspapers and some online news outlets would render their reputation and their platform to be used for this shoddy job.\n\n\u201cWe can authoritatively confirm that Mr President has not forwarded any letter rejecting the Electoral Amendment Bill to the National Assembly. The interview granted by one of the APC governors published as news and stating that Mr President has rejected the bill based on the phantom N500 billion costs of logistics for monitoring the direct primaries of political parties is a barefaced LIE.\n\n\u201cWhile it is known to the people that some politicians are habitual liars to the public, have no integrity whatsoever and do not care about the public trust for the office which they occupy even when they attain such positions crookedly, an issue as dear to the heart of the Nigerian people as the Electoral Amendment Bill will not be allowed to be derailed by these kinds of politicians.\n\n\u201cWe want Nigerians to ask Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State, former Governor Orji Uzor Kalu of Abia State, and Presidential spokesman Femi Adesina what they knew about this plot using the Daily Sun. We hope the President will be mindful of his integrity and who to associate with.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate again that Mr President promised on several occasions when he spoke about the Electoral Bill that he would sign an Electoral Amendment Bill sent to him by the National Assembly and in time for the elections. Mr President also promised that he would accord INEC ALL that they need to ensure the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in the next general elections.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt whatsoever, the Nigerian people stand behind and support in whole this amendment bill sent by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, which Mr President wrote to asking for their opinion about the bill has written back to say that they support the bill and the President should not hesitate in assenting to the bill. Only devious politicians who would not benefit from the electoral and political reforms that this bill would bring to the country are against this bill.\u201d\n\nHowever, the statement asked that \u201cThat Mr President immediately assents to the Electoral Amendment Bill to fill up this national vacuum that the delay in signing the bill is causing. Nigerians in the rural areas who are not privy to national events would continue to be misled by devious politicians and crooked newspaper editors should this vacuum continue to exist.\n\n\u201cThat Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria, the Press Council, Nigerian Guild of Editors and the National Union of Journalists should investigate immediately the online blogs and The Sun newspaper for this barefaced LIE presented to the people as news, not just to mislead the Nigerian public but also misrepresent the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, Mr President and the Nigerian people must note that the Electoral Amendment Bill is the most reform-minded legislation for the most important part of our democratic journey since the 4th Republic began, our elections.\n\n\u201cThus, the people must stand strongly behind it, Mr President must find the courage to do the right thing by signing it into law and refuse to be distracted. The electoral umpire must find the boldness to execute and implement this law when it has been passed.\n\n\u201cIf we do all of this and more, our country will continue on its journey towards prosperity for all when the leaders genuinely chosen by the people and given the people\u2019s mandate emerge.\n\n\u201cLastly, we urge the President to invite representatives of CSOs, Youth groups and Women groups to the Electoral Bill signing ceremony.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

While we repeat that these people have always been on hand to kill prospective projects not minding how their selfish and baseless attitude affect the general good which those projects have the potentials to bring to the entire state, we hope that the government of Akwa Ibom state has paid attention to the continuous insults threats and disdain meted out against Ibeno by the Ekids these past months.\n\n\u201cTo this end, we wish to sound a note of warning that: no part of Ibeno land belongs to Eket. BUA refinery is to be located in Ibeno. Ibeno will not tolerate any trespass to its land.\n\n\u201cIbeno will defend BUA activities, its personnel, both local and expatriates. Ibeno will never take up arms against Eket but we will not fold our hands and watch the activities of miscreants in our land.\n\n\u201cIf one leaf is taken from Ibeno into Eket, we will enter and collect twelve leaves, we will equally not permit one BUA personnel to be hurt or killed by Eket in the course of carrying out their legitimate construction work in Ibeno which will be a blessing to Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe know that there are no developmental strides carried out anywhere in the state that will not have a constructive and positive impact on all members of the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe skittish and erratic behaviour of the people of Eket cannot, therefore, be explained except that they have considered themselves untouchables or they have exclusive rights to foment trouble.\u201d\n\nAkwa Ibom: Ibeno community sues state government over alleged bias in teachers recruitment",

Kabba was in September. Abologo was in October and Jos was in November. Those captured the attacks. As painful as those attacks were, very painful, nobody will really want the end of justice to be so vulnerable.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThe custodial facilities are the final end of criminal justice administration. So, morally, the state owes itself the responsibility of safe custody that must not be violated.\n\n\u201cOn that account alone, we must appreciate the enormity of any successful attack on custodial facilities. And I so do. But I want us to put these things in the context of our security situation.\n\n\u201cWhen our best does not suffice, it\u2019s no longer a question of your inability to make preparation or failure for preparation or preparedness. It\u2019s just that at that instance, you just couldn\u2019t hold the defence. And several factors are responsible for this.\n\n\u201cWhat I can assure Nigerians is this. Yes, as contextual as these attacks and the successes such criminals are having, we are upping our game and we will not allow; we will prevent any such opportunistic attack and even make it impossible. That is what the state must do.\n\n\u201cWe are working with all arms of government, particularly the security, to make our custodial facilities impregnable. We will not rest until that is achieved. So, that\u2019s the assurance I\u2019ll give to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs to whether it calls for my resignation. I still don\u2019t see any need for that because it\u2019s not for lack of preparedness that the attacks were successful. No.\u201d\n\nAlso, the FEC has approved N965.9 million for the purchase of 49 operational vehicles for us by the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS).

          "text": "The outgoing leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dismissed insinuations that the party \u201ctaxed\u201d Governor Godwin Obaseki for the September 2020 governorship ticket.\n\nThe PDP had, at the last minute, offered its ticket to Obaseki to re-contest the election, upon his disqualification from the race by the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the platform of which he won his first election in 2016.\n\nBut, in an apparent reaction to the speed with which Osaseki secured the party\u2019s ticket, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike had branded the PDP leaders \u201ctax collectors\u201d, a veiled accusation of selling the ticket to the highest bidder.\n\nHowever, the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, rejected the \u201ctax collectors\u201d tag as he urged Obaseki to explain to Nigerians and PDP members the processes that led to his emergence as a PDP candidate.\n\nOlogbondiyan spoke yesterday at a valedictory season held in honour of the outgoing team of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nUrging the Edo governor to tell the truth about the allegation of bribery made against the Uche Secondus-led NWC, Ologbondiyan said the party leaders did not collect any gratification from Obaseki before giving him the ticket.\n\nOlogbondiyan said: \u201cLet me state without mincing words; that the governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, owes members of this NWC the responsibility of clearing our names before the public.\n\n\u201cI will like to place on record that this NWC did not demand any form of gratification from Obaseki before he got the ticket of our party. It is also important to restate that this NWC did not demand any form of \u201ctax\u201d from Governor Obaseki nor did we collect the same. He, therefore, owes it a duty to clear our names.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the outgoing NWC did its best to reposition and rebuild the party, leading to the regaining of some states.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2019 elections, we had already added three governors from Sokoto, Kwara, and Benue states. The Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives led a good number of their colleagues to team up with the party. The APC adopted a reckless maximum rigging to snatch Ekiti and Osun.\n\n\u201cWe rebuilt the party in content and character and this made it an attraction. We came out of the election with 17 governors; the APC stole Imo State while three governors later left the party to pursue personal endeavours, which was the fault of the NWC. The 2018 elective national convention, which produced our presidential candidate, was adjudged the best. It was keenly contested and not by consensus. At the end, none of the astakes, Ayu urged them to learn from such mistakes as they relinquished their positions.\n\nThe party chair said: \u201cI believe whatever mistakes you think you have made, it is only human and all the PDP family will not only appreciate you better but also be ready to forgive you for whatever mistakes you have made.\n\n\u201cBecause your contribution is bigger than whatever mistakes you must have made. And I think you should be proud and very willing to participate actively in party activities. The experience you have gained cannot be bought in the market. It is only experienced people who help us to see that we achieved more.\n\n\u201cThe journey ahead is going to be turbulent and rough. Many people have attributed to me all sorts of capabilities. I\u2019m sorry am not Jesus Christ, neither am I Prophet Mohammed. I am only a team leader who believes firmly that to run a big political party of this nature, you must work with everybody.\n\n\u201cWe must work as a team; there will be no divisions. We will not allow any divisions. And that will extend to all other members of the party. We intend to run an inclusive administration. And that will include all members of the current working committee that is about to handover to us.\n\n\u201cIt will extend to broadening the frontiers of administration to include every party leader in every state. And I believe together we will succeed. And if we succeed, I have succeeded. I thank you for the work you have done in organising this particular valedictory session.\n\n\u201cI think this valedictory session should have actually been an expanded NEC (National Executive Committee) meeting and everybody should have been here to listen to the statements you have made. But I think we have learned from you because, in the next couple of years, we too will be organising another valedictory session. I will try to ensure that everybody is on board.\u201d",

          "text": "SIR: President Muhammadu Buhari and his men and women in government have again proved that no amount of money builds a nation. The national dailies every day since he became the president in May 2015 have one item about how Nigeria is trying to borrow billions of dollars or how the National Assembly is approving one jumbo loan for PMB or how the public is expressing fear that Nigeria\u2019s debt is not sustainable or how the finance minister is explaining that Nigeria needs the loans to erect critical infrastructure.\n\nBut the states of the nation and economy say it all \u2013 No amount of money builds a nation.\n\nPMB has been borrowing streams of billions of dollars claiming that he wants to build critical infrastructure with the money. What is critical infrastructure? Where are the roads, bridges, railways, dams, electricity generating and distributing plants Nigeria erected 55 years before 2015? Where are the roads, bridges, railways, etc., today? They do not exist! Why? It is because of the nature of all types of infrastructure. They experience depreciation. They are depreciating assets (DAs). They may be likened to a profusely leaking water tank. No wise individual tries to fill a profusely leaking water-tank with water. That explains why all the industrialized and rich nations of today built relevant infrastructure after they had achieved industrialization and had developed the capabilities to build, repair and restore the value of depreciated infrastructure.\n\nWhy is Nigeria always looking for money to borrow? Do Nigerians think and reason at all? When did the government of Nigeria exit from a debt trap? It was during the Obasanjo administration 1999-2007. Nigeria and other African nations were forced to adopt the punitive African Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). The African SAP and its mandatory currency-devaluing foreign exchange market lack growth-promoting elements; they have only been promoting mass unemployment and poverty and de-industrialising Africa. What does PMB and his government want to prove \u2013 disgrace Nigeria more?\n\nHow long does it take to build a road in Nigeria, judging from the West-East and Ibadan-Lagos roads-building experiences? How long do Nigerian roads last? How many times has Nigeria attempted to resuscitate the colonial railway system? Why should a government that has just eight years borrow huge amounts of money that would be paid over many decades for erecting infrastructure that would last only a few years?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBorrowing is no solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems. Nigeria borrows frivolously because of the frivolous claims associated with capital investment and Nigeria\u2019s development endeavours. The claim that capital investment promotes growth is a frivolous fallacy. It has no historical and scientific bases. It is a very sad claim for Africa. The sad and frivolous claim is responsible for the pitiable state of Nigeria and all other African nations. Nigeria\u2019s borrowings have never been for development.\n\nNo one solves a problem s/he does not understand. I have always insisted that the problem with Nigeria is lack of understanding of what the growth and development of a nation entails. All the rich nations in Europe, the United States of America (USA) and Asia were poor when they were not industrialized and had agricultural/artisan economies like those of all African nations of today. Industrialisation is the solution to mass unemployment, poverty, poor infrastructure, high insecurity, etc. Mere capital investment on infrastructure does not promote sustainable economic growth and industrialisation.\n\nFrancis Ogbimi,\n\n([email protected])",

The protracted resolution of the dispute exacerbated the state of affairs at AEDC resulting in an industrial action and a total blackout in the service area for over 14 hours.\n\n\u2018\u2018It then became apparent that decisive steps were required to address the matter and BPE agreed with the lender\u2019s request to exercise its powers as Receiver/Manager over Kann by exercising its powers over the 60 per cent equity in AEDC as a means to recovering the acquisition loan granted by the bank.\u201d\n\nThe statement further claried that the action to appoint an interim team to manage AEDC was not done on the basis of a directive from the Federal Government as being falsely re- ported in some section of the media but on the basis of legal processes arising from the failure of the core investor in AEDC to meet its obligations to a lender.\n\nIt noted that the Receiver/ Manager has agreed to the appointment of an interim management team in conjunction with BPE as part of measures designed to address business failure events and ensure continuity of service to end-use customers in the service area.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

So, everything should not be left in the hands of the State.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike, in reaction to the request for the provision of secretariat for the Nigerian legion, wondered what the leadership of the legion does with the monetary supports that they receive each year.\n\nAccording to him, it remains surprising that the legionnaires in the State are unable to provide some basic operational facility like a secretariat for themselves.\n\nThe governor said Rivers Government alone, within the last six year of his tenure has donated not less than N150 million to them annually, and if the resources were well managed, would have provided them a secretariat without going hand-in-cap to government.\n\n\u201cIf you check for the six years, I\u2019ve launched this emblem with not less than N20 million in every year. And check each January 15th, I have given you not less than N150 million.

          "text": "Femi Falana, human rights lawyer, will meet with the Lagos chief coroner following his call for an inquest into the death of Sylvester Oromoni, the deceased student of Dowen College, Lagos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowen College, situated in Lekki, has been in the eye of the storm since the demise of the 12-year-old schoolboy.\n\nOromoni\u2019s father had alleged that his child was beaten and force-fed a liquid substance that killed him.\n\nBut the school denied the claim, alleging that he sustained injuries while playing football with his mates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOromoni\u2019s death sparked courage online, resulting in the sealing off of the school by the state government.\n\nHakeem Odumosu, Lagos police commissioner, had ordered an investigation into the incident.\n\nThe meeting between Falana, counsel to the Oromonis, and the chief coroner will take place at the combined high court and magistrate court of Lagos, Epe on December 15.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCLASH OF JURISDICTIONS FOR CORONER\u2019S INQUEST?\n\nGiven that the late boy, who attended school in Lagos until his death, passed away in Delta state where he was receiving treatment, a clash of jurisdictions as to where the coroner\u2019s inquest will take place may arise.\n\nTemitayo Adeniyi, a lawyer who spoke to TheCable, said the priority in such situations where two states are involved in a death case will be to identify where the events leading to the deceased\u2019s death took place \u2014 in this case, Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit a dicey situation since the event leading to his death took place in Lagos within the school. And he was a student of Dowen College Lagos until his death. Ordinarily, each state has its own coroner system,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo avoid conflict of jurisdiction, if an incident happens in Lagos; Lagos has its own chief judge that will appoint the coroner to investigate the cause of death. The same thing applies across the board in all the states.\n\n\u201cIn this case, despite the fact that the place of death is in Delta, the ideal place to do the inquest is Lagos state, where the alleged incident leading to his death actually took place.\n\n\u201cIn the course of finding out what transpired, there is no way reference will not be made to Lagos, even if the inquiry is conducted in Delta where the boy actually died.\u201d\n\n\u2018ARRESTED STUDENTS WILL BE CHARGED TO COURT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother lawyer in the know of the Oromoni case spoke anonymously to TheCable. He said Lagos was chosen to conduct the coroner\u2019s inquest because the cause of Oromoni\u2019s death has been traced to Dowen College.\n\nHe said the procedure towards the inquiry has already been initiated ahead of December 15 when the preliminary meeting will be held.\n\n\u201cSome developments are already ongoing. The whole idea is to know the cause of death. The police have moved in speedily. Some of the boys have been arrested which means the cause is already known,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the coroner inquest is to find out, for anyone who died unnaturally in Lagos, how it happened. The suspects are going to be charged as soon as possible. I understand progress is being made.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is just to ensure that it\u2019s not treated like nothing happened. What is important is to find out the cause of death for anyone who died unnaturally. This small boy died with a beating inflicted on him in Lagos.\n\n\u201cEven if the body is not found, you can still conduct an inquest. The fact that he went to die in Delta doesn\u2019t prevent an inquest from being conducted [in Lagos].\u201d\n\nBefore his death, Oromoni had named five students who he claimed attacked him in the dormitory, inflicting internal injuries that later claimed his life.\n\nThe names of the mentioned students and their pictures have since gone viral on social media, with many Nigerians calling for their immediate prosecution.\n\nTHE QUESTION OF PROSECUTING MINORS\n\nThree of the accused, all of whom are believed to be under the age of 18, were detained by the Lagos state police.\n\nHowever, many have expressed concerns about the prospect for prosecution, since the students are minors.\n\nIf the account of the family detailing a physical attack and subsequent chemical poisoning are ascertained during the investigation, Oromoni\u2019s death will be considered a murder case.\n\nThere are special courts and detention facilities catering to offenders as young as the boys if they are found guilty.\n\nSection 319 of the criminal code stipulates that, if the offender has not attained 17 years of age, they shall be ordered to be detained \u201cduring the pleasure of the president\u201d in murder cases.\n\nAfam Osigwe, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said this means the court can neither impose a death or life sentence if the minor is found guilty of murder.\n\nThe lawyer said, in this case, the offender is detained and kept away until the governor orders their release.\n\n\u201cThe law will take its course whether they\u2019re minors or not. Reports put them at a little over 12 years or so. They will be tried but not like adults. The court may keep away the public from it or take steps to protect them,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf found guilty, they\u2019ll be sentenced but they\u2019re not to be kept in the same place as adults. They will be kept in a facility meant for minors. The important thing is that proper investigation is carried out.\n\n\u201cThis way, wrong persons are not charged. It\u2019s important that the police build up a good case to ensure a conviction.\u201d",

          "text": "The novelist Rita Mae Brown once said, \u201cLanguage is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\u201d If this is true, what then does an extinct language mean for its people? It means they have no culture, ancestral value, or true identity. As hyperbolic as this may sound, many languages have already gone extinct and more are predicted to join in the coming years.\n\nMore than 573 languages are extinct. The National Geographic Society says a language dies every two weeks, ceasing to be actively spoken. In Africa alone, at least 52 known languages have experienced either linguicide\u2014the death of a language due to natural or political reasons\u2014or glottophagy, which happens when a smaller language is absorbed in or replaced by a major language.\n\nIn another disturbing report, UNESCO data indicates that if no efforts are made to conserve them, half of the languages currently spoken today will be extinct by the end of the 21st century. How can this be avoided, especially for African languages? Some young Africans living and schooling in America are taking the lead in answering this question through their startup called Madla, an app that helps people learn African languages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMandla, a Zulu and Xhosa word that means power, is an innovative e-learning language app created for those who seek to strengthen their connection with their African roots. The app combines education with gamification to create an enjoyable and effective experience. With the help of predictive AI, Mandla is able to personalise language lessons for all of its users.\n\nHow it started\n\nDuring the winter break of last year, Wenitte Apiou, a then freshman student of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shared the idea to build Madla in a text to Boluwaji Odufuwa, another freshman studying Computer Science at Harvard University.\n\nApiou was born in Burkina Faso but moved to America when he was five. Odufuwa, on the other hand, was born in Nigeria but also moved to America in his early childhood. Because of their shared struggle with speaking and understanding their native language, Apiou\u2019s idea organically resonated with Odufuwa, and the duo launched into action.\n\nGrowing up, Apiou\u2019s family only spoke French\u2014Burkina Faso\u2019s official language\u2014and some English in the household. His parents are from two different ethnic groups: his mother speaks M\u00f2or\u00e9, the most spoken indigenous language in Burkina Faso; and his father speaks Kasem, a minority language spoken only by about 100,000 people in southern Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\n\u201cThe only language I\u2019m fluent in besides English is French, which makes it difficult to communicate with some of my older family members who never went to school and were not able to learn French fluently,\u201d Apiou told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s harder being in the United States as well. The only people that can help would have been my parents, and they did not speak those languages in the house.\u201d\n\nApiou was stuck in-between two foreign languages: French in the house and English everywhere outside the house. This is the reality of many young Africans, especially those who have parents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nEven though the idea had stuck with him since high school, Apiou couldn\u2019t do much because of school work and time barrier. He had some coding skills and had built two apps in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to start building the app and then drop it. So the winter break and the COVID-19 lockdown availed them the time to solve the problem for themselves and millions of young people in America and across the world.\n\nA diverse team building a diverse product\n\nAs the duo built, they realised they needed more diverse hands. After all, Africa has 54 countries and over 3,000 tribes. Building a diverse solution should involve a diverse team, they thought. So they sought more hands.\n\nEmeka Ezike, a sophomore Computer Science student at Harvard University, who also originally came from Nigeria, joined as the CTO. Kwesi Afrifa, born and raised in Ghana and an International student studying Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined to lead the web platform effort. Delanyo Mensah, a sophomore student of Human and Organisational Development at Vanderbilt University, originally from Ghana, joined to lead Madla\u2019s growth and marketing team.\n\n\u201cWe brought a number of smart young Africans to join in the effort\u2014a few engineers and Delanyo, who\u2019s passionately pushing our growth, especially on TikTok where a bunch of our audience are,\u201d said Apiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\nToday, Madla has grown into a 10-man core team. The startup also accepts volunteers that can help create learning content around the languages currently on its platform and upcoming ones.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nMadla currently has more than 15 languages including Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba and Igbo; Ghana\u2019s Twi; Ethiopian\u2019s Amharic; and East Africa\u2019s Swahili on its platform. According to Apiou, the plan is to continue adding more languages until they\u2019ve covered a large extent of African cultures.\n\nAs young founders, the natural thing is to find a way to scale on social media, and that\u2019s what the team has done; they are creating captivating content on social media, especially TikTok, which now houses over a billion users.\n\nThe app is currently growing organically and, according to Apiou, currently has 5,000 registered users, pegged at about 50 signups per day and about three to 400 daily active users.\n\nThe team thinks it\u2019s time to scale their technology and build a more powerful marketing strategy, from organic to paid. But the problem is funding. Apiou said they\u2019ve reached out to hundreds of investors to no avail.\n\nBut why no funding yet?\n\nApiou stated a number of reasons for this. One is \u201cbeing a black college student. In the United States, there aren\u2019t very many people looking to fund someone who has an unproven track record,\u201d he said, agreeing to his lack of experience as a major barrier. \u201cSecond is the domain, edtech. While there is a lot of VC interest in it, it\u2019s relatively new because many people don\u2019t see a path to profitability, or huge billion-dollar success for edtech companies,\u201d Apiou said.\n\nThis statement may not be completely correct, however, as there are a couple of unicorn edtech companies, like Udemy and Coursera, and even Duolingo, which is one of the startup\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe third Apiou raised is about niche: their product focuses on Africa and African languages and culture. He narrated their experience when they went to college pitch competitions. \u201cWe have not won a single pitch competition, despite the fact that\u2014and I mean no disrespect to the other teams\u2014our product has a more natural need and significant traction than some of the teams that beat us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, they have gotten some support from Angel Onuoha, a graduate of Harvard University, ex-Googler, and a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s somewhat popular for his bullish tweets on African tech.\n\nThe team believes that with more funding, they could build more tech stacks, hire more talent, and go full-frontal on their marketing efforts and then compete on a larger scale.\n\nUnlike other language learning apps that are including African languages just to check a diversity-and-inclusion box, Madla\u2019s mission is deeper than educational or entertainment purposes; it\u2019s really about cultural preservation.\n\n\u201cAnd what better way to preserve a culture than to preserve its language?\u201d Apiou asked with the signatory laughter he had kept throughout the call.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

This eliminates the need for merchants to integrate with different systems in order to manage sales and revenues.\n\nCinetPay thus simplifies the process of accepting payments. Its solution, which can be integrated into merchant websites, is used by a wide array of businesses, from e-commerce platforms to digital public services, insurance companies, and schools.\n\nFounded by Idriss Monthe and Daniel Dindji in 2016, CinetPay claims to have processed over 30 million transactions for 350 active merchants in nine countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Guinea.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe seed investment is expected to boost CinetPay\u2019s sales and marketing efforts in the countries it operates across West and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched firsthand as thousands of merchants waste crucial time, even up to 6 months, getting their payment systems in order,\u201d CinetPay CEO and co-founder, Monthe, said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the resources to market and sell our solution across the region.\u201d\n\nFor Flutterwave, backing CinetPay\u2014a startup it\u2019s partnered with since 2019\u2014marks the unicorn\u2019s first direct investment in the francophone Africa region.

These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For me, his name comes to mind whenever I hear or say the words fintech or finance.\n\nFor real? Oh yeah, Olowe has a wealth of experience in finance. He was an early advisor to Wallets Africa, used to be on the TeamApt board, and has spent over a decade in traditional finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Olowe did not study anything finance-related. His first and Master\u2019s degrees were in engineering.\n\nBut despite having an academic background devoid of finance, Olowe thrived in the space. From building an intranet platform at Standard Trust Bank to his data analytics system at Access Bank, he quickly became a force.\n\nHowever, the open banking system is arguably one of his most significant achievements. The system helps fintechs integrate with banks seamlessly, reducing a process that should have taken months to a day.\n\nBut what exactly is open banking, and how did one man get the Central Bank of Nigeria and every commercial bank in the country to \u201clike the idea.\u201d\n\nWell, Olowe took the first step and was surprised by the outcome.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole had a chat with the finance expert, and he dished about his career, life, and the open banking system.\n\nRead: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nAnd the nominees are\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the biggest tech event in West Africa \u2014 Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, we\u2019ve got news for you.\n\nNominees for Techpoint Awards (Nigerian edition) are out!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based mobility giant, GIGM, has launched a payment service for its users. This is the first of many services that the company intends to offer as it moves towards being a one-stop-shop for the needs of its customers.\n\nIn September 2019, the company revealed a slight name change, replacing \u2018Motors\u2019 with \u2018Mobility\u2019 as it looked to expand its offerings. Two years after that, it says it is redefining mobility to mean access rather than just movement.\n\nOver a chat with Techpoint Africa, Okhae Enahoro, the company\u2019s new CEO, said, \u201cWhen you look at the word mobility, it means the ability to move freely. Movement in itself may not necessarily mean physically transporting yourself from one place to another.\n\n\u201cIt just basically means advancement. It can mean growth. So when you look at these definitions, you realise that we\u2019re trying to enable lifestyles, so we want to bring services to people that allow them to do things easily.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, this service will only be available in Nigeria \u2014 GIGM\u2019s headquarters \u2014 and will allow users to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and Internet data. However, there are plans to launch in other African countries over the next few years.\n\nThe beginnings of a super app?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGozem riders (\u201cChampions\u201d). Source: Supplied\n\nThe super app model has gained popularity in emerging economies following the successes of WeChat and Alipay in China. Several startups have sprung up, especially in Asia, to replicate the model.\n\nIn Africa, Opay, Gozem, Safeboda, and Gokada have positioned themselves as super apps with varying degrees of success, and this latest feature could see GIGM becoming the newest entrant in this space.\n\nTypically, super apps start by offering a core service through which they get a foothold and can provide an array of services to the customer.\n\nThis service could be food delivery, transportation, or payments. For GIGM, this could be building on its tech-enabled transportation platform to offer payment services to its users.\n\nHowever, because its services are mainly for long-distance travel, the company would have to include more services than it currently offers to gain more customers.\n\nA look at its mobile app would provide some insight into how this could work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the GIGM app\n\nOne of the options on the app is called Danfo, named after the famous yellow buses in Lagos State. Tapping on it would redirect you to the app store to download the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanfo is the company\u2019s bus-hailing platform that allows users to book intra-city rides. Although the service is not yet live, it provides insights into the company plans and could see it come up against Shuttlers and Treepz.\n\nLite from GIGM is another offering that will enable the company to onboard new users. Nigeria\u2019s fragmented transportation services mean that users cannot travel comfortably over short distances.\n\nWith Lite, the company plans to provide users with the ability to make short journeys outside a city that would ordinarily not be undertaken by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Bolt.\n\nEven with these offerings, ride-hailing could be the fastest way to attract many users and see it come up against Uber and Bolt.\n\nWith the large war chest available to these two startups in the form of venture capital, it would be a considerable challenge for the company. However, if there is any local player capable of pulling this off, it is GIGM.\n\nIn recent years, the company has focused on developing its technology offerings, deploying data across the business. Its understanding of the local business terrain gained over 20 years of operation gives it an advantage that other local companies lack.\n\nFor super apps to thrive, they must have a robust and frequent core use case, a good payment system, and relevant services close to the core use case.\n\nWith its position as a leading transportation service provider and the addition of a payment option, the company looks to be on the right path. However, the new services it offers could play a role in its success or failure.\n\nNigeria\u2019s low smartphone and Internet penetration also mean that more people would be using the Internet or smartphones for the first time every year. Providing these groups with relevant services could hold the key to success.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "\u201cWe like to invest in businesses where the founders are in control.\u201d \u2013 Ian Lessem on HAVA\u00cdC\u2019s investment thesis",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the funding that goes to African startups comes from outside the continent. In 2020, 71% of the money invested in Nigerian startups came from outside the country. It is a similar story in other countries.\n\nIn recent years, however, the number of investors on the continent has increased, and this could be attributed to early startup founders\u2019 successes. Consequently, seeing African investors either lead or make up the majority of investors on a startup\u2019s cap table is fast becoming the norm.\n\nOne of these investors is HAVA\u00cdC, a South Africa-based investment firm. Techpoint Africa had a chat with Ian Lessem, where he explained the firm\u2019s origins and how they make investment decisions. The interview has been reproduced below.\n\nHow did HAVA\u00cdC get started?\n\nSo we started the business about seven or eight years ago, recognising that there was a lot of tech talent coming out of South Africa and places like Kenya and Nigeria, but very little smart capital supporting these businesses. My partners and I, along with the rest of the team, come from what you would call a very traditional investment background, so we\u2019ve worked in investment banks, M&A\u2019s, etc. We know what it takes to scale businesses. We recognised a gap in the market to number one, find these businesses, and help them grow locally and internationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is your investment thesis?\n\nWe invest in early-stage technology companies that solve real-world challenges. So early-stage for us is post-revenue seed up to Series A. Revenue could be pretty small, maybe just one customer. Importantly, we only invest in businesses where we feel we can add value, so typically, we take a strategic role on the board, helping the businesses scale.\n\nNumber two, the businesses need to be tech-enabled and use their platforms to scale locally and internationally. Thirdly, we focus on businesses that solve actual challenges, so we don\u2019t invest in what we call \u2018nice to haves\u2019. An example would be Twitter. Those who invested in the early stages have done very well, but it\u2019s not solving any problems. If you look at our portfolio, we have startups providing financial inclusion. We have many fintech, healthtech, and business productivity companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your average ticket size in these companies?\n\nWe take minority stakes, so we invest from $100,000 to $1,500,000, and we don\u2019t go above 24.9% in the companies. Importantly, we like to invest in businesses where the founders are in control.\n\nBy your standards, what should a startup not be doing?\n\nAt the moment, I\u2019ll say the topical one is a lot of hot money coming in. Some investors don\u2019t have any experience working in Africa and often push the founders to adopt strategies that work elsewhere but not necessarily in Africa.\n\nObviously, different parts of Africa have different nuances so the biggest mistake we\u2019ve seen is founders being caught up in this hot money and taking money from people who don\u2019t have the expertise to give them the help that young businesses need.\n\nAlso, agreeing to chase metrics that may be suitable in other markets but are not ideal in their domestic markets. So you\u2019re doing things because that\u2019s how they are done elsewhere, but it\u2019s not necessarily a smart way to do things locally.\n\nAnother thing is that some entrepreneurs start businesses to solve problems that they or someone they know faced. While that is an excellent place to start because they\u2019re often quite passionate about it, what may be a problem to me may only be my problem; it may not be a problem for other people.\n\nSo what that means is that sometimes entrepreneurs who have not done their research assume that the problems they are solving must be relevant to lots of other people. We often come across businesses that are solving just a small problem, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. But when an entrepreneur says they want to scale into other markets, we may say that problem is not a real problem in those other markets, and doing so would be unrealistic. So I guess it\u2019s essential to understand your market opportunity, and from there, you work out who the right investment partners are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there investment opportunities that you regret passing on?\n\nTo be honest, we do not regret any. I sometimes think when we\u2019re on the fence, it\u2019s probably at that point where a business is servicing a large customer market in its local base, and they are doing quite well from a revenue point of view. Then, the question is can they replicate this in other markets? If we pass on it, it\u2019s because we feel that they can\u2019t or there isn\u2019t a market opportunity in those markets. This is why I wouldn\u2019t say we regret passing over an opportunity.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nThere are many, but in South Africa, it would be hearX, which provides audiology solutions to the mass market using technology. The product is a smartphone-powered hearing aid. It\u2019s called hearScreen, and they\u2019ve successfully expanded into the US, so they\u2019ve got partnerships with Amazon and many other businesses and are selling thousands of these hearing aids across the US. They\u2019re now entering the UK, so that\u2019s a great example of a local company that has expanded into the US and now Europe.\n\nIn West Africa, we invested in Kuda Bank, which has been quite a success story. When we invested in the company, the revenue was quite low; I think they had about 200,000 active users. It\u2019s only been a year and a bit, but those 200,000 customers have grown to over 2 million customers, and they\u2019ve received support from top global investors, including Valar and Tiger Global.\n\nIn East Africa, we have another fintech called Tanda. They provide basic digital financial services to dukas. In South Africa, we call them spaza shops, but they\u2019re just local shops. They have more than 20,000 shops. Through their services, Tanda provides cash in cashouts and has probably become the most prominent provider in East Africa. They\u2019re expanding into other parts of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, etc., so that\u2019s a great success story as well.\n\nHow do you deal with failed investments?\n\nWe probably have scenarios where things have not gone according to plan. One scenario has to do with my point about things working in one market but not in another. So we invested in a business that was one of our earliest investments in South Africa, where it did very well, but when it looked to expand to other markets, it didn\u2019t do as well.\n\nIn that case, we responded by changing the offering to what the US customers wanted, and we split the company. So we started the US business using some of the technology from the business, but in a very different way, so you\u2019d probably call that a pivot. Fortunately for us, we managed to sell that business to Mailchimp in the US, so I guess what could have been a bad story turned out to be a decent story in the end. I guess that would be a product-market fit problem.\n\nAnother one that is a bit more sensitive and difficult would be when founders have quarrelled, and you as an investor have to try and sort this out. The actual product is still very good, but when two people are not getting along very well, that sets a bad tone for everyone else.\n\nWhat trends would you like to see in the startups coming from Africa?\n\nSo we see a lot of technology coming out of South Africa that could be used in the international markets, so we have 15 companies and three international exits in our portfolio. Those 15 companies are not all South African, but they service over 4 million customers in 180 companies worldwide. So while their main operations are in South Africa, Kenya, or Nigeria, they are very much international businesses. So we want to see African businesses succeed internationally.\n\nThe other one is using technology to service a large part of Africa. I guess that\u2019s why fintech seems to get a lot of airtime because you don\u2019t need a physical bank as long as you have a mobile phone and a decent Internet connection. It\u2019s one example, but there are many others \u2013 eCommerce, education, logistics, etc. You don\u2019t need a classroom to teach people. So we hope that more entrepreneurs start taking up the challenge of serving other sectors with a similar impact as fintech.\n\nIf you\u2019re an early-stage entrepreneur with some revenue, HAVA\u00cdC may be willing to invest in you. Simply send an email to info@havaic.com, and someone will be in touch with you.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I think there is a huge room for collaboration, you have a very big role in the real estate sector.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s population is growing fast and we need everyone in Nigeria to have a roof over their heads. We do not want people to end their careers living in rented accommodation, people need to own their own houses because there is a lot of security and social value in owning your own house.\n\n\u201cYou are very important as you operate in an area that is very important to our economy. You have a crucial role to play in the capital market especially as we focus on the Real Estate Investment Trust sector. You also have a huge role to play in the larger housing sector as at the moment we have not been able to harness the full potentials in that sector.\u201d\n\nThe SEC DG disclosed that the Commission values the services that the association provides to the nation and the capital market adding that there is room for collaboration between the Commission and NIESV so that the housing sector can contribute more to GDP as well as grow the economy.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Chairman Association of Capital Market Valuers Mr Chudi Ubosi stated that determining the values of assets of organizations in the capital market is the bedrock for decisions and a helpful tool in a range of work situations.\n\nUbosi said that valuation is useful in mergers, acquisitions and divestment because it helps to price an organization and to estimate and value synergies as well as assess potentials of different strategic options among others.\n\nHe said \u201cAnother useful bye product of conducting asset valuation prior to listing and during the currency of listing is to check asset stripping which we have seen recently in organizations and companies. The resulting documents from valuation will certainly make this impossible as it will make management accountable.\n\n\u201cValuation will also comment on sub-optimal use of asset which can lead to under valuation. Using mainly market approach as rearrangement of asset use can bring out hidden values in the company under question.\n\n\u201cWhen businesses want to raise money, when they need to determine how much should be raised as well as when they approach the negotiating table, valuations are needed in all instances.\u201d\n\nUbosi stated that when there are valuations that have integrity, it will boost investors\u2019 confidence in the market as investors can ascertain that what is being valued is actual and nothing is hidden.\n\nHe stated that the role of Capital Market Valuers in determining the value of the assets of these companies will ensure transparency, accountability and continued enhancement of investor confidence in the market.\n\n\u201cAs SEC recognizes us with insistence that all capital market valuations be undertaken by our members, you will rest assured that anytime an operator wants to capitalize or re-capitalize their assets, the valuation reports done by our members will help engender confidence in the process\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, President and Chairman of Council NIESV, Mr. Emmanuel Wike commended the SEC Management on the huge contribution the capital market is making to the economic development of the country and solicited for the strengthening of collaboration between the Commission and his Institution.",

Lifu of the Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos on an 11-count charge bordering on cybercrimes.\n\nThe suspect was arrested by officers of the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, on August 22, 2020 at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos on his way to Dubai with 2, 863 Automated Teller Machine, (ATM)cards and four Subscriber Identification Module( SIM)cards carefully concealed in parks of Noodles.\n\nHe was subsequently handed over to the EFCC on Thursday, September 10, 2020 by the Deputy Comptroller, Enforcement, NCS, Abudulmumuni Bako, for further investigation and prosecution.\n\nWhile handing over the suspect to the EFCC, Bako, who represented the Customs Area Comptroller, A.Ma\u2019aji, had said: \u201cOfficers of the Nigeria Customs Service at the Departure Hall of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, on August 22, 2020, intercepted the suspect with 2, 863 ATM cards, which he carefully concealed in parks of Noodles.\n\n\u201cThe suspect, who claimed to have come from Kano to Dubai aboard the Emirate Evacuation flight, was seen with someone who was assigned to facilitate his movement through the airport checks.\n\n\u201cThis raised the suspicion of the officers who insisted he should be physically and thoroughly checked after the scan machine had revealed he was carrying parks of noodles. \u201c\n\nIn his response, the Executive Chairman, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, who received the suspect on behalf of the Commission in his capacity as the then Zonal Commander, had assured the Service that the Commission would duly investigate the suspect and any other party that might be involved in the alleged criminal offence.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of possibilities. There is an element of conspiracy, foreign exchange (FOREX) malpractices and money laundering,\u201d he had said.\n\nBawa, who also emphasized the possibility of the suspect being a member of a network, had added that \u201cwe have observed a trend in which unsuspecting Nigerians are lured into opening accounts to be bought at a fee. \u201c\n\nInvestigation revealed that 10 of the 2,863 ATM cards were stolen, as the owners had confirmed losing their cards, which were found in his possession.\n\nIt was further revealed that the remaining ATM cards were handed over to him by some persons in Kano for onward delivery to their contacts in Dubai for monetary benefits.\n\nOne of the counts reads: \u201cThat you, Abubakar Ishaq, on or about 22nd August, 2020 at Lagos, within the judicial division of this Honorable Court, received and retained in your possession 10 ATM cards issued in the card holders, which cards you knew were taken or retained under circumstances which constitute card theft and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 34 of cybercrimes( Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act, 2015\u201d\n\nAnother count reads: \u201cThat you, Abubakar Ishaq, on or about 22nd August , 2020 at Lagos, within the judicial division of this Honorable Court, received an Access bank ATM card issue to one Alamin Bashir Babuga, which you know or ought to know to have been lost and which you retained possession with intent to traffic it to a person other than the card owner and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 33(4) of Cybercrimes( Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act , 2015.\u201d\n\nHe pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charges when they were read to him.\n\nIn view of his plea, the prosecution counsel, S. Sulaiman, asked that the defendants be remanded in the Correctional Service.\n\nThe defense counsel, George Ochima, told the court of a pending application for bail for the defendant.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Lifu granted the defendant bail in the sum of N50m, with two sureties in like sum, who must swear to affidavit of means.\n\nOne of the sureties is to provide land ownership proof in Lagos, while the other must be a civil servant not below Grade Level 14.\n\nThe defendant was also ordered to surrender his travel documents to the court.\n\nThe Judge ordered the defendant to be remanded in the Correctional Centre, Ikoyi pending the fulfillment of his bail conditions.\n\nThe case has been adjourned to February 18, 2022 for commencement of trial.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Lifu of the Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos on an 11-count charge bordering on cybercrimes.\n\nThe suspect was arrested by officers of the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, on August 22, 2020 at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos on his way to Dubai with 2, 863 Automated Teller Machine, (ATM)cards and four Subscriber Identification Module( SIM)cards carefully concealed in parks of Noodles.\n\nHe was subsequently handed over to the EFCC on Thursday, September 10, 2020 by the Deputy Comptroller, Enforcement, NCS, Abudulmumuni Bako, for further investigation and prosecution.\n\nWhile handing over the suspect to the EFCC, Bako, who represented the Customs Area Comptroller, A.Ma\u2019aji, had said: \u201cOfficers of the Nigeria Customs Service at the Departure Hall of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, on August 22, 2020, intercepted the suspect with 2, 863 ATM cards, which he carefully concealed in parks of Noodles.\n\n\u201cThe suspect, who claimed to have come from Kano to Dubai aboard the Emirate Evacuation flight, was seen with someone who was assigned to facilitate his movement through the airport checks.\n\n\u201cThis raised the suspicion of the officers who insisted he should be physically and thoroughly checked after the scan machine had revealed he was carrying parks of noodles. \u201c\n\nIn his response, the Executive Chairman, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, who received the suspect on behalf of the Commission in his capacity as the then Zonal Commander, had assured the Service that the Commission would duly investigate the suspect and any other party that might be involved in the alleged criminal offence.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of possibilities. There is an element of conspiracy, foreign exchange (FOREX) malpractices and money laundering,\u201d he had said.\n\nBawa, who also emphasized the possibility of the suspect being a member of a network, had added that \u201cwe have observed a trend in which unsuspecting Nigerians are lured into opening accounts to be bought at a fee. \u201c\n\nInvestigation revealed that 10 of the 2,863 ATM cards were stolen, as the owners had confirmed losing their cards, which were found in his possession.\n\nIt was further revealed that the remaining ATM cards were handed over to him by some persons in Kano for onward delivery to their contacts in Dubai for monetary benefits.\n\nOne of the counts reads: \u201cThat you, Abubakar Ishaq, on or about 22nd August, 2020 at Lagos, within the judicial division of this Honorable Court, received and retained in your possession 10 ATM cards issued in the card holders, which cards you knew were taken or retained under circumstances which constitute card theft and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 34 of cybercrimes( Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act, 2015\u201d\n\nAnother count reads: \u201cThat you, Abubakar Ishaq, on or about 22nd August , 2020 at Lagos, within the judicial division of this Honorable Court, received an Access bank ATM card issue to one Alamin Bashir Babuga, which you know or ought to know to have been lost and which you retained possession with intent to traffic it to a person other than the card owner and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 33(4) of Cybercrimes( Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act , 2015.\u201d\n\nHe pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charges when they were read to him.\n\nIn view of his plea, the prosecution counsel, S. Sulaiman, asked that the defendants be remanded in the Correctional Service.\n\nThe defense counsel, George Ochima, told the court of a pending application for bail for the defendant.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Lifu granted the defendant bail in the sum of N50m, with two sureties in like sum, who must swear to affidavit of means.\n\nOne of the sureties is to provide land ownership proof in Lagos, while the other must be a civil servant not below Grade Level 14.\n\nThe defendant was also ordered to surrender his travel documents to the court.\n\nThe Judge ordered the defendant to be remanded in the Correctional Centre, Ikoyi pending the fulfillment of his bail conditions.\n\nThe case has been adjourned to February 18, 2022 for commencement of trial.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari; APC National leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and others on Thursday eulogised the qualities of former APC Interim Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande.\n\nThe event was the unveiling the autobiography of Akande, titled: \u201cMy Participations,\u201d held at the Eko Hotel and Suits, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nSpeaking, Buhari said he was duty bound to be at the book presentation because Akande is a decent, truthful and friendly person.\n\nBuhari said his first encounter with him was in 2006 when they wanted to unseat the PDP government and that the effort then came to nothing, but that they did not give up as the nation was going down under PDP.\n\n\u201cHe was always in the thick of things. He emerged as governor of Osun in 1999. He inherited looted treasury, enough challenges to overwhelm a leader and he faced the challenges and overcame most of them. Within one year, he paid all the salaries through his competence,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said in 2003, it was common knowledge that Akande and others fell victims of former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s electoral massacre when he took over the Southwest except Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe fused together, though we failed in 2011, we came back into APC, he was chosen as the chairman, throughout, I found him honest and truthful. Akande has a permanent smile on his face. Students will find this book useful, I recommend this book to them,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Tinubu described Akande as a hero and a man of impeccable character.\n\nHe said with men like Akande with selfless character, the lives of Nigerians would be made better.\n\nTinubu said Akande is a key light in the nation\u2019s political story and that his life has shown what a public figure of a nation like Nigeria ought to be.\n\n\u201cFrom a humble beginning, he rose through hard work and perseverance to th top, he did not walk th easy way but through hard work. He tutored himself to become a qualified accountant at the age of 22,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former governor of Lagos Stat said without Akande, the merger that brought about APC would not have been possible.\n\n\u201cWithout Akande, that merger would not have come to pass. We owe him gratitude for this and this led to Buhari\u2019s victory in 2015. We have been fellow travelers in the journey to democracy,\u201d he added.\n\nLagos Governor, Sanwo-Olu described Akande as a beacon of democracy and a selfless leader.\n\n\u201cHe is a man of great respect and it is not surprising that his autobiography is being witnessed by politicians and others. His name is synonymous with honesty, loyalty and so on.\n\n\u201cAll his life, he has lived consistently by those values, he has fully paid his dues. The standard of his fairness and equity set him as a man of integrity. He made sacrifice for the birth of APC. The book is deeply rooted in politics. The book is a timely offering. We are confident he still has many more years to go,\u201d he said.\n\nMinister of Science, Technology and Innovations, Ogbonnaya Onu said Akande made important contribution to APC.\n\n\u201cAkande did so much for the APC that he deserved every honour that can be given to him. Akande is a unique personality who deserved to be celebrated, he worked very hard and determined to succeed in life. Through home studies and correspondence he worked hard to become an accountant.\n\n\u201cThis man stood by whatever he believed in, his honesty saved him several times in his life. His life shows that our nation is a land of opportunity. He was born poor but never allowed it to dissuade him. His story showed that one future is not determined by one\u2019s background. It showed Nigeria has a bright future, our nation can benefit from th life of Akande,\u201d Onu stated.",

          "title": "CJN talks tough: Enough of judges\u2019 harassment, let no one test our will",
          "text": "Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Tanko Muhammad has warned that the judiciary would no longer tolerate harassment and embarrassment of its officials from anyone or agency of government.\n\nHe also said testing the will of judicial officers would come with dire consequences to bear.\n\nCJN Muhammad sounded the warning Wednesday at the special session marking the official commencement of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2021/2022 legal year.\n\nThe high point of the event was the conferment of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) on 72 legal practitioners at the Supreme Court Abuja.\n\nJustice Muhammad spoke against the backdrop of the invasion of a Justice of Supreme Court, Mary Odili\u2019s Abuja residence during the legal year by some armed security operatives.\n\nThe residence was invaded following a purported search warrant from a controversial source.\n\nThe CJN said: \u201cUnfortunate occurrences blighted our joy and presented some pensive moments to contend with.\u201d\n\nSounding visibly angry, Muhammad said: \u201cOn a very sad note, I must say, we were jolted with the embarrassing news of the invasion of the official residence of one of our brother Justices, Hon Justice Mary Peter Odili on Friday, October 29 by men suspected to be security operatives, acting on a search warrant.\n\n\u201cThe said warrant was purportedly obtained from an Abuja Magistrate Court under questionable circumstances.\n\n\u201cI must make it known to all and sundry that we have had enough dosage of such embarrassment and harassment of our judicial officers across the country and we can no longer take any of such shenanigans.\n\n\u201cThe silence of the judiciary should never be mistaken for stupidity or weakness.\n\n\u201cBy the nature of our work, we are conservative but not conquered species and should not be pushed further than this by any individual, institution or agency of the government. With time, those taking judiciary as a mere weakling will soon realize that it is from the calmest seas we often experience the fiercest storms.\n\n\u201cThe time to oppress, suppress and intimidate judicial officers is gone. No one, irrespective of his or her status or position in the country, should test our will because the consequences of such unwarranted provocation will be too dire to bear.\n\n\u201cWe shall begin to resist any clandestine attempt to silence or ridicule us to oblivion. Nigeria, to the best of my knowledge is not a lawless society. We should begin to do things that will project us favourably and rightly too, to the international community.\n\n\u201cNo law permits anyone to invade, subdue or overawe any Nigerian citizen in his or her residence with a flimsy, fraudulently obtained search warrant.\n\n\u201cWe are making efforts now to ensure that henceforth, every search or arrest warrant must be issued with the knowledge and approval of the Chief Judge of the respective State or Federal High Court as the case may be.\u201d\n\nACJA\n\nOn the implementation of the provisions in the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015, the number one judicial officer said this has \u201cremained a major clog in the wheel of progress.\u201d\n\nIn a rhetoric manner, he queried: \u201cAre we adhering to these provisions and the general tenets of the Act?\u201d\n\nCommenting on the general standard of living of Nigerians under the current dispensation, Muhammad counselled the three arms of government to chart a way out.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to use this occasion to call on the executive, legislature and judiciary to work assiduously to better the lot of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cIt is the insensitivity of some of our conducts as leaders that have brought us to where we are today.\n\n\u201cI urge all the stakeholders of the Nigerian project to reconcile with our conscience\u2026and align our actions with its dictates in order to evolve an egalitarian society.\u201d\n\n2021 Legal Year\n\nSpeaking on the number of cases handled, the CJN said notwithstanding the impact of the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and a better part of 2021, a total of 746 corruption-related cases were dispensed with.\n\nHe also listed a number of forfeited non-cash recoveries to include 51 automobiles, 16 real estates, 11 barges/tug boats and two schools in the outgone year.\n\nOther non-cash forfeited assets, he added, include aircraft, seven filling stations, 48 real estates and 149 vehicles amongst several others.\n\nFurthermore, the CJN said in 2021, some 1,143 suspects were convicted for various corruption and financial related crimes.\n\nGiving the specific cases handled by the apex court, he said a total of 681 cases comprising motions and appeals were entertained.\n\nThe CJN, who said \u201cI will confidently say that this scorecard is impressive,\u201d further stated that \u201cout of these, we heard 312 civil, 95 criminal and five political, making a total of 412 motions.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the court considered a total of 269 appeals, comprising 139 civil, 102 criminal and 28 political. A total number of 216 judgements were delivered in the year.\u201d\n\nSANs urge NJC on courage\n\nAlso in a remark, the Body of Senior Advocates of Nigeria (BOSAN) urged \u201cthe NJC to be courageous enough to approach the legislature directly with its budget estimates.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the group, Mr Adegboyega Awomolo, who said this observed that the current practice of subjecting the judiciary\u2019s budget proposals to the executive arm for onward transmission to the Parliament for appropriation won\u2019t augur well for the third arm of government.\n\nThe body, which condemned the raid on Odili\u2019s residence, also admonished the court to \u201cstamp its feet for the independence of the Nigerian judiciary,\u201d even as they called for improved welfare, security and safety of judicial officers.\n\nAnd in his remarks, President Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Olumide Akpata faulted the recruitment process of judges, just as he called for protection of judges from danger.\n\nAkpata, who recalled with sadness the raid on Justice Odili\u2019s residence, urged that perpetrators of the act must be brought to justice.\n\nHe also liked the raid to the U.S. Capitol scenario January 2020 where riotous supporters of former President Donald Trump violently protested over disputed polls.\n\nMr Olumide queried the process for the recruitment of judges, saying it is shrouded in \u201copaqucity.\u201d\n\nThe NBA urged the NJC to tackle issues of indiscipline amongst judges.",

          "text": "Plans by President Muhammadu Buhari to amend some of the tax laws in the country for improved revenue generation came to the fore Wednesday during consideration and passage for second reading of the 2021 Finance Bill.\n\nThe bill, which was received by the Senate Tuesday, got expeditious consideration by scaling first and second reading at plenary Wednesday.\n\nOn personal Income Tax, the Finance Bill 2021 by Buhari requires banks in the country to demand from their customers evidence of their Tax Identification Number (TIN) before opening bank accounts for individuals.\n\nIn the same vein, those who already hold account(s) must provide their (TIN) to continue operating their accounts.\n\nThe Financial Bill, as proposed by Buhari, also seeks amendment to clarify that pension contributions no longer require the approval of the Joint Tax Board (JTB) to be tax-deductible.\n\nThis is as the proposed law also seeks to remove the tax exemption on withdrawals from pension schemes except where the following prescribed conditions are met: first is a Child relief package of up to N2, 500 per child up to a maximum of 4) and a dependent relief (N2, 000 per dependent for a maximum of 2) are to be deleted.\n\nOn Value Added Tax (VAT), Buhari introduces VAT exemption on group reorganisations on the conditions that the sale is to a Nigerian company and it is for the better organisation of the trade or business.\n\nAnother condition given by the president is that the entities involved are part of a recognized group of companies 365 days before the transaction, and the relevant assets are not disposed earlier than 365 days after the transaction.\n\nThe current practice is that companies send an approval request letter under CITA Section 29(9) to the FIRS, and include a VAT exemption request, even though there is technically no basis for this in the VAT Act.\n\nIn his lead debate, Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi said the Finance Bill seeks to introduce sweeping changes to the tax laws covering seven different tax laws with significant positive impact on investment and ease of paying taxes especially for MSMEs.\n\nThe proposed tax law however made provisions for various penalties for defaulters.\n\nBuhari increased the penalty for VAT late filing of returns to N50, 000 for the first month and N25, 000 for subsequent months of failure.\n\nHe also increased the penalty for failure to register for VAT to NGN 50,000 for the first month of default and NGN 25,000 for each subsequent month of default.\n\nThe penalty for failure to notify FIRS of change in company address to be reviewed upwards to N50,000 for the first month of default and N25,000 for each subsequent month of default.\n\nThis penalty also covers failure to notify FIRS of permanent cessation of trade or business.\n\nThe proposed Finance Bill by Buhari also recommends penalty for operators whose responsibility it is to deduct the taxes.\n\nFailure to make deduction will attract penalty of 10% of the tax not deducted, plus interest at the prevailing monetary policy rate of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nBuhari, however, removed all the conditions attached to tax exemption on gratuities making it unconditionally tax exempt.\n\nUnder the proposed Finance Bill, the duties currently performed by the Joint Tax Board (JTB) as relates to administering the Personal Income Tax Act, will now be performed by the FIRS.",

I wish to reiterate that despite these challenges, our administration is very determined to ensure that the Navy is well supported to achieve its statutory responsibilities.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that the Government will continue to support the ideals of the Nigerian Navy in the performance of its constitutional duties.

With time, those taking the judiciary as a mere weakling will soon realise that it is from the calmest seas, we often experience the fiercest storms.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Siege On Justice Odili\u2019s House: 7 Questions Nigerians Need Answered\n\nLawless Society?\n\nAccording to the CJN, the era of oppressing, suppressing, and intimidating judicial officers is long gone and such action will no longer be condoned.\n\nHe warned that no one, irrespective of his or her status or position in the country, should test the will of the judiciary, saying the consequence of such unwarranted provocation would be too dire to bear.\n\nJustice Muhammad stated that the judiciary would begin to resist any clandestine attempt to silence or ridicule judicial officers to oblivion.\n\nHe disclosed that they were making efforts to ensure that search and arrest warrants must be issued with the knowledge and approval of the Chief Judge of the respective state or federal high court going forward.\n\n\u201cNigeria, to the best of my knowledge, is not a lawless society,\u201d the CJN avowed. \u201cWe should begin to do things that will project us favourably and rightly, too, to the international community.\n\n\u201cNo law permits anyone to invade, subdue or overawe any Nigerian citizen in his or her residence with a flimsy, fraudulently obtained search warrant.\u201d",

          "text": "Gunmen in Zamfara went on a rampage recently as they blocked a major highway in the state for at least five straight days, locals told Channels Television on Wednesday.\n\nThe security situation on the highway \u2013 which links three local government areas Shinkafi, Moriki (in Zurmi), and Kaura-Namoda \u2013 has left travellers in fear after the armed men were reported to have killed six motorists.\n\nSources said the gunmen, who blocked the road to protest the closure of the cattle market in Shinkafi LGA, also abducted many passengers and set several vehicles on fire.\n\nAlthough the police authorities in Zamfara confirmed the incidents, they stated that the Shinkafi\u2013Moriki\u2013Kaura-Namoda Road has since been cleared and is safe for use.\n\nAn Indigene of Shinkafi, Aliyu Guraguri, told Channels Television that the gunmen were angry due to the closure of the cattle market and vowed that nobody would have access to other markets in the LGA having cut off the area from Kaura-Namoda and Gusau, the state capital.\n\n\u201cThere have been incessant attacks along the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attacks started around Tuesday last week when they started stopping vehicles, setting them ablaze, kidnapping people, and killing some at the gunpoint.\n\n\u201cThey have burnt down six vehicles, killed six motorists, kidnapped several others, and caused an accident involving a trailer carrying potatoes from Shinkafi market. The bandits were saying since the cattle market was closed down, nobody will have access to other markets in Shinkafi.\u201d\n\nAttack On Farmers\n\nGuraguri lamented that the security situation in Shinkafi has worsened, blaming it on the suspension of telecommunications networks in the area.\n\nLocals said the bandits also attacked Birnin Yero community in Shinkafi on Tuesday afternoon when they shot at farmers who were at their farmlands to cultivate crops.\n\nElsewhere, a group of armed men invaded Shinkafi town on Wednesday morning and forcefully left with a nursing mother, Aisha Bature, and her one-year-old daughter. A local vigilante was shot dead by the bandits.\n\nThe victim\u2019s relative, Inno Bature, stated that the assailants have yet to contact the family to make any demand for ransom.\n\n\u201cIt was around 1am when they attacked her (Aisha) inside her house. They (the bandits) have yet to contact the family for ransom. She is an orphan and may Allah return her safely,\u201d said Inno.\n\n\u2018Not Under Siege\u2019\n\nConfirming the incidents, the Commissioner of Police in Zamfara, Ayuba Elkanah, explained that the command has deployed a tactical team to the troubled road.\n\n\u201cThe situation along Kaura-Namoda-Shinkafi road is under control because some few days ago, we had challenges where these bandits took advantage of some locations to attack commuters,\u201d he told Channels Television. \u201cNow, we have put our heads together with other security chiefs and deployed enough security operatives along the road.\n\n\u201cNow the road is free for movement. We have deployed about seven operational vehicles working there morning till evening. Commuters are now using the road. Shinkafi road is not under siege.\u201d\n\nElkanah also confirmed the attack on farmers in Birnin Yero, saying the bandits requested petrol from two farmers which they declined before they opened fire on them.\n\nHe added that the farmers were injured, but they were taken to the hospital by the security operatives deployed in the area.\n\nThe police commissioner urged the people of Zamfara to continue to support the police and the government, especially in view of the measures put in place to restore peace in all parts of the state.\n\nShinkafi, Zurmi, and Bukkuyum LGAs are the only areas where telecommunications services have yet to be restored.",

I know he is doing very well on road construction and other sectors; more attention should also be given to security.\n\n\u201cThe governor was the first to visit me after my arrival. He showed me what he is doing in the state like the Atan-Agbara road. He is determined to construct the Agbado road. He is also doing massive housing projects to take care of the middle class. Ogun is the fastest growing state in Nigeria because the governor is taking the advantage of our closeness to Lagos\u201d, Osoba added.\n\nHe further lauded the present administration on its land reform programme and noted that apart from discouraging land speculators, it would allow the state reap huge benefit from its land resource.\n\nHe, however, urged Governor Abiodun to remain resolute in executing sustainable projects across the state.\n\nWhile thanking the Governor for all his support and words of encouragement, especially visiting him in the hospital before the surgery, Osoba, said, \u201cdon\u2019t listen to rumours. Do all that you can. No government can do everything. My prayer is that you will leave Ogun state better than you met it\u201d.\n\nHe appreciated the state executive members for supporting the governor in his quest to reposition the state, assuring that he will always support the governor through words of advice when and where necessary, submitting that \u201cthe success of the present administration is my success\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Tokunbo Talabi, described the former governor as an elder statesman who has the interest of the state at heart\n\nHe appreciated God for a successful surgery, declaring that Ogun is happy to see him back on his feet.\n\n\u201cWe are happy for your quick recovery. And you are recuperating very well. We have reasons to thank God.

          "text": "The World Food Programme (WFP) has suspended distribution of food aid in two northern Ethiopian towns after gunmen looted its warehouses.\n\nLooters from rebel Tigrayan forces held aid staff at gunpoint in the town of Kombolcha, the United Nations said.\n\nThey stole large quantities of essential food supplies \u2013 including some for malnourished children.\n\nNorthern Ethiopia is facing mass starvation amid an ongoing civil war between Tigrayan and government forces.\n\nAfter more than a year of fighting, more than nine million people are in need of critical food supplies, the UN says.\n\nA spokesman for the UN, which runs the WFP, said its staff there had faced \u201cextreme intimidation\u201d during days of looting.\n\nHe added: \u201cSuch harassment of humanitarian staff by armed forces is unacceptable. It undermines the ability of the United Nations and all of our humanitarian partners to deliver assistance when it is most needed.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman also accused government troops of commandeering three WFP humanitarian trucks and using them for their own purposes.\n\nThat led to the decision to halt food distribution in Kombolcha and nearby Dessie, two strategic towns in the northern Amhara region that sit on the road to the capital Addis Ababa. The Tigrayan rebels have not commented on the allegations that their fighters stole food aid.\n\nThe Ethiopian government had recently announced that it had recaptured the towns from the Tigray rebels. But the rebels said the army had only recovered areas they had abandoned.\n\nFighting broke out over a year ago between government troops and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which dominated Ethiopia for decades and now controls Tigray.\n\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops into the Tigray region to quash the TPLF after he said it had attacked army camps.\n\nBut the rebels mounted a comeback, recapturing most of Tigray and advancing into the neighbouring regions of Amhara and Afar.\n\nThe conflict has killed thousands of people, displaced more than two million and driven hundreds of thousands into famine-like conditions, according to UN figures.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Ned Price said the humanitarian catastrophe in northern Ethiopia remains an \u201cabsolute priority\u201d for the United States.\n\nHe called on both sides to negotiate an end to the conflict and allow aid to reach those in need.\n\nThis is yet another example of the dangerous environment humanitarian workers have to operate under in Ethiopia.\n\nSince the beginning of the conflict a year ago, 28 humanitarians have been killed, making the country one of the most dangerous for aid workers, according to the UN.\n\nThen there\u2019s the red tape. For months now, aid agencies have been pleading with the Ethiopian government to cut bureaucracy and allow more humanitarian access.\n\nBut so far only a fraction of what is urgently needed is getting to people in the Amhara, Afar and Tigray regions. At least 100 trucks are required in these regions daily \u2013 but only a trickle is arriving there despite millions starving.\n\nAid agencies are also facing fuel and cash shortages, which they need to continue operations.\n\nThis suspension will no doubt exacerbate the worsening humanitarian crisis.\n\nAlready 400,000 people are living in famine like conditions and if the forced suspension is prolonged, this will lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.",

          "text": "One Spanish newspaper called it Barcelona\u2019s \u201cresignation from the football elite\u201d as their dramatic decline culminated in a generational event \u2013 being knocked out of the Champions League before Christmas.\n\nBarca\u2019s 3-0 defeat at Bayern Munich, who had nothing to play for having won the group already, saw them finish third, behind Benfica.\n\nMidfielder Sergio Busquets, speaking to DAZN, said: \u201cWe feel very bad right now. We\u2019re in a tough, difficult situation. We got ourselves into this mess and it hurts a lot.\u201d\n\nThe last time they were not in the Champions League knockout stages was 2003-04, which was also their last season in the Uefa Cup/Europa League. They were eliminated by Celtic.\n\nThe last time they failed to qualify from a Champions League group was 2000, when Leeds finished above them. Barca have won the tournament four times since then.\n\nSpanish website AS said: \u201cBarca staged their resignation from the football elite in a display of all their shortcomings when they fell without complaint against a Bayern Munich that, again in third gear and without giving the feeling of wanting to humiliate, dislodged Barca 3-0 with the attitude of a tired tiger who is lazy to hunt a baby gazelle, but does what nature expects of him.\u201d\n\nNow they drop into the Europa League knockout round play-off. That is a game against a Europa League group runner-up for the right to play the group winners in the last 16.\n\nPerhaps most damning, former Real Madrid midfielder Steve McManaman suggested on BT Sport demotion to the Europa League might be a good thing as winning it would mean they qualify for the Champions League next season.\n\nThey are currently seventh in La Liga, having recently replaced Ronald Koeman with club legend Xavi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a damning result and they had chances to make it worse,\u201d Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo told Movistar.\n\nAraujo was one of four players who usually play in central defence who played the final hour in Barca\u2019s back four.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we didn\u2019t not qualify because of this game but because of what we did in the other games,\u201d he continued.\n\nWhat happened in the other games was two more 3-0 defeats and precisely two goals \u2013 both against rock bottom Dynamo Kyiv.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that, right now, we\u2019re not among the best teams in Europe,\u201d said Araujo.\n\n\u201cIf we were, we\u2019d have qualified. Our objective now is to win the Europa League. We have to go out to compete and try to win it.\u201d\n\nLionel Messi has scored five goals for PSG in the Champions League this season and Antoine Griezmann four for Atletico Madrid \u2013 both players left Barca in the summer\n\nBarcelona\u2019s squad is a combination of ageing legends, players who would not have got near the great Barca teams and talented youngsters.\n\nThey famously lost their all-time top scorer Lionel Messi and several other first-team players in the summer as part of a financial crisis they are still in the middle of.\n\nFormer Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole said on BT Sport: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there are three players \u2013 outside the young players \u2013 they\u2019d want to keep hold of. They simply can\u2019t compete in the Champions League with that group of players.\u201d\n\nThis was their seventh defeat of the season in all competitions. They are 16 points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid after 15 games.\n\nSpanish football journalist Pete Jenson told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cI don\u2019t think people believed in the miracle that was needed tonight.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a gap now between the best teams in Europe and Barcelona. They\u2019re in a different league now in the Europa League and I don\u2019t think too many of their supporters think they can even win that.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got some serious issues looming \u2013 sponsorship deals are running out and they\u2019ve got financial implications to deal with too.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t talk about it but they were heavily failing two or three seasons ago; it was Messi that was keeping them afloat and in the competitions.\u201d\n\nSpanish newspaper website Marca led with the headline \u2018Europa League embarrassment\u2019.\n\n\u201cBarca is still trapped in time. The nightmare began after 2-8 in Lisbon [Bayern\u2019s 2020 quarter-final win over Barca] and continues to this day after falling in Munich and being relegated to the Europa League.\u201d\n\nBarcelona have excellent youngsters scattered throughout their team \u2013 but they need to add to their quality if they are to reach the elite again.\n\nGavi, 17, Ansu Fati and Pedri, both 19, are all senior Spain internationals. Pedri was named the best young player of 2021 in France Football\u2019s recent Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony.\n\nThere have been some promising signs in terms of performance since they hired former captain Xavi, 41, from Qatari side Al Sadd after sacking Koeman.\n\nSpanish football journalist Jenson said: \u201cEven after five games it\u2019s clear to see that Xavi has got aspects of Pep Guardiola in him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the charisma and a clear vision. But ultimately if you haven\u2019t got the players then you can\u2019t put that into action.\u201d\n\nEx-Liverpool striker Peter Crouch said on BT Sport: \u201cThey\u2019ve got the right man in charge. He knows the club inside out and knows how the youth academy works.\n\n\u201cTheir future is youth because they don\u2019t have money to buy players like they have. They have to build from young players up.\n\n\u201cThey have some good ones but it\u2019s not going to be a quick process \u2013 it could be five years.\u201d",
