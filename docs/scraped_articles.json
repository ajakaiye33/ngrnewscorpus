          "text": "Eight states of the federation have failed to access the N377.07m earmarked for Special Needs Education by the Federal Government through the Universal Basic Education Commission, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nThe fund is lying fallow despite the poor state of special needs schools in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, about 15 per cent of the world\u2019s population lives with disabilities.\n\nThe National Population Commission gave the total number of people living with disabilities in Nigeria as 19 million in its 2018 statistics.\n\nWhile the Federal Government allocated a special intervention fund, official documents from UBEC revealed that eight states currently did not access N377.07m as of March 7, 2022.\n\nThe breakdown showed that in 2009, Ogun and Ondo states did not access N7, 000 each.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2016, Edo and Imo states did not access N47, 942,799.68.\n\nIn 2017, the commission noted that Edo and Imo states again, failed to access N30, 400,600 each.\n\nThe number of states who failed to pay counterpart funds in 2018 increased when the commission noted that Abia, Adamawa, Bauchi, Edo, Imo and Zamfara states did not access N36, 727,914.50 each.\n\nUBEC did not give figures for 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nIt, however, noted that as of March 7, 2022, a total of N377,070,337.27 was not accessed due to the failure to pay counterpart funding with the state governments of Edo and Imo leading after failing to access N115,071,314.15.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with The PUNCH, a special needs education advocate, Yusuf Balogun, noted that the failure of states to access special intervention grants hinders special needs education in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is a considerable limit to what advocates or individuals running Non-Governmental Organisations can do independently to ensure that special needs education becomes a thing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe failure of states to access these special intervention grants is a core hindrance to thorough, efficient special needs education in the country. Quite a lot of advocates want to intervene; they put in their funds and it gets to a point that strains and pains come.\u201d\n\nAnother special needs education advocate and convener, CareerEdu Foundation, Toluwalase Adeniyi, said, \u201cIf these states access these funds, they can easily find ways to get equipment, things that will make learning for these children easier.\n\n\u201cEducation for special needs is not simple; it is not just about learning ABC. That is why we talk about the quality of the teachers.\n\n\u201cIt is a glorified service; there are teachers who want to get involved but the government is not ready to pay much. It is a sector that if not talked about, they (government) might not even remember it.\u201d\n\nSo far, only 1,177 full-fledged special needs schools exist in the country with Kano (153), Kaduna (79) and Lagos (75); being the three states having the highest number of special needs schools in the country.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "As encomium continues to pour in, the Chairman of Executive Group and Member of Board of Trustees, Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF) and Caleb University, Dr Ayo Ogunsan, has hailed the Founder and General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Folorunso Kumuyi, on his 81st birthday.\n\nThe educationist, entrepreneur cum public servant, in a press statement issued recently, described the octogenarian as \u201ca man with a coat of my colours too dynamic to express in mere words.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cBaba is more than a spiritual father. He is also my adviser, mentor and leader; a God-sent to me, in actual fact and if I must not mince words. I can jolly well label him as a man with a coat of my colours too dynamic to express in mere words. Words will fail me, still.\n\n\u201cOne soon wonders if baba, at 81, is ever getting older because he is still as agile as a youth. At such age, baba still tours the length and breath of Nigeria and the rest of the world for evangelistic outreaches targeted at leading as many sinners to Calvary, through miracle crusades backed by God with numerous testimonies and signs following.\n\n\u201cI salute the man of God who led me to God when I was just a wretched sinner without any direction for destiny in life. I am glad that baba was instrumental to the salvation of my soul, on that fateful day, dated November 24, 1990. I dare not forget.\n\n\u201cA pastor, evangelist, author of tens of books and a former lecturer of Mathematics at the University of Lagos; I have always known Pastor Kumuyi as a big dreamer who then makes himself readily available to God for use. Now only a handful of his type exists on earth.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of my entire family and the entire management of Executive Group, let me heartily say happy birthday to a highly influential man of global standards, who possesses an unflinching desire for holy living and soul winning. May God continue to enlarge you on every side, daddy. We love you!\u201d\n\nBorn on June 6, 1941, Pastor William Folorunso Kumuyi hails from Erin-Ijesha, Osun State.",

This gives us a lot of confidence but it also comes with its challenges.\u201d\n\nHe said that in the circumstances, in order to prevent any post-convention acrimonies and also reduce noticeable anxiety among members on the possible outcome of the process, the party leadership has recommended the intensification of consultation and consensus building to reduce the number of aspirants as it approaches the convention, which commences Monday , June 6, 2022.\n\nThe President said in order to further support the efforts of the party, he has admonished the aspirants to consult among themselves and with the party, so that the objective of the recommendation by the leadership would be actualized.\n\nAnd as members of the National Advisory Council of the APC, the President says he recognizes the fact that they all have diverse interests, spheres of influence and expectations. \u201cYou similarly possess the collective ability to ensure our victory at the 2023 polls by strengthening the stability and unity of the party.\n\n\u201cMy charge and appeal to all of you, therefore, is to reach out to your various spheres of influence to actively promote the spirit of consultation and consensus building so that a formidable candidate for the 2023 Presidential elections would emerge from the convention. Our citizens do not expect less from us.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari assured, as he did to the Governors and the aspirants, that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would lead the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201ctill we successfully choose our candidate for the 2023 presidential elections and record our third straight victory, thereafter, by God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nResponding on behalf of the National Advisory Council (hitherto known as Board of Trustees) members, former Internal Affairs Minister and Senator, Major General Mohammed Magodo (retd), former Osun State Governor and first Interim National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, and former Senate President, Chief Ken Nnamani, thanked the President for the consultative meetings, and commended him for the great service he had rendered to the country, particularly in the areas of agriculture and infrastructure.\n\nThey were unanimous that with hard work and a united front, the APC would win the presidential election billed for February next year, as well National Assembly, governorship, and State Assembly polls.",

          "title": "African lawmakers chart new path for continental growth",
          "text": "A forum of Africa\u2019s heads of parliaments, a brainchild of Nigeria\u2019s Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, met recently in Abuja to chart a fresh path for a continent bogged down by humongous debt burden, diseases, hunger and bad governance. TONY AKOWE reports\n\nOne of the objectives for the establishment of the Conference of Speakers and Heads of African Parliaments was to help governments across the continent fight against bad governance. To this, lately is added, debt cancellation.\n\nUndoubtedly, the continent has suffered a plague of bad rulers. While Africans heading global bodies have continued to demonstrate credibility and capacity to deliver, this has yet to cascade to the continent, as corruption, insurrections, diseases, among others, have continued to ravage Africa and its peoples.\n\nWhen the Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, mooted the idea of a Conference of African Speakers and Heads of Parliaments, his colleagues from across the continent keyed in. Little wonder, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, in his keynote address at the opening forum, described the maiden event as a true expression of democracy because it represented the assembly of African peoples\u2019 representatives.\n\nAt the event, Osinbajo canvassed a truly African synergy, adding that \u201conly this could engender strong and visionary leadership.\u201d The Vice President believed that the COVID-19 pandemic provided the opportunity for African leaders and parliamentarian to show strong will in addressing the health needs of the continent and prepare the continent to develop appropriate response for future health challenges as the pandemic exposed the decay in health infrastructures across the continent; even though Africa witnessed far less deaths than other continents.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on economies across the world, destabilising health systems, upending supply chains, disrupting industries and led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.\u201d He argued that records available from the World Bank revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic successfully pushed 26 to 40 million people into extreme poverty on the continent. Osinbajo urged the forum to work with the executive arm of government on the continent to boost the relatively weak economic situation.\n\nHe disclosed that the Nigerian government rolled out a stimulus package of about $7billion (about N2.3 trillion) to stabilise the economy, adding that the implications of the huge deficits from these supplementary budgets must have kept legislatures and the executive awake at night, but many realised and performed these hugely risky but historical assignments.\n\nFor him, a post-COVID economic recovery strategy for Africa must go beyond efforts of individual countries to forging greater collaboration and integration to drive sustainable economic growth and recovery across the African continent. To achieve this, he said: \u201cour parliaments have a central role to play. It is to them that the power to enact laws, oversee government budgeting and international borrowing belongs. And there are many opportunities for their proactive collaborative intervention. A crucial concern for all African economies is how to improve liquidity, reduce the debt burden and improve our balance of payments positions, especially in the wake of the huge damage done to our finances by the pandemic.\u201d\n\nStressing the need for debt cancellation, Osinbajo said one of the key issues discussed and agreed to at the preparatory meeting for this inaugural meeting was debt cancellation for African countries, and this is already gaining considerable traction. \u201cA practical initiative introduced in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19 was the new SDR (Special Drawing Rights) reallocation of $650billion, which was implemented in August 2021. The allocation improved our balance of payments position by increasing the share of SDRs in the reserve assets of our countries, thereby providing direct liquidity without raising our debt burdens. So, I think that African countries speaking in one voice can seek more SDR support vehicles, such as the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility (LSF), a trust for middle-income countries, multilateral and regional development banks as well as the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).\u201d\n\nPresenting a paper on gender-inclusive budgeting and planning in the COVID-19 era, UN Women Country Representative to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Beatrice Eyong, said well-structured and resourced parliament is essential to a vibrant democracy, maintaining peace, upholding the rule of law and human rights, advancing gender equality and youth participation, increasing economic prosperity, and promoting social justice. Parliaments\u2019 growing legislative, oversight and representative responsibilities in these areas imply that all citizens have a vital stake in the institution, she said.\n\nShe argued further that there was a strong desire by many parliaments on the continent and beyond to develop their capacities in response to the growing expectations of people for more efficient and effective service delivery from their representatives. She said: \u201cGender inclusive or responsive planning and budgeting can enable parliaments to achieve these expectations and thereby contribute to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Experiences from previous pandemics and large-scale shocks show that these crises often affect men and women differently. COVID 19 was not different.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, parliaments have a key role to play in every step that needs to be taken to address the key variables affecting the continent and its people. She advocated for strong parliaments with strategic leadership, adding that the speakers should enact gender-responsive legislations that provide a favourable legislative and policy environment for gender equality and gender inclusive or responsive planning and budgeting as well as women\u2019s political participation.\n\nShe argued further that \u201csince parliaments should oblige ministerial budgets to provide evidence of mainstreaming gender in their policies, programmes, and budgets, parliaments should follow up through studies carried out with specific GRB tools if the needs of the various social groups they represent are being satisfied on a yearly basis have been included in development planning and budgeting\u201d\n\nThe representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Nigeria, Mohammed Yahya, said the global agency recognises the central role that Parliaments and Houses of Assembly play in advancing national development agendas and its democratic values, considering the fact that parliaments as platforms of elected representatives of citizens have a critical role to play in advancing people-centered development, promoting peace, inclusive governance and advancing a nation\u2019s value system.\n\nHe stressed that \u201chuman capital development is a process of building skills, expertise, and innovation that allows the individual to do their task more productively. In other words, it is the aggregate of investments in key areas such as health, education, training, and talent migration that have propensity of enhancing productivity in the labour market. As we all know, the citizens that parliamentarians represent are the greatest assets of any country, thus they must be invested in order to propagate the development of any nation.\u201d\n\nProffering the ways forward, the UNDP chief canvassed \u201csound advocacy for policies and institutional reforms that position the health sector as a core aspect of social economic transformation. In this regard, there is a need for parliaments, in playing its oversight role, to pay attention to incentivising the systems to retain health sector professionals in developing countries and reverse the growing brain drain. Secondly, there is a need for strong advocacy on strengthening the country and continental research and development capacity. One such area is the ongoing discussions on the capacity of the continent to produce vaccines and limit dependency on donations.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo, on his part, believes that Africa\u2019s post-COVID recovery must leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). \u201cThe AfCFTA is a unique opportunity to consolidate Africa\u2019s enormously large market, which will create and recover millions of jobs, reduce Africa\u2019s import dependency, boost intra-Africa trade and exports; and strengthen intra-Africa cross-border ties and trade relations. The opportunities are simply mind-blowing, but they will involve the magic word \u2013 collaboration.\n\n\u201cRecently, Afrexim and the AfCFTA secretariat working jointly launched the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which provides a robust financial market infrastructure connecting African markets. The system enables instant cross-border payments in the respective local African currencies. This is a big boost for cross-border trade and will save African economies almost $5billion annually. Afrexim Bank as the main Settlement Agent for PAPSS provides settlement guarantees on the payment system and overdraft facilities to all settlement agents, in partnership with Africa\u2019s participating Central Banks. PAPSS will effectively eliminate Africa\u2019s financial borders, formalise and integrate Africa\u2019s payment systems, and simply make trade within Africa using local currencies easier. This is the way to go. Domestic legislation will be required as time goes on; we must anticipate and be prepared to act on these promptly.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila drew home the need for Africans to come together to advance their cause and ensure good governance. He lamented the fact that the continent has failed to advance the cause of democracy over the years as military incursion and insecurity posed threats to democracy. He said democracy on the African continent was under threat by military incursion in some Francophone countries and loss of confidence on democratic government by the people. He stressed that even in places where democratic governance is still in place; confidence in public institutions has been at its lowest ebb.\n\n\u201cAfrica has come of age. Yet there is no gainsaying that we are far from achieving the highest capability. Across the continent, democracy is under threat and in retreat. From Sudan to Mali, Guinea and Chad, elected governments have been usurped by military junta, overturning years of progress and the hopes of millions. Even in the places where elected governments are still in charge, public faith in the governing institutions is at an all-time low. When citizens lose confidence that democratic governments can meet their expectations, democracy loses credibility and support and begins a death spiral. This is the reality in too many places across our continent.\u201d\n\nHe argued that Africa\u2019s destiny is not cast in stone. \u201cour tomorrow is a consequence of today\u2019s choices; the commitments we make and the priorities we choose to pursue. Despite the real challenges and present dangers, this is also a time of abundant promise and possibility for us in Africa. Technology has remade our world into a global village where a child with a computer and internet connection in Lagos or Addis Ababa can compete in and succeed in a global marketplace that prioritises ideas and talent over religion, ethnicity and tribe.\n\n\u201cAs leaders in this new world, there is no decision more consequential than investing in Africa\u2019s young people, protecting them, ensuring their health and wellbeing and providing them with a solid education upon which to build their future.\u201d On insecurity, he said \u201cthe present insecurity and the rampaging uncertainty across the continent represent the single biggest threat to the well-being of our children.\u201d\n\nLike the Vice President, Gbajabiamila said the COVID-19 has exposed the dire conditions of our social infrastructure and brought into stark relief the massive effort required to ensure that we are better prepared for next time. He warned that \u201cthere will be a next time.\u201d He however said that despite predictions of disaster, Africa, for the most part, has managed this disease with evenness, and the actions of many governments across the continent worked to keep the worst outcomes from manifesting on our shores.\n\nBut there is a lot of work to do, he said. Much of that work will fall to parliaments across the continent. He told his colleagues that \u201cas advocates and representatives of the people, it is our responsibility to set the terms of our national development and ensure that government priorities reflect our citizens\u2019 most pressing needs and highest aspirations. We live in a time fraught with potential and danger, and every governing decision we make and every action we take has the potential to substantially remake our world for good or ill. This is, in effect, one of those defining historical moments.\u201d\n\nThe Speakers resolved that there was the need for African countries to make special provisions in their laws that will tie loans to specific projects and programmes, while taking steps to free themselves from lender nations and organisations. Africa, they said, must take appropriate steps to develop local institutions and inter-African trade enact laws that will put in place serious measures against military intervention in governance on the Africa continent. They want strong punitive measures for unconstitutional overthrow of governments on the African continent, saying \u201cAfrican parliaments must stand together to resist military coups in all parts of the continent and jointly advocate for more punitive measures, collectively as defenders of our democracies.\u201d\n\nThey want African countries to institutionalise mandatory regular reporting and publication of public debt reports, adding that there should be legislation requiring approval from the legislature on any borrowing as well as limits and properly documented plans for borrowing tied to specific projects and programmes. The Speakers also said that African parliaments must ensure proper oversight to proactively reduce Africa\u2019s debt profile while there should be greater oversight and increased budgetary allocations to ensure enhanced agricultural productivity and building of internal capacity for food production to eliminate Africa\u2019s import dependency. Also they stressed the need to develop mechanisms to increase coverage and scope of social protection to aid citizens who live in poverty, especially those affected by the recent pandemic.\n\n\u201cLegislative interventions are needed to ensure that across our continent; we cater to the needs of the poorest and weakest as well as calling for support for operationalisation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to develop competitive regional and global value chains, enhance domestic resource mobilisation, including effective public private partnership frameworks for infrastructure delivery.\u201d\n\nOn debt cancellation, the speakers insisted that debt cancellation from\n\ninternational financial institutions is required to enable African countries to invest more revenue in social protection programme; while the Conference of Speakers should press for this as a collective entity. They also called for the building of internal capacity and local industries to enable local production and processing of raw materials for export, while building resilience against external and internal shocks, eliminating dependency on external institutions, lenders and grantors.\n\nPresident of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwunmi Adesina, however, warned of an imminent food crisis, saying African countries must begin to produce their own foods and stop relying on imports from developed nations. He said many African countries rely on the importation of grains from either Ukraine or Russia, pointing out that the continent has the capacity to produce its own food.\n\n\u201cThe Russian war in Ukraine has added another challenge to what we are facing in Africa. The dependency of African countries on Russia and Ukraine, the war disruption has added to the looming food crisis in Africa. The African Development Bank has designed a $1.5 billion emergency food production plan to support African countries to avert the looming food crisis. Africa should be decoupled from food import dependency. Africa must feed itself and do so with pride. The economic recovery must be felt in the day to day lives of people. The recovery must create jobs and recover jobs lost, focus on MSMEs; the recovery must focus on youths and tackle debts of Africa. The recovery will require close partnership with the executive arm and legislative arm of government. Regardless of the challenges facing our country, be the solution providers, drive for an economic recovery that\u2019s felt by all.\u201d\n\nWhile challenging the Speakers and Heads of Parliament to help find a solution to the food and health crisis on the continent, he said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic affected the growth and development of Africa as well the rest of the world. Africa\u2019s confirmed COVID-19 cases stand at 11.5 million people with 253,000 deaths. Africa\u2019s economic growth declined by minus -1.5 percent, while over 26 million people fell further into poverty, with about 30 million jobs lost. The trajectory of economic recovery from the pandemic is shaped by access to vaccines, and on this, the divergence between developed economies and developing economies is stuck. Developed countries accounted for 63% of the people vaccinated globally, Africa our continent have only 16 percent of these people fully vaccinated which is extremely low compared to 63 percent of North America, 69 percent for Asia and so on. \u201cWe must not be complacent. The next pandemic is just around the corner. Africa must build a Healthcare Defence System. This must include development of local vaccines and building quality healthcare infrastructure.\u201d",
          "summary": "For him, a post-COVID economic recovery strategy for Africa must go beyond efforts of individual countries to forging greater collaboration and integration to drive sustainable economic growth and recovery across the African continent.\nHe said democracy on the African continent was under threat by military incursion in some Francophone countries and loss of confidence on democratic government by the people.\nPresident of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwunmi Adesina, however, warned of an imminent food crisis, saying African countries must begin to produce their own foods and stop relying on imports from developed nations.\nThe dependency of African countries on Russia and Ukraine, the war disruption has added to the looming food crisis in Africa.\nThe African Development Bank has designed a $1.5 billion emergency food production plan to support African countries to avert the looming food crisis.",

          "text": "By Precious Igbonwelundu (Lagos) and Gbenga Omokhunu, Abuja\n\nFour policemen who allegedly extorted a man, Uche Anthony, of N300,000 on Wednesday in Lagos have been arrested, spokesman Muyiwa Adejobi has said.\n\nThe policemen, according to the victim, cocked their gun and forced him to an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) along Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, Ikeja, to withdraw N280,000, which they added to the N20,000 cash he had on him and took with them.\n\nAnthony, who took to social media to lament his predicament, said his only offence was having finance technology (fintech) apps on his phone and foreign numbers in his contact.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cI just got accosted by the police and I was extorted of N300,000 in Lagos. Simply because I have Binance and Trust wallet on my phone. I use an iPhone13 pro max and I am in a lot of crypto groups and I am talking to foreign numbers who happen to be my uncles and cousins abroad.\n\n\u201cThey seized my phone and won\u2019t let me even explain. For the first time in my life someone cocked a gun at me and said I should enter the car. I\u2019m still in the trauma of the experience. I could quickly pick up the name of one of the police officers.\n\n\u201cThey insisted I must pay them more than half of what is in my account. They went to my message inbox and saw my GTB balance. I said I wasn\u2019t paying a dime and they said I\u2019ll sleep in the cell and no one will know because they were with my phone.\n\n\u201cI was so scared of my life as I have read stories of people shot dead and abandoned somewhere. They drove me about for hours and we started negotiating. They said N500,000or nothing. Omo, I started thinking that these guys might just kill me and I don\u2019t want to trend with the hashtag #justiceforuche.\n\n\u201cThey drove me to a bank in Maryland and asked me to go and withdraw cash. All the while they had my phone so I could not make any recording or take any pictures.\n\n\u201cThey took the money from me and destroyed the withdrawal receipt. They had me order a bolt driver before letting me go.\u201d\n\nAnthony\u2019s cry for help attracted the attention of the Force Police Public Relations Officer (FPPRO), CSP Muyiwa Adejobi who contacted the Lagos command and demanded investigation into the claims.\n\nA few days later, Adejobi through his Twitter handle confirmed that the police team responsible for the extortion had been identified and arrested.\n\n\u201cHe reported and we have identified them in Ikeja Area F. We have summoned them with their team leader to Abuja for proper investigation and possible sanction,\u201d he said.\n\nThe policeman caught singing and dancing to a cult song in a viral Tiktok video, Isaac Matthew, has been demoted from the rank of corporal to constable.\n\nForce spokesman CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi said in a statement yesterday that the demotion followed the outcome of an Orderly Room trial of the offender and a review of the recommended punishment for the offences of discreditable conduct, promoting secret cults as well as the violation of the social media policy of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nMatthew, who was attached to the Ebonyi State Police Command, was seen in a viral Tiktok video on May 7 dressed in full police uniform, singing, dancing, and brandishing an AK-47 rifle in praise of a secret confraternity.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe chances of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu clinching the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) narrowed yesterday, following the resolution of the National Chairman of the ruling party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, that the former governor of Lagos State will face sanctions over his utterances in Ogun State.\n\nThe APC national leader and presidential aspirant was involved in an outburst in Ogun when he visited the state to campaign to the delegates for votes ahead of the presidential primary scheduled for Monday.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAlthough Tinubu has apologised and retracted his comments in the state, the ruling party chairman hinted that the apology was not enough, insisting that he would be facing a disciplinary action.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in Abuja yesterday, specifically on the Ogun outburst, Adamu said: \u201cHe (Tinubu) went as far as saying how General Muhammadu Buhari went to him, citing instances of even prostrating in tears begging him to endorse him and to support him for the presidency. He claimed Buhari went to him.\n\n\u201cHis utterances are very, very insulting. It\u2019s very, very unbecoming for a person of that standing to do what he did to the sitting president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the president produced by the votes of the APC. Though as the president he belongs to everybody, it is amazing how a fellow APC person would make that kind of comment in that kind of circumstances about the president. We take exception to this. It has shown that he does not show any appreciable level of respect for the office of Mr. President.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we want to make it public that we are saddened by what we saw in the video, in that reportage and we condemn it in the strongest of terms. We do hope that he would never say that kind of thing again, particularly of the APC extraction to make such kinds of comments.\n\n\u201cYes, yesterday we saw some part of a retraction, but that effort is not adequate. It is not sincere. It is not indepth enough. It doesn\u2019t wipe out the impression that event has left in our minds.\u201d\n\nAsked if there will be punitive measures against him, he replied: \u201cAt the time this event took place, the screening committee has not presented their report to us at all; and was trying to suggest that anybody was under any threat. So, there was no justification for the time that this thing happened.\n\n\u201cThis morning we saw some traces of withdrawal of those statements. You see these are statements that are his intention of actual action. Yes, we can\u2019t say we refuse not seeing on the papers. It happened. He said he has the greatest respect for the president. You see in Hausa there is a proverb that once you take hold of any amount of grass from a thatched house and you pulled it off from the roof, you can\u2019t replace the same number of grass.\n\n\u201cWhat is out is out. What he did say was not an apology. It\u2019s just like trying to retract and you say I didn\u2019t mean this. It\u2019s a problem of misinterpretation. It is not a regret. If there is the need to penalize any member of the party, not just Bola Tinubu, anybody we will bring him to the party book. Anybody as we watch events as they unfold,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe former governor of Nasarawa State also spoke on the status of the statutory delegates, stressing: \u201cServe notice of appeal. Matter in court. Convention statutory delegates are excluded.\u201d\n\nOn disqualified aspirants, he said: \u201cI want to say very clearly that no aspirant has been disqualified. It\u2019s like sitting in an exam. Even if you pass there is grading from first-class to ordinary pass. So, no aspirant was disqualified. Incidentally, the president has invited all of them to a dinner today (Saturday).\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\n*Governor Badaru withdraws from race\n\n*Southern govs hail northern colleagues on zoning\n\n*Buhari urges aspirants to build consensus and come up with formidable candidate\n\n*APC may punish Tinubu over outburst against Buhari, says Adamu\n\n*Insists statutory delegates won\u2019t vote in primary\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos, Deji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nHopes for the emergence of a southerner as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been rekindled as 11 northern governors elected on the platform of the ruling party and other political leaders from the region, yesterday resolved that the presidential ticket of the party should be zoned to the South.\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari who met over dinner last night with all the 23 presidential aspirants of the party at the State House, Abuja, was said to have supported the decision of the APC northern governors to back a southern presidential aspirant.\n\n\n\nHe urged the presidential aspirants to hold consultations, build consensus and come up with formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election from June 6 to 8, 2022.\n\nIn line with the decision of the governors and other leaders, the Jigawa State Governor, Mr. Mohammed Abubakar Badaru, has withdrawn from the presidential race, just as the party\u2019s screening committee has recommended 13 presidential aspirants.\n\n\n\nBadaru\u2019s counterpart in Ebonyi State, Mr. Dave Umahi, has, however, denied stepping down from the race.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of the ruling party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu has hinted that the party may punish a frontline presidential aspirant and National Leader of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, for his recent outburst against President Buhari.\n\n\n\nHowever, in a swift response, the National Vice Chairman of the party, North-west, Dr. Salihu Lukman, said Adamu\u2019s comment on the recent outburst of Tinubu did not represent the position of the party.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday after a meeting of the northern APC governors and political leaders from the northern states, the leaders noted that they welcomed President Buhari\u2019s invitation to them and other stakeholders to contribute to the emergence of a strong presidential candidate for the party.\n\n\n\nThe statement was signed by Governors Aminu Masari (Katsina); Abubakar Sani Bello (Niger); Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa); Babagana Zulum (Borno); Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna); Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya (Gombe); Bello Matawalle (Zamfara); Simon Lalong (Plateau); Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano); Abubakar Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi) and former Governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Wamakko.\n\nKwara State Governor, Mr AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, who was not at the meeting, has also thrown his weight behind the decision of his northern colleagues, saying it was a perfect decision taken in the overall interest of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter careful deliberation, we wish to state our firm conviction that after eight years in the office of President Buhari, the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 elections should be one of our teeming members from the southern states of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a question of honour for the APC, an obligation that is not in any way affected by the decisions taken by another political party. We affirm that upholding this principle is in the interest of building a stronger, more united and more progressive country.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, wish to strongly recommend to President Buhari that the search for a successor as the APC\u2019s presidential candidate be limited to our compatriots from the southern states. We appeal to all aspirants from the northern states to withdraw in the national interest and allow only the aspirants from the south to proceed to the primaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are delighted by the decision of our esteemed colleague, His Excellency, Governor Abubakar Badaru to contribute to this patriotic quest by withdrawing his presidential aspiration,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe northern governors argued that the ruling party has to ensure that the 2023 elections offer a nation-building moment, reaffirming that a democratic pathway to power exists for all who value cooperation and build national platforms.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis moment calls for the most sober and inclusive approach to selecting our party\u2019s candidate, and we call on all APC leaders to fulfil their responsibility in this regard,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAPC May Punish Tinubu over Outburst against Buhari, Says Adamu\n\nThe National Chairman of the APC, Adamu has hinted that the party may punish a frontline presidential aspirant, Tinubu, for his recent outburst against President Buhari.\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja yesterday, Adamu described Tinubu\u2019s utterances as insulting, unbecoming, and a mark of lack of respect for the president\n\n\n\nAdamu stated categorically that the party would henceforth be on the lookout to punish Tinubu or any other aspirant that makes a similar statement as the event unfolds.\n\n\n\nTinubu had while addressing delegates in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said he made Buhari president in 2015.\n\nThough the former Lagos State governor had in a statement issued on Friday clarified that he has the utmost respect for President Buhari, the APC National Chairman insisted that what the presidential hopeful did was not an apology, but a retraction of his statement.\n\n\n\nAdamu argued that Tinubu\u2019s utterances did not wipe out the impression that his comments had created in people\u2019s minds.\n\n\n\nHis words: \u201cWithin the last three days, the country, and the world of the social media have been undaunted by the report of one of our leaders, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, former Governor of Lagos State when he went for his campaign in Ogun \u2013Abeokuta. In the course of his address, he went as far as to mention what happened between him and President Muhamadu Buhari.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe went as far as to tell his audience how President Buhari went to him; even prostrating in tears, begging him to endorse him for the presidency. He claimed that Buhari went to him. The words in Yoruba\u2026 the interpretation was very insulting, very unbecoming of a person of that standing to do what he did to a sitting president produced by the votes of APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is amazing how a fellow APC person can make that kind of comment about the president. We take exception to this and this doesn\u2019t show any appreciable level of respect for the office of Mr. President and the person of Mr. President.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, we want to make it public that we are saddened about the audio and video in that reportage and we condemn it in the strongest terms. We do hope he will never say that kind of thing again \u2013 especially those of APC extraction to make that kind of unbecoming comments.\n\n\n\n\u201cBetween yesterday and this morning, it was retracted but that effort is not adequate. It doesn\u2019t wipe out the impression that event has left in our minds. This is our position. I, as chairman of the ruling party, have the duty to come out and stand by our government, to stand by our president,\u201d Adamu explained.\n\n\n\nAsked if punitive measures would be taken against Tinubu, the APC national chairman said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to take this together because they are mischief-laden. I don\u2019t want to take the primary screening to answer this question because doing so is finding a way to justify, and give some reasons that may have caused what he did. For one thing, I know at the time this event took place the screening committee had not made the report to us at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe question of punitive measures is yes and no! This morning we saw some traces of withdrawal statements. You see, these are statements that can emerge not with the intention of the actual actions. So yes, we can\u2019t say we don\u2019t see in the papers what was reported. It happened. What is out is out. It is not an apology, it is trying to retract. We will be on the watch for us to penalise any member of the party not just Bola Tinubu, anybody. We will watch events as they unfold,\u201d Adamu added.\n\n\n\nHowever, in a swift reaction, the National Vice Chairman of APC, North-west, Lukman has said that Adamu\u2019s comment did not represent the position of the party.\n\nIn a telephone interview with journalists, Lukman said while Tinubu, as well as other members of the party had acknowledged that the statement was unfortunate, it could not be used against him until the appropriate organ of the party deliberates and takes a decision on it.\n\n\n\nThe party chieftain said Adamu\u2019s position at the moment remained his personal opinion and did not represent the decision of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe all, including Asiwaju himself, acknowledged that it was unfortunate he made those statements and it is his right to express his frustration, it should be recognised as such.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut nobody, no matter the position of the person, can use it against him unless the party follows the due process through the rightful organs of the party to discuss it.\n\n\u201cSo, the opinion expressed by Abdullahi Adamu was his personal opinion and it is his right to present it to any organ of the party for consideration.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut until that opinion is adopted by the organ of the party, it cannot be considered as the position of the party. It is not the position of APC, it is his personal opinion,\u201d Lukman added.\n\nIn a related development, Adamu has stated categorically that statutory delegates are excluded from the special convention of the party, adding that the party has already served an appeal for the judgment given by a Federal High Court in Kano.\n\n\n\nA Federal High Court in Kano had on Friday ruled that Section 84 of the Electoral Act did not prevent statutory delegates from voting.\n\nReacting to the judgment, Adamu noted: \u201cWell, I am a lawyer, we have served notice of appeal and matter is in the court and as far as we are concerned, this convention is concerned, statutory delegates are excluded.\u201d\n\nAPC Screening Panel Recommends 13 Aspirants\n\nIn a related development, the John Odigie-Oyegun panel that screened the party\u2019s 23 presidential aspirants has recommended 13 aspirants to the party. The recommended aspirants include Governor Badaru of Kebbi State; Senator Godswill Akpabio; Mr Chibuike Amaechi; Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Mr Yahaya Bello; Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi; Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Senator Bola Tinubu; Mr Tein Jack-Rich; Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba; Dr Christopher Onu and Ebonyi State Governor, Mr Dave Umahi.\n\nThe National Chairman of the party, Adamu, has however, clarified that no presidential aspirant has been disqualified.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to say very clearly that no aspirant has been disqualified. Interestingly, President Muhamadu Buhari has invited them to the villa for dinner today (yesterday). He will be interacting with all of them today,\u201d Adamu told journalists in Abuja.\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary, the Ondo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has promised that the APC will have a hitch-free event on Monday.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu said this in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Richard Olatunde in Akure.\n\nThe governor, who is the Chairman of, Sub-committee on Security and Compliance for the APC Special Convention and Presidential Primary Election, said that the party was ready for the election.\n\nBuhari Urges Aspirants to Come up With Formidable Candidate\n\nAt last night\u2019s meeting with all the 23 APC aspirants, President Buhari urged them to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election from June 6 to 8, 2022.\n\nThe president, according to a statement issued last night by his Media Adviser, Mr Femi Adesina, said the meeting was a continuation of the ongoing consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard-bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\n\nThe president added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe 2023 elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognising the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe president recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the state governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. \u201cThese steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmongst other things, I reminded the APC governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognise the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasised.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\n\n\u201cAhead of the convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognising this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, to build a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe president assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and ongoing consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully choose the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all-important responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, in his speech, the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\n\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of the old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovations, Dr, Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the president for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counselled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d\n\nSouthern govs hail northern colleagues on zoning\n\nMeanwhile, the Southern Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum has hailed their northern counterparts on the decision to zone the APC presidential ticket to the South.\n\nIn a statement issued last night, the Chairman of the forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, said the southern governors did not expect anything short of the heart-warming decision from their northern colleagues whom he described as great patriots and reliable partners in the collaborative efforts geared towards the attainment of nationhood for the country.\n\n\u201cThis is indeed another landmark achievement in our quest for understanding, rapprochement and continual engagements for mutual beneficence.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge this courageous stance for equity and moral rectitude. We applaud the zeal and determination of our brothers to engage realistically and honestly. We salute this uncommon resolve to confront issues militating against the march towards nationhood and ultimate greatness. By this gesture, we are convinced of the seriousness of our colleagues to join other patriots in ensuring that the ascendant march towards stability, progress and prosperity is not truncated by indiscretion,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe southern governors lauded Jigawa Governor, Badaru, for his exemplary conduct, stressing that posterity will remember him for good.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe thank the leadership of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum for the patriotic zest displayed at this crucial moment. We look forward to conducting a hitch-free convention which will culminate in the election of a suitable candidate who will hoist the flag of the party with a sense of mission,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "SIMONKOLAWOLELIVE!\n\nIf power does not go to the south in 2023, the pivotal role of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar will have to be scrutinised. His life ambition is to be president of Nigeria and his influence on the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) effectively ensured that the main opposition party did not zone presidency to the south. With Rt Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto state, dropping out at the last minute and handing over his votes to Atiku, a fellow northerner, there was going to be only one outcome. Atiku secured 371 delegate votes, outscoring Governor Nyesom Wike who got 237. The margin of 134 is attributed to the Tambuwal effect, to the chagrin of many southerners.\n\nDr Iyorchia Ayu, the PDP chairman and Atiku\u2019s long-time associate, was caught on video celebrating Tambuwal as a \u201chero\u201d. The immediate implication is that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will now have to take a decision: to zone its ticket to the north to counter Atiku or zone to the south for the sake of national sensitives. The easiest way to achieve rotation was for the two leading parties to zone to the south. Head or tail, presidential power would have gone to the south. However, the choice of Atiku as PDP\u2019s flagbearer will test APC\u2019s fidelity to the political understanding on rotation. Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the APC chairman, has been telling us there is no decision yet on zoning.\n\nTo refresh our memories, next year will mark the 30th anniversary of Atiku\u2019s presidential ambition. His first attempt was in 1993 under the now-defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP). With the Option A4 experiment performed by the electoral commission, there were four stages to become a presidential candidate. Hence the name: Option A4. The first was at ward level, the second at local government, the third at state and the fourth at national. Every state had a presidential flagbearer, and since Nigeria had 30 states then, there were 30 contestants in each of the two parties. The SDP presidential convention was held at the Jos Township Stadium, Plateau state, on March 27-29.\n\nAtiku was the SDP candidate from Adamawa, Bashorun MKO Abiola from Ogun and Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, former SDP chairman, from Borno. These were the top contenders. Kingibe had most of the SDP governors on his side, Atiku had Maj-Gen Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adia (rtd) and his political machinery, while Abiola had name recognition and widespread goodwill. At the end of the first round of voting in which delegates had to pick three contestants in order of preference, Abiola came tops with 3,617 votes, Kingibe second with 3,225 and Atiku third with 2,066. There was no clear majority. That meant there was going to be a run-off where delegates were limited to picking only one choice.\n\nAbiola went into intense negotiations with Yar\u2019Adua/Atiku, reportedly promising to make Atiku his running mate if they jointly fended off Kingibe. With deal sealed, Atiku informed his supporters just before the second round of voting that he was quitting the race. \u201cDistinguished national delegates, I very much appreciate your endorsement last night\u2026 But in order to ensure a rancour-free election tonight, I beg and I plead with you to allow me to discontinue the race,\u201d he said. Abiola polled 2,683 votes to Kingibe\u2019s 2,456 and was crowned the presidential candidate. He ended up picking Kingibe, and not Atiku, as his running mate and went on to win the June 12, 1993 poll. It was sadly annulled.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku kept nurturing his ambition. After winning the 1999 governorship in Adamawa on the platform of the PDP, he was picked as VP candidate by President Olusegun Obasanjo. But since he had his eyes on the presidency, he set up campaign structures ahead of 2003 \u2014 despite Obasanjo being eligible for second term. He said he had three options: to support Obasanjo, to go with Dr Alex Ekwueme, and to contest himself. He later pulled back but Obasanjo still blocked him in the PDP in 2007. He defected to the Action Congress (AC), ran for president and came third behind Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (PDP), sibling of his mentor, and Maj-Gen Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP).\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua terminally ill, Atiku returned to the PDP to pursue his ambition, insisting that it was the north\u2019s turn after the south had done eight years through Obasanjo. President Goodluck Jonathan, a southerner who became president after Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death in May 2010, also wanted to run in 2011 and disingenuously denied the existence of power rotation in the PDP. Atiku rallied the north to produce a \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d to face Jonathan at the primary, with Gen Ibrahim Babangida, Dr Bukola Saraki and Gen Aliyu Gusau all showing interest. The Northern Political Leaders Forum (NPLF), led by Mallam Adamu Ciroma, picked Atiku but he still lost the ticket to Jonathan.\n\nIn a sense, the bitterness over power rotation in 2011, not ameliorated in any way by Atiku\u2019s bid to get PDP\u2019s ticket, gravely poisoned the geo-political atmosphere and I am of the opinion that we are still suffering from the consequences. Jonathan went ahead to win the presidential election in 2011, claiming 16 out of the 17 southern states and seven of the 19 northern states. Some key northern politicians supported him, allegedly with the pact that he would do only one term. Atiku stayed behind until it became clear Jonathan would run again in 2015. He walked out on the party, teamed up with the newly formed APC \u2014 an amalgam of four opposition parties \u2014 to help crush PDP.\n\nAtiku re-launched his presidential quest in APC, but he could only come third in the primary as Buhari got the ticket with 3,430 votes. Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso came second with 974 votes, while the former vice-president scored 954. In 2017, with the message quite clear that Buhari would seek a second term, Atiku returned to PDP yet again to continue the pursuit of his life ambition of being president. He was promoted as the best northerner to tackle Buhari in the 2019 presidential poll and he did not do his chances any harm by winning PDP\u2019s primary, getting 1,532 delegate votes and pushing Tambuwal, who was heavily backed by Wike, to a very distant second with 693 votes.\n\nHaving lost the election to Buhari in 2019, Atiku was assumed to have ended his Aso Rock pursuit. It was expected that with Buhari in power from 2015 to 2023, it was only logical for PDP and APC to pick candidates from the south next. But Atiku would have none of it. He came back on the scene and has now won the PDP ticket, in the process kicking against the power rotation he had vehemently stood for in 2011. \u201cThe PDP, of which I am a founding member, should focus on winning, not on zoning,\u201d he said in an interview. I recall arguing in 2010 that Atiku was only interested in actualising his lifelong ambition and not particularly keen on the rotation policy.\n\nBy now spitting on power rotation, Atiku has somehow vindicated my perception of him: that all he wants is power. He has participated in every presidential primary since 2007 \u2014 zoning or no zoning. The Atiku I know is not an ethnic champion or bigot, contrary to the impression he created in 2011 when he wanted the PDP ticket by any means necessary, even dangerously invoking John F. Kennedy\u2019s quote about \u201cthose who make peaceful change impossible make violent change inevitable\u201d. I testify that he is a broadminded Nigerian with friends and associates across every tribe and tongue, but he was so desperate for the ticket in 2011 he gleefully played the regional game.\n\nFinally, I want to be clear: I believe Atiku has every right to contest and has not broken any law by doing so. I also believe he is competent and has the experience to lead the country. However, he has proved not to be much of a statesman. His life-long ambition has the potential to upset Nigeria\u2019s fragile balance at a time there is so much discontent with the union. Moreover, there are equally competent and experienced southerners. Our nationhood is constantly under threat because of our fault lines and sensitivities. I worry deeply that we are threading this divisive path yet again. If he wins the presidential election, power could be in the north for 12, or even 16, years non-stop.\n\nIt is particularly worrisome because of the inevitable scenarios. Whatever the APC does at its presidential convention this week will come with challenges. One, if the ruling party goes ahead to field a southerner, our troubling fault lines may be magnified. It may be cast as North vs South, as we saw in previous elections in parts of the country with the attendant consequences that we are still having to live with. I am one of those who believe that regional tensions are a major distraction to Nigeria\u2019s development as sectional groups and ethnic champions continue to heat up the polity and make parts of the country ungovernable just to score a point. We can\u2019t progress like this.\n\nTwo, if the APC decides to go north so as to snuff out any potential advantage that fielding Atiku can confer on the PDP, that would even be more problematic. We are going to be left having to pick between six and half a dozen, or between and betwixt. The majority of southerners may be left with a feeling of being edged out of the game, and this can only further widen and deepen our fault lines and create a hostile polity for several years to come. It is glaring that there will always be consequences either direction APC faces: north or south. Unfortunately, when the deed has been done, it is the rest of us, who are neither APC nor PDP, that will have to live with the consequences.\n\nThere is a third scenario: if APC/PDP decide to field northerners, the possibility of a third force \u2014 which will unfortunately further divide us along regional lines \u2014 may be stronger than ever. A possible southern solidary forged with some northern states may upset the APC/PDP duopoly and redraw our electoral map. I am not saying it is a certainty, but we have eight months to the elections and there is enough time for planning, realignment and mobilisation of forces. There will be unpalatable dynamics as regional tensions will become well pronounced again. All these scenarios because the PDP, in a bid to help the northern aspirants, did not do the rational thing on zoning.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nTINUBU\u2019S OUTBURST\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu broke the internet on Thursday and Friday following his series of outbursts in Abeokuta, Ogun state, while addressing delegates to the APC presidential convention. The former governor of Lagos state, who is seeking his party\u2019s presidential ticket, outlined how he has been betrayed by the people he toiled for day and night to help get into positions of power. While I cannot judge him for feeling the way he does (I think every human being will feel bitter about betrayals), I am amazed that he said all that in a public place, on camera and at a time no candidate had been openly endorsed by President Buhari. I think Tinubu needs to be calming down. Tact.\n\nUNIFORMED KIDNAPPERS?\n\nSamuel Kanu Uche, the head of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), is arguably the most prominent victim of kidnap-for-ransom in recent times. He was abducted by gunmen along the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state on Sunday. He said it took a N100 million ransom to get him and two other clerics freed. He made serious allegations against soldiers whom he said were involved in the dastardly crime. Although I flinched when he described them as \u201cFulani and non-Christians\u201d because it sounds like the profiling that has become the order of the day, the military authorities will do Nigerians a world of good by investigating this diligently. Creepy.\n\nDREAM KILLERS\n\nYou can never make up some things about this our country. D\u2019Tigress, our enterprising and inspirational female basketball team, fought tooth and nail to qualify for the 2022 International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia. We were still clinking glasses to celebrate the feat when the Nigerian government announced that we were withdrawing from international basketball for two years \u201cto revamp the sport from the grassroots\u201d. There is apparently a power tussle in the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) and the best way to resolve it is to slice off our nose to spite our face. We are killing the spirit of these athletes. What a country. Senseless.\n\nAND FINALLY\u2026\n\nMr Tanko Sabo, from Kaduna state, became an instant sensation on Wednesday when he disclosed that he had reinvested the money he made as a delegate in the welfare of his people. He did not reveal exactly how much he made but said he paid N6.9 million as WAEC and NECO fees for 150 orphans and the underprivileged, spent N3.2 million to buy 42 customised football jerseys for youths in his community, and another N350,000 to support elders, women and \u201cexecutive beggars\u201d. The economics of electioneering can be seen in the trickle-down effect in Sabo\u2019s case. It is like wealth redistribution, although we would be overstretching things by saying he is Robin Hood. Amusing.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Dr Iyorchia Ayu, the PDP chairman and Atiku\u2019s long-time associate, was caught on video celebrating Tambuwal as a \u201chero\u201d.\nHead or tail, presidential power would have gone to the south.\nThe first was at ward level, the second at local government, the third at state and the fourth at national.\nBy now spitting on power rotation, Atiku has somehow vindicated my perception of him: that all he wants is power.\nHis life-long ambition has the potential to upset Nigeria\u2019s fragile balance at a time there is so much discontent with the union.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Four rising sectors in African tech",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem had its best year ever in 2021 when it raised $5.2 billion (per Partech data), and it was predicted by investment tracking platform, Africa: The Big Deal, that the continent is on its way to raising $7 billion in 2022. It is not a surprise that fintech dominated last year\u2019s total funding, accounting for 63% or $3 billion of the funding that went to African startups. This year, so far, African startups have raised $2.1 billion, according to data from TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker, with fintech still leading the way with $660 million.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t look like fintech\u2019s dominance will wane anytime soon in Africa, there are other sectors on the continent getting significant funding, and you should be paying attention to them.\n\n1. AI\n\nBefore this year, African startups struggled to be involved in the AI conversation. In 2020, when AI companies globally attracted $36 billion, AI companies on the continent could only raise $11.63 million. There were concerns that Africa would be left behind in the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to this slow pace in catching up with AI development, which threatens the future of Africans in an increasingly digital world. But one startup was all it took to bring Africa\u2019s AI industry to prominence. InstaDeep.\n\nCompany to watch: InstaDeep\n\nFounded in 2014 in the Tunisian city of Tataouine, InstaDeep\u2019s decision-making AI design allows it to boost productivity across a wide range of companies and industries. In the global AI race, dominated by the US and China, InstaDeep is the only African startup involved in shaping the evolution of the technology.\n\nIn January, it raised $100 million\u2014the only record funding into the African AI industry this year\u2014solidifying hopes that Africa can play on the global AI scene. It is being primed to take on massive projects such as creating an early-warning system for COVID-19 and a predictive railway timing system.\n\n2. Edtech\n\nAfter the pandemic disrupted education, the world turned to edtech solutions to continue learning in an efficient and effective way. While many edtech companies around the world benefited from this, as the industry attracted an influx of funding, African edtech companies struggled to tap into this opportunity. In 2021, when edtech globally raised $20 billion, African edtech companies raised less than $40 million. But Africa has an education crisis, which sees over 100 million children out of school across different educational levels on the continent. While there isn\u2019t a funding boom yet in edtech in Africa, there is a huge market here. There have been impressive efforts by African companies to solve the continent\u2019s educational problems.\n\nCompany to watch: Ulesson and FoondaMate\n\nUlesson\n\nNigerian startup, Ulesson was Africa\u2019s most funded edtech platform last year, raising $22.5 million across 2 funding rounds. Ulesson\u2019s work can be seen as pioneering for the edtech space; it brought Tencent and Owl Ventures, some of the world\u2019s biggest edtech investors, to the continent through its funding rounds.\n\nFoondaMate\n\nSouth African startup, FoondaMate teaches high school students using a WhatsApp bot that looks like 2 friends chit-chatting. Last month, FoondaMate raised $2 million to expand its unorthodox solution to more high school students in the country. WhatsApp is the most popular social media app in Africa, with 192 million users, as of 2018. In Foondamate\u2019s country of primary operation, South Africa, 95% of South Africans say they use their WhatsApp every month. FoondaMate told TechCabal that it has helped over 400,000 students cutting across more than 10 languages from over 30 countries, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia, targets 50 million users in the next few years and is willing to expand to achieve that.\n\n3. Cleantech\n\nSeventy-five percent of the world\u2019s population without access to electricity and renewable energy sources reside in Africa. Increased funding in clean energy by investors will help Africa fill this deficit. This has also made cleantech the closest industry to upsetting fintech this year, if the current momentum is maintained. The biggest funding ticket on the continent so far went to a cleantech company, making it the second most funded industry so far, this year.\n\nCompany to watch: Sun King\n\nSolar company, Sun King, raised $260 million in a Series D round to expand access to off-grid power to customers in Africa and Asia. It reported that it reached 18 million people in a decade of operations in Kenya, and is tripling its customers in Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania. Sun King said it will use $100 million to expand its pay-as-you-go solution and allow users to power bigger home appliances in the markets it operates in.\n\n4. Agritech\n\nAfrica is facing its worst food crisis in 10 years, with 27 million people experiencing extreme hunger in Nigeria, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya; and there are fears that 11 million more could become hungry in 3 months if nothing is done. This food crisis is exacerbated by the high cost of food, recurring droughts, conflicts on the continent, and the Ukraine-Russia war. More than ever Africa needs to be food-sufficient because, for the most part, it has had to rely on humanitarian efforts to feed its citizens. So far, this year, African agritech companies have raised $115 million per TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker.\n\nCompany to watch: ThriveAgric\n\nFounded in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers through financing received from crowdfunders. Then it joined Y Combinator and other notable accelerators, and it looked like it was going to be a happily-ever-after story. But things got bad in 2020 when it couldn\u2019t pay back its crowdfunders; apparently, the pandemic had affected its business model. It survived the turbulence through resilience, a characteristic that is admirable in solving hard problems, especially in Africa, and bounced back when it raised $56.4 million in debt financing to expand to Zambia, Kenya, and Ghana. Since ThriveAgric didn\u2019t go away in 2020, it seems it never will\u2014at least not without putting up a fight.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday, continued his engagements with the All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders, at a dinner, as he makes last minute efforts to achieve a consensus for the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nThe dinner which took place at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Sunday, came on the heels of a similar one on Saturday night.\n\nThe President in his welcome speech, consultative meeting Sunday, Buhari stated that the party will explore its rich Human Resources to produce the best candidate at the convention starting tomorrow\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future.\u201d\n\nHe added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nHe recalled how the party had recorded two successive presidential election victories, both in 2015 and when he contested in 2019.\n\n\u201cBoth processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nThe President who noted that there were anxieties ahead of the Monday June 6, 2022 national convention, added that \u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\u201cAhead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\nBuhari mourns Owo Catholic Church shooting victims\n\nRead also:\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nAmongst those at the dinner were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila and other prominent members of the ruling party.",

          "text": "There was pandemonium on Sunday in Owo, Owo Local Government Area of Ondo state as some gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa, killing scores of worshipers.\n\nOur correspondent who visited the scene of the incident learnt that the bomb attack allegedly carried out by some unknown gunmen, which occurred on the church premises behind Olowo of Owo palace, left many dead and many others injured.\n\nIt was observed that these gunmen used dynamites to blow the altar of the Church while the service was going on.\n\nAn eyewitness, Kehinde Ogunkorode, who spoke with journalists said the incident had caused pandemonium in the area as no fewer than 50 persons were killed by the gunmen\n\nAccording to him, while some residents, who escaped being killed ran for their safety.\n\nBlood stains litter the floor of the Church as corpses were moved to the Federal Medical Centre and St Louis Catholic Hospital, Owo.\n\nMany who were injured in the incident have also been rushed to the hospital.\n\nIt was however gathered that some security men who later came to the scene of the incident were chased away immediately by the angry people.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Funmilayo Odunlami, who also confirmed the attack said the Commissioner of Police, Oyeyemi Oyediran has deployed men of the Explosives Ordinance Device unit aka Anti Bomb Squad to the scene while all efforts is being intensified to arrest those who perpetrated the evil.\n\nOdunlami, however, implored the people of the state to be calm as all security apparatus is currently active to ensure peace in Owo.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has said he is deeply saddened by the unprovoked attack and killing of innocent people of Owo, worshiping at the St Francis Catholic Church, Owa-luwa Street, on Sunday.\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement made available to journalists by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, however, disclosed that the government shall commit every available resource to hunt down these assailants and make them pay.\n\nThe statement reads further, \u201cthe vile and satanic attack is a calculated assault on the peace-loving people of Owo Kingdom who have enjoyed relative peace over the years.\n\n\u201cIt is a black Sunday in Owo. Our hearts are heavy. Our peace and tranquility have been attacked by the enemies of the people. This is a personal loss, an attack on our dear state.\n\n\u201cI have spoken to the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo, Most Reverend Jude Arogundade, who is presently on his way to Owo. Similarly, I have had to cut short my party\u2019s national assignment in Abuja and visit Owo immediately.\n\n\u201cThis is an unexpected development. I am shocked to say the least. Nevertheless, We shall commit every available resource to hunt down these assailants and make them pay. We shall never bow to the machinations of heartless elements in our resolves to rid our state of criminals.\n\n\u201cI commiserate with my people in Owo, particularly families of the those who lost their lives to this ugly and unfortunate attack. I extend my condolences to Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye as well as the Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cI urge our people to remain calm and vigilant. Do not take laws into your hands. I have spoken to the heads of the security agencies. I have equally been assured that security operatives would be deployed to monitor and restore normalcy to Owo kingdom.\u201d\n\nWhile the Pan-Yoruba Socio-political Organisation, Afenifere, has said that the incident\n\nwas a direct attack on the Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, as well as Yoruba land.\n\nThe Organising Secretary of the organization, Kole Omololu, in a statement also made available to journalists in Akure, however, condemned the attack.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe massacre in Owo Catholic Church is a direct attack on Yoruba land.\n\n\u201cIt is directed at Governor Rotimi Akeredolu for his unflinching support for security in Yoruba land by championing the Amotekun security outfits, his stringent upholding of the open grazing law, and for his \u2018big mouth\u2019 about Southern co-operation for equity and justice in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe will not succumb into terrorist threats or attack.\n\n\u201cThey will not be allowed to bring down our civilisation. We will hunt the killers down. Citizens should not take law into their own hands by attacking innocent northerners. Only the terrorists, who are mostly foreign Fulani, should be fished out and finish off by the security forces.\n\n\u201cThis attack is to cause confusion and cause war in our land. We should not play into their hands. This evil is condemned in the strongest term.\n\n\u201cWe commiserate with the government and people of Ondo state, the Catholic Church, the Olowo of Owo and the people of Owo.

          "text": "The Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu Campaign Organisation has described the 11 Northern All Progressives Congress Governors as worthy patriots for their decision to support power shift to the South.\n\nThe campaign organisation in a press statement on Sunday, signed by its Director of Media and Communication, Bayo Onanuga noted that all lovers of peace, progress, equity, justice and stability of Nigeria should celebrate and honour the Northern APC Governors.\n\nRead also: APC to sanction Tinubu over utterances against Buhari in Abeokuta\n\nThe 11 Governors of APC from the North in a press statement endorsed by them on Saturday announced that they took a decision to support the next President of Nigeria from the South after the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari in the best interest of the country. The Northern APC Governors also commended their Jigawa State counterpart, Governor Mohammad Abubakar Badaru for withdrawing from the presidential race ahead of APC Convention on Tuesday, June 7, 2022.\n\nIn a reaction to the development, Mr. Onanuga expressed the satisfaction of Tinubu Campaign Organisation with the decision of the APC Governors whom he said put national interest above regional interest, stressing that the decision of the Governors removed all the anxieties, uncertainties and conspiracy theories hovering around the party\u2019s presidential nomination process.\n\nThe campaign also commended Governor Abubakar Badaru for promptly complying with the position of the region. We enjoin other aspirants such as the Senate President Ahmad Lawan, Governor Yahaya Bello and former Governor Ahmed Rufai Sani Yerima to also bow out of the race. History will be kind to them all.\n\nOnanuga noted that the APC can now go into its national convention which will be open to only presidential aspirants from the South to seek the mandate of party members through their elected delegates without acrimony and suspicions.\n\n\u201cWe salute the courage of the APC Governors from the North for their patriotic decision to sustain the unity of the country and that of the party. The decision of the Northern APC Governors has once again confirmed that our country will make tremendous progress when the bond of our unity is strengthened and preserved.\n\n\u201c Our APC Northern governors have shown that the APC believes in power rotation in the true spirit of national equity and justice, unlike the opposition Peoples Democratic Party that abandoned its zoning policy for hegemonic political expediency, ethnic and religious calculations, that grossly undermined the party\u2019s commitment to the 1999 constitution.\n\n\u201c Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu believes that our country does better when leaders across the country rise above personal, ethnic and religious sentiments to uphold justice and fairness. The 11 Northern APC Governors have restored the confidence of millions of Nigerians and party members in the greatness and unity of our country.\n\n\u201cThese Governors are patriots and honourable men who will be remembered for acting to save Nigeria from potential political crisis and another round of national distrust and mistrust.\n\n\u201cWith this decision, the future of APC as the governing party in Nigeria is very bright as a true national party. The party can now proceed to hold the Convention as a united, strong and viable political platform by electing a capable presidential flag bearer in whom the Nigerian people can invest their trust by supporting him to win the general election.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the delegates will make the right choice by giving Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu the honour of flying the flag of APC as our presidential candidate in line with the expectation of President Muhammadu Buhari that the candidate of our party must be one who can win election, who is acceptable to all Nigerians and one who can give Nigerians a sense of confidence and victory.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu is the most prepared and capable of all the aspirants. He has shown this with his track record in Lagos. He has comprehensive development plan that will build on the success of the Buhari-led administration and create greater prosperity for Nigerians,\u201d Onanuga said in the statement.",

During our discussions, we welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s invitation to governors and other stakeholders to contribute to the emergence of a strong presidential candidate for the APC.\n\n\u201cAfter careful deliberation, we wish to state our firm conviction that after eight years in office of President Muhammadu Buhari, the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 elections should be one of our teeming members from the southern states of Nigeria. It is a question of honour for the APC, an obligation that is not in anyway affected by the decisions taken by another political party. We affirm that upholding this principle is in the interest of building a stronger, more united and more progressive country.\n\n\u201cWe therefore wish to strongly recommend to President Muhammadu Buhari that the search for a successor as the APC\u2019s presidential candidate be limited to our compatriots from the southern states. We appeal to all aspirants from the northern states to withdraw in the national interest and allow only the aspirants from the south to proceed to the primaries. We are delighted by the decision of our esteemed colleague, His Excellency, Governor Abubakar Badaru to contribute to this patriotic quest by withdrawing his presidential aspiration.\n\n\u201cThe APC has a duty to ensure that the 2023 elections offer a nation-building moment, reaffirming that a democratic pathway to power exists for all who value cooperation and build national platforms.

His own fellow brothers in Afenifere who openly don\u2019t like him and also the APC governors who don\u2019t like him because they say he is too domineering and a dictator. I mean, he is their own son, why can\u2019t they make him?\u201d\n\n\u201cMark my words, Buhari will never ever support Tinubu. I know the man\u2019s mentality and psychology. He will never ever support Tinubu. I said it but people didn\u2019t believe me but wait and see. The whole thing is not about Tinubu or about any other interest. It is not even about the bigger picture called Nigeria but other interests. There is no way Buhari is going to support Tinubu, because the whole thing is going to take personal dimension.\n\n\u201cLet us be honest, Tinubu today is swimming alone. Look at the phenomenon he was but they are now saying no to him.\n\n\u201cIf the South is ready to win this election, the only candidate that can give the PDP a fight for their money is Tinubu.

The world is moving towards an online world which means that data is going to be given and stored somewhere and it can be compromised. That is core purpose of your agency, to ensure that the data is properly used to the benefit of Nigeria and Nigerians, and I believe that this is an important task.\n\nLooking at the capital market, people buy investments, remove money, get dividends etc., everything about it is data because no one wants to go to a stockbroker\u2019s office now.\n\nWe will give you the maximum support that we can.

The sector had the highest contribution to our GDP last year and that speaks volumes. Over 104 million Nigerians go on the internet daily and now we are looking at digitizing everything.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring the protection of the data of Nigerians and to ensure we have globally competitive businesses as most countries will not want to go into business with you if you do not have your data protection and a supervising authority in place.",

You upskilled 30 kids in Lagos juvenile homes on ICT skills and advocated policy reforms in juvenile administration. You trained school counselors on addressing mental health challenges in public schools.\n\n\u201cYou taught rural women basic recycling skills and trained public school teachers on the use of modern teaching methods and aids. The projects implemented by the 2021 CYFI cohort are truly inspiring. These are meaningful, impactful projects. You have laid solid foundations for future work and I look forward to seeing where these initiatives go from here,\u201d Ibelli added.\n\nIbelli welcomed the graduating CYFI fellows to the U.S. government exchange alumni community, a prestigious and vast network of like-minded and highly regarded professionals across the country. \u201cI encourage you to take advantage of the exchange alumni group to continue to grow and support each other,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a goodwill message delivered at the event, wife of late Ambassador Carrington, Dr. Arese Carrington, congratulated the 2021 cohort and urged them to remain exemplars of honesty and concern for the welfare of the less privileged.\n\n\u201cThe innovative projects you designed and carried out during the past year have impacted lives positively. Never stop dreaming or daring to effect the needed change because you are the hope for the future,\u201d Dr. Arese Carrington added.\n\nCYFI is built around year-long social innovation projects that are designed by fellows and supported by the U.S. Consulate and private partners. The 2021 cohort is the first graduating class since the passing of Ambassador Carrington.\n\nTo date, CYFI has graduated 174 outstanding young Nigerians who bring a wealth of knowledge and skills to the table, and share a common vision with the goal of positively impacting the Nigerian society.\n\nMotivated and self-driven young Nigerians interested in becoming a CYFI fellow can apply by filling out the application form at: http://www.cyfinigeria.org/apply/",

          "text": "Rafael Nadal won his 14th French Open title after producing a ruthless 6-3 6-3 6-0 win over Casper Ruud on Sunday afternoon.\n\nNadal now has 22 Grand Slam singles titles which puts him two clear of his great tennis rivals Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in the men\u2019s all-time race.\n\nIt is also the first time Nadal has won the Australian Open and the French Open in the same year.\n\nNadal received an ovation he will likely never forget as he walked out onto Court Philippe-Chatrier, with talk of him potentially retiring swirling due to his prolonged injury struggles, but he showed no signs of discomfort during his dominant victory in two hours and 18 minutes.\n\nNadal suggested in his winners speech afterwards that he will not leave the sport just yet and instead \u201ckeep fighting\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s very difficult to describe the feelings that I have,\u201d the 36-year-old said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I never believed to be here at 36; being competitive again, playing on the most important court of my career. It means [an awful] lot to me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen in the future, but I\u2019m going to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nRuud said: \u201cWe know what a champion you are, and today, I got to experience playing against you in a final. It\u2019s not easy, and I\u2019m not the first victim. There have been many before!\n\n\u201cYou are a true inspiration. [Not just] for me, for anyone who follows tennis around the world, We all hope that you continue for [longer].\u201d\n\nThe Nadal Academy trainee Ruud, playing in his first French Open final, got off to a nightmare start against the Spaniard that he considers his childhood idol.Nadal\u2019s Norwegian apprentice was broken in just the second game of the match.\n\nNadal clinched the advantage thanks to a wonderful cross-court winner off his forehand.But Nadal followed up with arguably one of his worst ever service games at Roland-Garros.\n\nNadal\u2019s two successive double faults handed Ruud two break points and he converted the second one when the 34-year-old hit a tame forehand unforced error into the net.\n\nA flurry of unforced errors from Ruud in the next game earned Nadal another break point and he moved into a 3-1 lead when the Norwegian\u2019s forehand barely made the net.\n\nRuud battled hard, but Nadal would go on to hold his remaining three service games to clinch the opening set in 48 minutes.\n\nThe No. 8 seed was clinging on in the opening game of the second set and conceded three break points, but a cross-court forehand winner at advantage secured an important hold.\n\nWith stars such as footballers Robert Lewandowski and Marco Verratti in attendance, Ruud surprised the crowd inside Philippe-Chatrier when he broke the Nadal serve to love to move into a 3-1 lead.\n\nAt triple break point, Nadal double faulted to hand Ruud the initiative.But Nadal broke straight back. A tense rally at 30-40 went the way of Nadal after Ruud sliced a forehand into the trams.\n\nNadal consolidated on his service game to love to bring the pair level.Nadal then broke the Ruud serve to go 4-3 up.\n\nOn break point, Ruud\u2019s attempted lob with Nadal at the net went just long. Umpire James Keothavong checked the mark to confirm it was out to ensure a third game in a row for Nadal.\n\nRuud\u2019s unforced error count was rising while a purring Nadal continued to apply the pressure off his fierce forehand.\n\nAt 5-3 up, Nadal ripped a cross-court winner on Ruud\u2019s serve to earn himself double set point. Ruud saved three set points, but a double fault saw Nadal take the fourth.\n\nAfter a change of clothes ahead of the third set, Nadal continued to be relentless.\n\nOn Ruud\u2019s serve, he punished an unfortunate shot off net cord from his opponent with a brutal forehand winner before a crisp cross-court backhand secured the break and a seventh game in a row.\n\nAt that point Ruud was floundering. Nadal consolidated his hold to move into a 3-0 lead before sealing the double break and his ninth game in a row when Ruud volleyed into the net.\n\nWith Ruud looking resigned, Nadal eased through the fifth game on his serve.Nadal wrapped up another title win in Paris on the Norwegian\u2019s serve.\n\nAfter a fierce cross-court winner handed him two championship points, Nadal converted the second with a backhand winner down the line to seal a historic achievement.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Besides, our company also focuses on hybrid rice research.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the event was to draw the attention of government and farmers to the successes the company has recorded in its Rice research with GAWAL R1 exchange ideas and take the opportunity to boost food security in Nigeria.\n\nOn its research activities he noted that the company is expanding.\n\n\u201cThis year our company established four trial locations across Nigeria for the experiment and comparison of three elite rice varieties, which are Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1(hybrid rice variety), with one location in Abuja. Based on our yield measurement of 66 m2 for each variety in Abuja, the calculated yields per hectare of Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1 are 5.6 mt, 7.0 mt and 8.7 mt respectively with the transplanting method. GAWAL R1\u2019s yield is 25% higher than that of Faro 44 and Mayun 1 is 55% higher than Faro 44\u201d.\n\nHe said the company was also looking at the establishment of rice extension system and improvement of rice research system in collaboration with the agriculture research institutes such as National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC), IITA, Bwari Area Council and agricultural research and extension services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming to introduce and register many more good quality and high-yield new rice varieties to Nigerian rice farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said that apart from the traditional rice transplanting technique, the company has also been promoting the new technique of broadcasting rice production for large and small-scale farming and the result shows that the rice yield is relatively high as well.\n\nHe said the company was a professional seed company that not only sold seed but taught farmers advanced planting techniques for optimum yield.",

Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",
          "summary": "Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\nAfrica requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change.\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments.\nAfrican Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\nThe mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.",

          "text": "By our correspondent\n\nAn Agricultural based company operating under the aegis of Green Agriculture West Africa Limited, GAWAL has reiterated it\u2019s commitment to contribute to food security in Nigeria via quality and high yielding seeds.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Assistant Managing Director of the company,\n\nMr. Wang Xuemin at the company\u2019s demonstration farm in Usuma, Bwari Area Council of Abuja while conducting top government officials and journalists round the farm as part of activities at the Field Meeting of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) Rice Seed Project.\n\nIn a speech, Mr. Xuemin stated that the project of \u201cHelping West African Countries Establish Rice Seed System\u201d was sponsored by China Country Office of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and implemented by Green Agriculture West Africa Ltd (GAWAL) in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that in 2017 GAWAL successfully registered a high yield rice variety \u2013 GAWAL R1 in Nigeria, which outperforms all local rice varieties returning a yield of over 8 tones per hectares.\n\nThis outstanding result has ensures that more and more people are showing interest in GAWAL R1.\n\n\u201cthrough different channels, a growing number of Nigerian farmers and organizations are reaching us to buy GAWAL R1 rice seeds.Besides, our company also focuses on hybrid rice research.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the event was to draw the attention of government and farmers to the successes the company has recorded in its Rice research with with GAWAL R1 exchange ideas and take the opportunity to boost food security in Nigeria.\n\nOn its research activities he noted that the company is expanding.\n\n\u201cThis year our company established four trial locations across Nigeria for the experiment and comparison of three elite rice varieties, which are Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1(hybrid rice variety), with one location in Abuja. Based on our yield measurement of 66 m2 for each variety in Abuja, the calculated yields per hectare of Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1 are 5.6 mt, 7.0 mt and 8.7 mt respectively with the transplanting method. GAWAL R1\u2019s yield is 25% higher than that of Faro 44 and Mayun 1 is 55% higher than Faro 44\u201d.\n\nHe said the company was also looking at the establishment of rice extension system and improvement of rice research system in collaboration with the agriculture research institutes such as National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), National Agricultural Seeds Council(NASC), IITA, Bwari Area Council and agricultural research and extension services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming to introduce and register many more good quality and high-yield new rice varieties to Nigerian rice farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said that apart from the traditional rice transplanting technique, the company has also been promoting the new technique of broadcasting rice production for large and small-scale farming and the result shows that the rice yield is relatively high as well.\n\nHe said the company was a professional seed company, that not only sell seed but teach farmers advance planting technique for optimum yield.\n\nGAWAL was established in Nigeria in 2006 and has\n\nbeen committed to the agricultural development of Nigeria through the production and supply of quality crop seeds.\n\nAs one of the large-scale seed companies in Nigeria, it has supplied over 20,000 mt rice and maize seeds to Nigeria farmers in over 30 states.",

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

But nice men do not make good leaders, because nice men tend to be nasty,\u201d he said on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today. \u201cNice men should be selling popcorn, and ice cream.\u201d\n\nOn Lawan, he said: \u201cGo to Ohafia or Arochukwu and ask for Ahmed Lawan, the first thing that will come to their mind is that of a tomato dealer who is bringing tomatoes from Maiduguri. Go to any part of the south. Does the brand name sell?\u201d\n\nWhile Shettima faced backlash over the comment, the former governor has said his remarks were never meant to insult Osinbajo or Lawan as perceived in many quarters.\n\n\u201cI never set out to subject them to ridicule but, rather, to stir up interest in the contrasting virtues of the cast of aspirants putting up a fight against my preferred aspirant, one most favoured and advantaged to guarantee APC\u2019s victory in the forthcoming presidential election,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe interpretations of my remarks on @ProfOsinbajo and @SPNigeria, Senator Lawan are, thus, being done literally and overblown.\n\n\u201cMy words weren\u2019t woven to portray them as unworthy aspirants, but merely to qualify them as non-threatening contenders.\n\n\u201cI, however, take full responsibility for my utterances and wish to appeal to our teeming supporters to neither take my words out of their metaphoric contexts nor interpret them as a measure and declaration of hostility towards my dear friends and allies.\n\n\u201cI hereby tender my unreserved apologies to the Vice President and the President of the Senate for the unintended pains my jibes might have caused them and their families and supporters.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria Blames Drop in Electricity Generation on Shutdown of Critical Gas Plant",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Saturday explained that the drop in electricity generation was a result of the partial shutdown of the Oben gas plant for the repair of critical gas processing equipment.\n\nIt has also disclosed that the 14 reactivated independent power plants (IPP) across the country will produce off-grid electricity of 1,000 megawatts.\n\nA statement by the Federal Ministry of Power disclosed that Seplat Energy Plc had mobilised equipment, material, and personnel to the site to expedite the restoration of normal gas supply to the affected power plants.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe wish to notify the general public that the current dip in electricity generation is a result of the partial shutdown of the Oben gas plant to address the repair of critical gas processing equipment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident, unfortunately, occurred at a time when other power plants on other gas sources are undergoing planned maintenance and capacity testing.\n\n\u201cWe wish to notify the public that Seplat Energy Plc has mobilised equipment, material, and personnel to the site to expedite the restoration of normal gas supply to the affected power plants.\n\n\u201cWe have been assured that the repair work would be concluded this weekend and normalcy will be restored. While pleading with electricity consumers with the current state of supply, we wish to assure the general public that efforts are being made for a sustained improvement of supply across the country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Power Abubakar Aliyu has disclosed that the 14 reactivated IPP across the country will produce off-grid electricity of 1,000 MW.\n\nAliyu disclosed the maiden three-day Nigeria-African Natural Resource and Energy Investment Summit hosted by the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development in collaboration with other stakeholders in Abuja.\n\nThe maiden event has the theme: \u201cTowards a Greener Africa\u201d which ended at the weekend.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cgovernment has reactivated 14 IPP Solar Projects across the country. These IPPs, which are currently undergoing Technical and Financial Evaluation, shall contribute 1000MW off-grid. 10 state governments are enabling solar projects in their states that will deliver 100MW each contributing 1,000MW off-grid.\n\n\u201cThe 10MW Katsina Wind Farms already contributing to the grid and is being considered for a solar hybrid that will optimise its availability to 20MW. Once we stabilise the base load through the hydropower plants at various stages of completion, we shall integrate all the off-grid structures to the national grid, increasing our energy mix.\u201d\n\nHe noted that African governments must be proactive and responsive to the course collectively as that is a prerequisite for achieving a cleaner energy future, adding \u201cIt is only by this can Africa actualise its green transition\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further on international partnership toward greener energy, Aliyu said, \u201cCountries, like Nigeria, have made commitments to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the COP26 Agreement in Glasgow.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, we have to scale up our Solar, Wind, hydropower, and even the new hydrogen opportunities, including other new clean technologies.\n\nAfrica needs to focus on proven approaches, as well as the mobilisation of resources to take advantage of carbon-neutral energy sources.\n\nFG Tasks Gas Operators on Accuracy of Dispensing Instruments\n\nIn a related development, the federal government has directed operators in the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) sector to install deadweight at their premises to test the accuracy of weighbridges used for dispensing bulk gas to retailers.\n\nThe government also insisted that henceforth, the use of weighbridges should be the norm at depot terminals when loading LPG products rather than the use of gas meters to ensure that the product being dispensed is accurate since LPG is retailed by weight.\n\nThe resolution came against the backdrop of persistent complaints of under-dispensing of products at LPG depot terminals as well as retail outlets across the country.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s position was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of a one-day stakeholders engagement organised by the Weights and Measures Department of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, with the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas Depot Owners (LPGDO) on the application of legal metrology in the oil and gas sectors in Nigeria.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the outcome of the meeting had already been approved by the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment, Mr. Niyi Adebayo for immediate implementation.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9, which was obtained by THISDAY further, directed that henceforth, tankers used for loading and transporting LPG should ensure that they gauge their tank pressures to conform with safety standards before loading to avoid incurring shortages due to excessive gas in their tanks during loading.\n\nIt also pointed out that as a matter of urgent necessity, the weights and measures department should embark on periodic inspections of the LPG depot terminals to ascertain their level of compliance with operational guidelines.\n\nIt was also agreed that the existing skill gaps noticeable in weighbridges installation should be addressed adding that the quality of gas in the market should be of a high standard with less propane and which should be enforced by the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe federal government however warned that depot terminal operators found to be under-dispensing the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as well as marketers to consumers will be penalised and urged the weights and measures department to strengthen its oversight functions of the numerous LPG retail outlets across the nooks and crannies of the country.\n\nMoreover, on the issue of overlapping duties between the department and NMDPRA, the stakeholders resolved that the activities of the department revolved around the verification and certification of measuring equipment which is statutorily backed by existing legislation while the former dwelled on the issuance of licenses to petroleum product dealers.\n\nThe Director, Weights and Measures Department, Mr. Hassan Ejibunu, however, told THISDAY, \u201cWe\u2019ve been receiving complaints from NALPGAM that whatever they buy in bulk from the terminals, maybe 33,000 litres of LPG, but by the time it gets to the final destination you\u2019ll find out it is less than 33,000 litres \u2013 may be what is left is about 30,000 litres or less than that.\n\n\u201cWe equally received complaints from members of the public that if they go to the retail outlets to buy let\u2019s say 12.5 KG cylinder of LPG, what they\u2019ll get is not up to that.\u201d\n\nHe said the stakeholder\u2019s engagement was convened to address the underlying issues and to ensure that consumers of gas get value and accuracy for every purchase they make.\n\nJames Emejo and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

This prompted his quest to seek the gubernatorial ticket held in trust for him by the Secretary to the State Government, Mr Ibrahim Kashim Mohammed.\n\nChairman of the Electoral Committee of the election, Murtala Damagum, while declaring the results of the election, said that there are a total of 656 delegates in the state.\n\nHe explained that 20 of the delegates are national delegates from each of the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nDamagum added that the remaining 636 delegates cut across the 323 electoral wards of the state.\n\nAnnouncing the results, Damagum, said that 10 delegates were absent, 650 accredited and 646 delegates voted.\n\nAccording to him, Governor Mohammed secured all the 646 votes that were cast.\n\n\u201cI, Hon. Murtala Damagum, by the power vested on me as an Electoral Officer on this occasion, having satisfied all the electoral processes, do hereby, declare our last presidential aspirant and our new gubernatorial aspirant, Senator Bala Mohammed, the winner.\n\n\u201cHe had the total votes of 646 complete votes, he is hereby declared the winner and he is returned elected,\u201d he declared.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Mohammed expressed gratitude to the Secretary to the State government, who had won the first gubernatorial primary election held last week but stepped down for him.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn behalf of myself, my family and the Peoples Democratic Party, I thank God for this day and moment, and I thank the PDP family and the people of Bauchi for giving me the opportunity.\n\n\u201cYou are aware that have gone on a solo trip to run for the presidency of Nigeria and that did not work but today, I must thank my brother, the Secretary to the State government who felt that I should be allowed to go for a second term by stepping down for me.\n\n\u201cWhat he did is not only a sign of loyalty but a spirit of comradeship which he expressed and I will not take that for granted. I am very grateful to God, I\u2019m grateful to the PDP family, and I\u2019m grateful to him (SSG). I will not disappoint him and I must also thank our national leadership for also accepting\n\nKassim was declared the winner of the first gubernatorial primary election held last week but stepped down to pave the way for governor Mohammed.\n\nAs a way of rewarding Kassim, the Bauchi State governor reappointed him as the SSG.\n\nSegun Awofadeji in Bauchi",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has disclosed that the ballot papers for the 2023 elections would be printed locally because it has more than 180 days before the 2023 general election.\n\nThe electoral umpire has also confirmed that it would not keep sensitive electoral materials for the upcoming Ekiti State governorship election with the apex bank.\n\nChairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, stated these in Abuja while responding to questions at a dialogue on elections.\n\nHe further said that the ballot papers for the 2023 elections would be printed locally because it has much time more than 180 days before the 2023 general election.\n\nYakubu said that the ballot papers were printed outside Nigeria in the past elections because of the exigencies of time.\n\nHe disclosed because of the availability of time, the materials for the future elections would be printed locally.\n\nAccording to him, this decision is to guarantee that electoral materials for the lined-up elections are not compromised.\n\nFollowing the revelation that the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele is a card-carrying member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), concerns had been raised about the sanctity of elections materials kept with the apex bank.\n\nBut Yakubu said: \u201cLogistics in an election is much wider than the movement of sensitive material for the election. Take the case of Ekiti for instance, all non-sensitive materials have been delivered to Ado-Ekiti and they are in all the LGAs of the state.\n\n\u201cBut sensitive materials are usually delivered on behalf of the commission by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which are inspected in the presence of the bank and then moved out by our officials.\n\n\u201cI want to say that since INEC started this collaboration with the CBN, we have never experienced a single issue with the movement of materials. The agency has been such a good partner to the commission.\n\nAccording to the INEC chairman\u2019 chairman, \u201cbut we appreciate the current circumstances, and it is for that reason, pending the time we find an alternative, the materials for the Ekiti election will not be routed through the CBN.\n\n\u201cWe will move the material to the airport in Akure and move the material to our office in Ado Ekiti and do the distribution from there. We are not going to use CBN. And when it comes to the general election, we have to look for an alternative way of doing it.\u201d, the INEC chairman stated.\n\nINEC Gives EFCC Accounts Details of APC, PDP\n\nThe INEC chairman also disclosed that the electoral body has given the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) the accounts details of the APC and the PDP.\n\nOn the continuous voter registration, the INEC chairman said that it is only the online registration of voters that was suspended as the transfer and physical registration are still ongoing.\n\nThe INEC chairman acknowledged the receipt of the letter from the EFCC to the commission and stated that it has replied to the anti-graft letter and provided all the information needed.\n\nEFCC had in a letter under sections 38(1) and (2) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004, demanded access to the accounts of the two leading political parties.\n\nThe EFCC in another letter, also signed by the Head of Operations, informed the managing directors of Access Bank and Polaris Bank in Abuja that it was investigating 14 accounts of the two dominant parties.\n\nINEC said that apart from submitting to the EFCC all it required, accounts of political parties are usually audited six months after the general election\n\nINEC Detects 47,633 Voters\u2019 Double Registration in Ekiti\n\nMeanwhile, as Ekiti State prepares for its June 18 governorship election, INEC has stated that it detected 47,633 voters\u2019 double registration on its portal.\n\nThe commission averred that such people have had their registration invalidated to prevent double-voting during the election, with the aid of the Bimodal Voter Authentication System (BVAS) invented by INEC to sanitise its registers.\n\nThe INEC\u2019s Head of Department, Information and Communication Technology, Titilayo Oderinde, made the revelation in Ado Ekiti Saturday during a one-day training workshop organised for Ekiti journalists in preparation for the impending governorship poll.\n\nOderinde, who elucidated on the BVAS application and its significance to the credibility of elections, said no individual can exercise double franchise during the election with the help of the ICT innovation.\n\nHe said: \u201cDuring the just-concluded Continuous Voter Registration exercise declared by INEC for intending voters to update their registration, a total of 124,963 persons registered in Ekiti.\n\n\u201cBut it will marvel you that when the number was subjected to BVAS scrutiny, a total of 47,633 were discovered to have registered twice and got expunged from the register.\n\n\u201cThough, the commission was so lenient that one of the double registrations was struck out leaving one for the voter to exercise his franchise. It does not apply to a gender, the offence was committed by both genders.\n\n\u201cBut I see no reason why people should be doing this when they can approach the commission for migration of their polling units, even if they leave their environment for another location.\u201d\n\nAlso addressing the participants, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Ekiti State, Dr Adeniran Tella, appealed to voters not to treat their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) as instruments for mere identification, saying they are to be deployed to vote on election day.\n\n\u201cPVCs are not designed as an identification card, it is for voting. We want to do away with this voter apathy and we are starting with the Ekiti election. I salute our women for participating well in registration. 71 per cent of them had also collected their PVCs.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring the People Living with Disabilities that their interests will be protected by the commission. They are Nigerians with inalienable rights to vote and we shall provide enabling environment for them to vote in this election, we have made adequate provision for them,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe INEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye, added that part of the constitutional frameworks designed for the success of any election, is freedom of the press, warning that this shouldn\u2019t be abused to prevent violence during the election.\n\nCommission to Deploy 10,269 Personnel for Ekiti Guber Poll\n\nIn a related development, INEC has said that it is making plans to deploy a total of 10,269 personnel for the conduct of the Ekiti State governorship election.\n\nSpeaking at the INEC- Civil Society dialogue session on the Ekiti State Governorship Election organised by the Civil Society Situation Coalition, the Resident Electoral Commissioner for Ekiti State, Mr. Adeniran Tella said that preparations for the exercise is proceeding smoothly.\n\nAt the event held on Saturday in Abuja, Tella said that adequate arrangements are being made for logistics and election security, taking into consideration the challenges of the past.\n\nOn the engagement of personnel including the Adhoc staff, the REC said that members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has been put through training on the rudiments of the new BVAS technology being deployed by the commission for the election.\n\nChuks Okocha Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti",
