          "text": "USA\n\nChairman of Paramount Group, Ivor Ichikowitz, on Thursday, disclosed that Paramount USA, and two of its partners have been selected to enter the final phase of the US Special Forces Command, SOCOM, Armed Overwatch aircraft flight demonstration programme, which could see around 75 aircraft acquired for over the $1 billion programme.\n\nThree teams namely Leidos, Paramount USA and Vertex were among five teams awarded a total of $19.3 million for prototype demonstrations and will advance the Bronco II aircraft to the Phase III Operational Prototype Demonstration later this month.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps probe Police over \u2018missing\u2019 $7.5m recovered loot\n\nIn his remarks, Ichikowitz said: \u201cWe believe that Bronco II is the definitive next generation aircraft, which has been designed to be future-proofed against evolving operational requirements in the asymmetrical battlespace specifically inhabited by SOCOM.\n\n\u201cThrough our partnerships with Leidos, we are looking forward to building upon our 27-year legacy of designing and producing rugged technologically advanced systems. Our team has designed and developed an America centric platform for the world market, and we are looking forward to bringing Bronco II back to America.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Leidos Defence Group president, Gerry Fasano said: \u201cOur team combines decades of experience both integrating and manufacturing cutting-edge airborne solutions for the war fighter. We are thrilled to have been selected to compete in the final phase.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Leidos said the Bronco II is designed for ultimate mission flexibility.\n\n\u201cThe aircraft\u2019s unique internal Interchangeable Multi-Mission System Bay, (IMSB) allows for a single airframe to be easily and rapidly re-configured to perform multiple roles (for instance Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance; Forward Air Control; Close Air Support) incorporating high-performance sensors, network communication systems, precision weapons, an electronic self-protection suite, and mission planning systems.\u201d\n\nThe Bronco II in the United States has been fitted with weapons and sensors by Leidos.\n\nOn its part, SOCOM, in a statement by one of its officials, said: \u201cThe Armed Overwatch acquisition programme aims to provide Special Operations Forces with deployable, affordable and sustainable manned aircraft systems capable of executing close-air support, precision strike and armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance requirements in austere and permissive environments for use in operations against violent extremist organizations.\u201d\n\nSOCOM presently flies U-28 Draco (PC-12) and MC-12 Liberty (King Air 350ER) turboprops for light reconnaissance and forward air control \u2013 they have been deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe new aircraft would be able to launch munitions as well as when necessary.\n\nThe Bronco II is the US specific variant of Paramount\u2019s multi-mission surveillance, reconnaissance and precision strike aircraft, The Mwari, which is being manufactured at Paramount\u2019s Wonderboom factory in Pretoria, South Africa.\n\nThe other teams are Textron Aviation Defence with its AT-6E Wolverine, L3 with its AT-802U Sky Warden, MAG Aerospace with its MC-208 Guardian and Sierra Nevada Corporation with its M28/C-145 Wily Coyote.\n\nSOCOM on May 14th announced the contract awards for demonstrations, which will be carried out at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida between June 14th and July 23rd.\n\nSpecial Operations Command revealed its Armed Overwatch programme in February of 2020.\n\nSOCOM previously evaluated the OV-10G+ Bronco in a field test in Iraq in 2015 as it pursues a light attack capability. The command is looking to budget $101 million for the first new light attack aircraft with another ten per year for the next seven years.\n\nLeidos, Paramount Group USA and Vertex Aerospace in May 2020 announced they had teamed up to pursue the Armed Overwatch contract with the Bronco II intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and light attack aircraft. Leidos is the prime contractor and Paramount and Vertex are primary teammates. The Bronco II would be manufactured in Crestview, Florida and designed to meet the specific needs of US Special Operations Command.\n\nThe Mwari is currently being manufactured for several international customers at Paramount\u2019s Wonderboom factory. The Mwari is the militarised version of the AHRLAC (Advanced High-performance Reconnaissance Light Aircraft) and is designed to incorporate advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, and close air support (CAS) and weapons systems and have operating costs of less than $1,000 an hour, making it cheaper than helicopters and most other fixed-wing competitors.\n\nWeapons options include guided munitions, guided rockets, air-to-ground missiles and a cannon pod.\n\nThe Bronco II will now face off against the AC-208 (armed Cessna Caravan turboprop), M28/C-145 (a new armed version of the Skytruck twin-engine light transport), AT-802U (armed version of the cropduster) and AT-6E Wolverine trainer/light attack aircraft. These aircraft are competing for a roughly 75-aircraft order worth around $900 million.",

          "title": "Why army was authorized to enlist volunteers from Borno \u2015 Buhari",
          "text": "\n\n\n\n\u2014Says FG won\u2019t rest until peace is restored, IDPs return to state\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nPRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital Thursday said that it was in appreciation for the sacrifice made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers in the fight against Boko Haram that the Nigerian Army was authorized to enlist hundreds of the volunteers from the State into the Army.\n\nPresident Buhari also said that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to the North East region was not yet over.\n\nThe President, who was on official visit to Borno State to appraise the security situation and commission some development projects, assured citizens of the Federal Government\u2019s presence in fighting terrorism to the end, and ensuring that Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were fully returned to continue normal lives.\n\nHe commended the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum for his resilience and relentless efforts in rebuilding the state.\n\nThe President attributed recent successes recorded by the military against insurgents and terrorists at Dikwa, Damboa and Gwoza to careful planning, infusion of new equipment and other war materials as well as quality military leadership.\n\nIn a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, President Buhari said, \u201cI am very happy to be here in Borno State once again. I consider Maiduguri and Borno State to be my home since this is the place where I cut my administrative and political teeth, when I first arrived here as Military Governor 46 years ago.\n\n\u201cWhile I am happy to return home, I am not happy that this visit is not a normal, peacetime home-coming. I am here today first and foremost to appraise the security situation in Borno State and the North East region in order to move full speed ahead and conclude the work of restoring permanent peace to the region.\n\n\u201cThe attacks launched by cowardly terrorists against military and civilian targets last month and in previous months were a pointer to us that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to this region is not yet over.\n\n\u201cWe will not rest until all the millions of Internally Displaced Persons are able to return and resettle in their homes and rebuild their shattered lives,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said all the Service Chiefs that were appointed this year either served as Theatre Commanders or were part of the command\u2019s operations at one time or the other.\n\n\u201cAll of them are therefore personally familiar with the challenge of insurgency. I fully expect them to bring this wealth of personal experience to bear as we move to end this scourge once and for all.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these successes owe a lot to the role played by volunteers of the Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes. These good people include women, who are making huge sacrifices and patriotic contributions to our peace-restoration efforts,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that many servicemen and women as well as youthful volunteers had paid the supreme price in the fight to rid our communities and our country of terrorism and insurgency, appreciating their gallantry and their sacrifices.\n\nHe assured their loved ones that the sacrifices will not be in vain.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI must also acknowledge the very important role and the sacrifices made by parents, guardians and other loved ones amongst the people of Borno State, the North East region and the country as a whole, who support their sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in going to battlefields to defend Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and its peace. I thank and commend them for their resilience and assure them success is in sight.\n\n\u201cIt was a mark of our appreciation for this sacrifice made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers that the Nigerian Army was authorised to enlist hundreds of volunteers from Borno State into the Army. I urge the people of Borno State, the North East region and Nigeria as a whole to sustain this cooperation with the military and the other security services. Both must see each other as being on one side in order for us to succeed.\u201d\n\nHe said the late President Idris Deby of Chad played a major role in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region, urging his successors to work hard in restoring democracy to the country and support the processes of bringing peace to the region.\n\nPresident Buhari said the recent appointment of Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, an illustrious son of Borno State, as Special Envoy to Chad and the Lake Chad Basin was intended to accelerate the restoration of democratic stability in Chad Republic and enhance cooperation among all the countries of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me also assure the people of Borno and the North East that we have taken decisive measures to safeguard IDPs and refugees who recently returned from Cameroon and Niger Republic. They are engaged in the task of rebuilding their communities after more than a decade of war and terrorism.\n\n\u201cIt was part of these measures that I gave approval for the Federal Government to build 10,000 resettlement homes in Borno State. 4,000 of these homes have already been completed. Furthermore, I approved for constant release of food intervention by Nigerian Customs Service and the North East Development Commission in order to support displaced persons.\n\n\u201cI have directed these agencies to sustain and deepen this support. I also wish to specially commend His Excellency Governor Babagana Umara Zulum for his tireless efforts in directly supervising the distribution of food and economic empowerment to IDPs in all Local Government Areas,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nThe President noted that the effort at alleviating the suffering of displaced communities will hamper the evil attempts of terrorists and insurgents to recruit fighters and spies from IDPs and other vulnerable populations through the use of paltry material incentives.\n\nOn electricity supply, President Buhari said the administration will continue to make concerted efforts towards guaranteeing energy security to all populace across the nation and Maiduguri cannot, and will not be left out.\n\nThe President said Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation had been directed to expedite the delivery of 50MW power plant in order to ensure the prompt restoration of electricity to Maiduguri and its environs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the light of the current improvement of security in the state, I have also issued directives for the immediate resumption of Oil & Gas exploration activities in the Lake Chad basin. This is part of our overall effort to restore the state back to normalcy.\n\n\u201cOne episode we will never forget in our lives was last year\u2019s cowardly attack on defenceless rice farmers in Zabarmari community. I have directed the Theatre Command of Operation HADIN KAI and other security agencies to work out modalities together with Borno State Government and associations of farmers, on ways to improve safe access by farmers to their farms, forests and fishing grounds.\n\n\u201cI have also directed the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps to accord special support by deploying more agro rangers, through collaboration with Borno State Government, to secure additional farmlands. I highly commend the Borno State Government for its initiative in deploying the agro rangers. We will extend to it our full support,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President said Governor Zulum\u2019s effort at providing facilities that directly impact the livelihood of people, particularly building educational and health institutions, and constructing roads deserved applause.\n\n\u201cI have gone round to commission some of the capital projects executed by Governor Zulum in two years. I am very happy with what I saw. The Vocational Training Institute at Muna, in particular, is a very dynamic answer to skills acquisition and job creation efforts. Such an effort will ensure that in future, there will be no store of unemployed young minds for terrorists and insurgents to recruit from.\n\n\u201cI was exceedingly happy to commission very laudable capital projects executed at the Borno State University. It is the best answer that the decade-long effort of insurgents to disrupt and destroy modern education in this region has come to naught. I have directed the Federal Ministry of Health to liaise with Borno State Government and accord the needed support to the ongoing construction of Borno State University Teaching Hospital in the areas of equipment and personnel.\n\n\u201cFinally, let me, from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of the Federal Government and the people of Nigeria, commend His Royal Highness the Shehu of Borno, as well as all the other Royal Highnesses and Bulamas at all levels for their very exemplary leadership, patience, determination and wisdom during this past decade when this land was ravaged by insurgency and terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe President said the fact that Royal Highnesses now operate from their domains was evidence that peace was being restored to the communities, despite the challenges that remain to be overcome.\n\n\u201cThe elders, statesmen, Muslim and Christian community leaders all over this state and region also deserve our thanks and warm appreciation for their resilience, moral leadership and support for the Federal and State Governments during these trying times.\n\n\u201cI wish to reassure Your Highness the Shehu, all the Royal Highnesses, elders, the Government and people of Borno State and the North East region, of Federal Government\u2019s relentless determination in the search for peace in Borno, the Northeast and the rest of Nigeria. We will never rest until peace is fully restored and all displaced persons are resettled in their home communities.\n\n\u201cI will never forget in my life that during my career as a politician, Borno State is where I got the highest percentage of votes, more than 90 percent! The least I can do for you is to continue the relentless effort to fully restore peace to this state, the North East region and the country as a whole,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Zulum thanked the President for the relative peace enjoyed in the State, buoyed by the heavy presence of military and security men who have been engaging the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed gradual return of peace to Borno State and it is our sincere hope that insurgency will soon be brought to an end,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Governor said he had already spent 750 days in office, appreciating the President for various developmental interventions, which includes infrastructure, particularly the approval of 10,000 units of housing for IDPs of which 4,000 had been completed.\n\nThe Governor thanked the President for approval of a Federal Polytechnic in Mongonu after forty years of creation, 1976, urging more security presence so that farmers can return to their major occupation.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ibrahim Wuyo\n\nChairman of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Audu Ogbe has said that at no time in our nation\u2019s chequered history since the civil war has we been in greater need of cherished ideals such as integration, confidence-building and cohesion measures, than now.\n\nA statement issued to Journalists on Thursday by the ACF National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, indicated that Audu Ogbe made the remarks at a meeting with Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and other leaders, recently.\n\nChief Audu Ogbe, at the meeting, explained that at no time has the realisation of these cherished ideals he mentioned, become more challenging and almost unattainable.\n\nAccording to the ACF chairman, \u201cvicious criminality has sown fear in all. Economic challenges exacerbate pain in our daily lives and mistrust continues to aggravate division everywhere. \u201c\n\nAlso Read: Our management not under Senate\u2019s probe -NSITF\n\n\u201cSo who will listen to whom? But do we surrender to despair, yield to anarchy and chaos? No, we cannot. \u201c\n\n\u201cThat would be defeatism in the extreme. Integration? At this time when the trumpets of disintegration are blaring so loud from so many quarters? Confidence building in the midst of near-panic? Cohesion measures when the glue of unity seems so dry and weak? \u201c\n\n\u201cBesides the tension and apprehension engendered by the endless devaluation of our currency with the attendant inflationary pressure on society make life too rough for society to listen to sermons on nationalism and patriotism. But we must try because the alternative is unthinkable. \u201c\n\n\u201cLuckily too, there is still a vast abundance of goodwill and resolve by Nigerians to stay together and overcome our challenges. Perhaps it is time for the executive arm from federal to state levels to request our elected representatives to embark on a fresh mission to the people in which a fresh message of integration shall be delivered, while the challenges confronting governments can be brought to their knowledge. \u201c\n\n\u201cRegional groups, socio-cultural associations, religious and other community leaders can and should equally be fully briefed and mobilised to lend support to this effort. We are a religious people, very religious indeed, but not particularly godly in view of our weaknesses in public and private pursuits, but God is good and will not ignore our prayers and abandon us in our hour of need.\u201d\n\n\u201cI may add that nothing will better create confidence than the immediate set-up through appropriate mechanisms of special courts to try those caught in transgressions, such as kidnapping, murder, rape, arson, trafficking in human parts and possession and marketing of dangerous weapons. \u201c\n\n\u201cLet the public hear that government is proactive. Let the guilty be penalised and the innocent set free as dictated by the principles of the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201d For the current circumstance where there is total silence on the judicial front, there is too much room for speculation, mischief, outright lies that those arrested are being let off through the back door on ethnic and religious grounds. We wish to say that among the multiplicity of challenges confronting us, one very tough one is the economy. There is no doubt that this administration has invested heavily in infrastructure and we commend them heartily. A strong infrastructural outlay is the only guarantee for solid and lasting economic growth. \u201c\n\n\u201cHowever, the continuous devaluation of our currency is fueling inflation and creating unbearable stress for the citizenry. Interest rates are still too stiff for productive investments and job creation. \u201c\n\n\u201cIndustrialisation is stil near impossible. The Central Bank is making great efforts but more needs to be done to bring relief to the unemployed and near-hopeless youths in our society. They are our sons and daughters. Fina ly, we must continue to have faith in God. he did not bring this huge edifice caled Nigeria together only to let it go to waste. By His Grace and Love, we shal overcome,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Bayelsa State Government has criticised in strong terms the current revenue sharing formula in Nigeria, saying it is unjust, inadequate and unacceptable.\n\nThe State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, also faulted the 13 per cent derivation paid to oil producing states by the federal government.\n\nSpeaking at the Chief DSP Alamieyeseigha Banquet Hall, Government House, Yenagoa, on Thursday during the launch of a book entitled \u201cThe Riddle of The Oil Thief\u201d, authored by the Ibenanaowei of Ekpetiama Kingdom, King Bubaraye Dakolo, he lamented the injustice in the sharing formula of proceeds from oil.\n\nHe said the formula denied the people of the state and the Niger Delta region of their resources and the development they deserve and called for a review.\n\nDiri, said the recognition of local governments as federating units against the dictates of the Nigerian Constitution, has equally denied Bayelsa of its resources given the fact that the state had only eight local government areas.\n\nHe advocated the creation of more local governments for the state as a way of resolving some of the imbalances in the sharing formula.\n\nHe noted with sadness that despite the enormous oil wealth in Bayelsa and the Niger Delta, very few sons of the region have oil blocs or have benefited from the oil wealth.\n\nHe called for constant dialogue as a way of addressing the issues in the sharing formula of the country, stressing that his administration would continue to advocate for a better deal for people of the state and region.\n\nThe governor commended the author of the book, which he said captured the story of the people of the state and other oil-bearing communities in the region.\n\nHe directed that the book be introduced into the curriculum of senior classes of post-primary schools in the state to enable the people understand the history and politics of oil as it affected the region and the state.\n\n\u201cThe current revenue sharing formula is totally unacceptable to us as a people. We cannot have 100 per cent of our own resources and 13 per cent of what we don\u2019t even know is being given to us while 87 per cent is taken away by the Federal Government. That is not fair. That is injustice and we would continue to preach against that.\n\n\u201cI am happy today that with all of our struggles, you have been able to put pen to paper. A philosopher once said, write your story before your ink dries up. Today, you have written our story, the story of Bayelsa and Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cThis book will bridge the existing gaps of our story as a state and as an ethnic nationality in Nigeria. It is on this note that I direct all senior secondary classes in post-primary schools to adopt this book in their curriculum. The reason been that our children should know the history of oil politics as it affects us and the larger Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the author, King Bubaraye Dakolo, said his decision to write the book was borne out of his desire to tell the story of the suffering and deprivation suffered by the people of the Niger Delta with a view to addressing the injustice.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to Governor Diri and all those who supported the writing of the book and made the launch possible.\n\nThe first class traditional ruler lamented the misuse of oil resources, which he said would have solved the problems of the region and country if properly used and called for psychological clean-up of the people of the region who have suffered decades of neglect.\n\nEarlier, chairman of the occasion, Engr. Gesi Asamowei, who decried the continuous degradation of the Niger Delta region, lauded the author for documenting the story of the people of the region.",

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has warned the newly sworn-in chairmen of the 23 local government areas of the state against borrowing money without first notifying the state government.\n\nThe governor gave the warning shortly after the chairmen took their oaths of office at the Banquet Hall, Government House, Port Harcourt on Thursday.\n\nWike said the caution was necessary to stem unguarded desire of some council chairman to access money without any developmental plan.\n\nHe said: \u201cDon\u2019t go and borrow money without the state government approval. Some of you tried it last time and started with your blackmail, saying help us, we are finished.\n\n\u201cYou have no authority to go and borrow money. Even we as State government, before we go and borrow money we get approval from the Debt Management Office. No bank will even give us.\n\n\u201cBefore you borrow money, the state must know what you want to use it for, and how you will pay it back. So, that others, who are coming will not suffer because of your indebtedness.\u201d\n\nThe governor revealed that he prevented the immediate past chairmen from paying local government workers\u2019 salaries following security reports and complains by some councillors and political appointees that they would not be paid their entitlements.\n\n\u201cSo I decided to suspend the payment of local government workers and political appointees, so that the newly sworn-in chairmen will have to pay them without any crisis whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\nWike said the state government would set up a committee to oversee the payments of all entitlements of immediate past chairmen, their political appointees and councillors.\n\n\u201cAll the former council chairmen, all political appointees and councillors must be paid their money,\u201d he said.\n\nWike also charged the council chairmen to pay proper attention to issues of security to stem likely security breaches in their various councils.\n\nThe governor particularly urged them to establish a robust working relationship with the Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) and the traditional rulers for regular security meetings and briefings.\n\nHe said: \u201cStay in your council areas. Don\u2019t stay in hotels and in Port Harcourt. If you\u2019re not at home, how do you know about the security situation in your local government? Security is key.\n\n\u201cRelate with your DPOs. It does not cost you anything. Even if it cost you, governance is not easy. Governance is expensive. Security is expensive. Some of you cannot relate to the DPOs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only when you have a problem that you relate with your DPOs and some of them are intelligent and when you call them that time, they turn their face the other way. You must make effort to relate with your DPOs.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged the council chairmen to ensure regular Security Council meetings.\n\nWike warned them against embarking on needless travel outside the state and the country without notifying the state government.\n\nHe also encouraged them to work to strengthen the unity of the party in their various councils, consult widely with the leaders over appointments, and on other issues that could give everybody a sense of belonging.\n\nThe governor frowned on the worsening sanitary conditions particularly in Obio-Akpor, Port Harcourt city, Eleme, Oyigbo Local Government Areas, and charged the council chairmen to work assiduously to regularly evaluate refuse dumped on major roads in their councils.\n\nWike said he had received an intelligence report that some council chairmen had vowed they would not inaugurate some elected councillors perceived to be opposed to them.\n\nHe warned that appropriate sanction would be taken against such erring council chairmen.\n\nThe newly sworn-in chairmen are, Daniel E. O. Daniel ( Abua-Odual), Benjamin I. Eke (Ahoada East), Hope O. Ikiriko (Ahoada West) Rowland Sekibo (Akuku-Toru), Awortu Erastus (Andoni), Onengiyeofori George (Asari-Toru), Irimagha David ( Bonny), Michael J. Williams (Degema), Obarilormate Ollor (Eleme), Dr. Lloyd Chidi J.( Emohua), Obinna Anyanwu (Etche), Deko Confidence (Gokana), Nwanosike Samuel (Ikwerre).\n\nOthers are Bariere Thomas (Khana), Ariolu C. George (Obio-Akpor), Nemieboka Vincent (Ogu/Bolo), Akuro Tobin (Okrika), Nwaiwu Chisorom (Omuma), Vincent Job (Onelga), Enyiada Cookey Gam (Opobo/Nkoro) Nwaogu Akara (Oyigbo), Ihunda Allwell (Phalga) And Mbakpone Okpe (Tai).",

Strict adherence to the guide on compulsory biometric verification of every candidate is required.\n\nThe board warned that no candidate should be kept waiting if he/she cannot be verified. It said such a candidate should be recaptured at the centre before leaving and that only genuine cases would subsequently be treated.\n\n\u201cThere is no other attendance register apart from the biometric verification.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, asked for an amendment to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act to enable it regulate the use of the Internet by private broadcasting stations as well as other online broadcast media.\n\nMinister of Information and Orientation, Lai Mohammed, said the government has a duty to monitor all broadcast contents in the country.\n\nMohammed spoke at a public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values on a bill seeking to amend the NBC Act.\n\nHowever, stakeholders in the media industry kicked against the proposal which came barely a week after the NBC had asked all social media platforms and online broadcasting service providers to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nGovernment moved to license social media companies after Twitter took down a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, after stating that the message violated its policy.\n\nIn the tweet, the president had threatened to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe bill sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values, Segun Odebumni and two others is seeking an amendment for the NBC Act.\n\nSection 2c of the proposed amendment listed the categories of licenses to be granted which include Cable Television Services, Direct Satellite broadcast, Direct to Home, IPTV, Radio, EPG and Digital Terrestrial television; radio and television stations owned, established or operated by the federal, state and local governments, broadcast signal distribution, Online broadcast, community broadcasting, public service broadcasting, among others.\n\nThe Information Minister said: \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have responsibility to monitor content, including Twitter.\u201d\n\nOn a proposal that the NBC should regulate and provide digital broadcasting in Nigeria in line with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) agreement 2006, he said the laws of the country cannot be subservient to any treaty\n\n\u201cWith due respect, our laws cannot be subservient to international telecommunication union treaties. It is true that we are part of the treaty, but our laws and act cannot be made subservient to any treaty. Treaties re made, but our laws will have to protect peculiar situations in our country. So, will suggest we take another look at this.\u201d\n\nBut the Institute for Media and Society (IMS), International Press Centre (IPC) and Centre for Media Law and Advocacy (CMLA) faulted the proposal.\n\nThey argued that inclusion of internet broadcast and online media to the category of broadcast service licenses to be issued by the NBC will be injurious to freedom of expression and press freedom.\n\nThe CSOs, in a memorandum submitted to the committee, also kicked against a proposal to empower the NBC to fix price for Pay-TV in the proposed amendment.\n\nExecutive Director of IPC, Mr. Lanre Arogundade said fixing tariffs arbitrarily could lead to excessive pricing, which could discourage investment in the sector.\n\nArogundade argued that the conduct of NBC over time presented it as an extension of the office of the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\n\u201cFixing tariffs arbitrarily could lead to excessive pricing that has the potential of discouraging investment in the sector and the attendant job losses. Giving the NBC the sole right over tariff issues which cannot be interfered with could be interpreted as an ouster clause that arrogates to it arbitrary powers that cannot be challenged even in the court of law.\u201d\n\nIn his intervention, Akin Akingbulu, executive director, IMS said the commission should not receive directives from the minister.\n\n\u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section six should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector,\u201d he said.\n\nIn their joint submission, IPC and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy said the appointment of the NBC board should be subject to the confirmation of the national assembly.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of the NBC has over time presented it as an extension of the minister of information and culture which rarely acts independently,\u201d they said.\n\nOnly recently, NBC had asked all social media platforms and online broadcasting service providers to apply for broadcast licence.\n\nIts Director General, Armstrong Idachaba, gave the directive in a newspaper advertorial following Federal Government\u2019s announcement that Twitter and other social media platforms must register as a Nigerian company for them to do business in Nigeria.\n\nIdachaba said in the advertorial that the NBC establishment code empowers the commission to ask the companies to be licensed.",

This sets the stage for trail of the actor at the High Court on charges bothering on rape, sexual assault and abuse of a minor.\n\nThe magistrate, while turning down Baba Ijesha\u2019s application for bail, said: \u201cI have carefully considered the application of the counsel to the defendant seeking bail for the defendant and the opposition by the counsel from the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP).\n\n\u201cSince there are indications that the matter is before the high court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given.

The actor was limping and visibly shaking \u2013 an appearance which suggested a bad health condition.\n\nThe court clerk read out five count charges of indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a Child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault-which contravenes sections 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015.\n\nThe actor pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.\n\nWhile in the dock, Baba Ijesha showed signs of discomfort as he kept bending intermittently. The concerned magistrate, noticing the stress of the defendant, asked if he was fine.\n\n\u201cAre you okay? Do you want to sit down? Give him a chair to sit on,\u201d the magistrate said.\n\nThe actor was arrested in April over alleged defilement of a 14-year-old foster daughter of actress/comedienne, Princess.",

He was said to have attempted to run away from the hoodlums but could not, as they had him surrounded.\n\nThe lawmaker, who confirmed the incident, expressed shock and said he was still in disbelief on why he was attacked.\n\n\u201cMy security man was not just killed, but was beheaded. I call on security operatives to strengthen security in Orsu LGA and ensure that lives and property are protected,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a related development, the lawmaker also confirmed an attack on the country home of immediate past Attorney General of the state, Cyprian Akaolisa, in the same council area the same day.\n\nHe said the gunmen first attacked the erstwhile Commissioner for Justice before heading to his own home.\n\nHe confirmed that the houses were burnt, but no lives were lost except his guard who was beheaded.\n\nSimilarly, Daily Sun gathered that the gunmen also beheaded an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in the area, Jonathan Ugochukwu.\n\nVillage sources, also, revealed that the house and vehicle of the councillor representing Amaebu Ebenatu ward, Clifford Mazi, was not spared by the gunmen as they set it on fire, fortunately, he was said not to be around when the hoodlums stormed his home.\n\nAlso, the gunmen razed the house of the President General of Amaebu Ebenatu, Oliver Ejelonu, who was said to have narrowly escaped before they invaded his house.\n\nWife of the APC chieftain, Mrs Nkechi Ugochukwu, disclosed that the gunmen carried her husband outside and beheaded him before torching their house.\n\nMrs Ugochukwu said that the gunmen went away with her husband\u2019s head. A community source also revealed that the rampaging gunmen also left with the head of the lawmaker\u2019s guard.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe hoodlums did not meet the lawmaker and, in anger, they beheaded his gate man and left with his head.\n\n\u201cThey also invaded the house of another APC chieftain here, Jonathan Ugochukwu, burnt his house, beheaded him and left with his head. They also burnt the houses of the president general and the councillor representing our ward.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the former Attorney General, Akaolisa, said that he had reported the incident to the police.

          "text": "Says banking sector remains liquid, well capitalised\n\nBy Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised the federal government to keep reliance on overdrafts from the Central Bank Bank of Nigeria ((CBN) within legal limits.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institution said this should be done while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\nSection 38(1) of the CBN Act allows the apex bank to grant overdrafts to the federal government to address any temporary deficiency of budget revenue, with sub-section 2 providing that any outstanding overdraft shall not exceed 5 per cent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the federal government.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s admonition was contained in a statement from preliminary findings of a virtual visit to Nigeria by its staff.\n\nAccording to the IMF, real gross domestic product (GDP) is recovering but unemployment and inflation remain elevated, noting that recent exchange rate measures were encouraging.\n\nIt, however, called for reforms to achieve a fully unified and market-clearing exchange rate, even as it expressed concern on the re-emergence of fuel subsidies, particularly in the context of low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe IMF team led by Ms. Jesmin Rahman, the statement added, held virtual meetings with the Nigerian authorities between June 1 and 8, 2021 to discuss recent economic, financial developments and outlook.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Nigerian economy has started to gradually recover from the negative effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Following sharp output contractions in the second and third quarters, GDP growth turned positive in Q4 2020 and growth reached 0.5 per cent (y/y) in Q1 2021, supported by agriculture and services sectors.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the employment level continues to fall dramatically and together with other socio-economic indicators, is far below pre-pandemic levels. Inflation slightly decelerated in May but remained elevated at 17.9 per cent, owing to high food price inflation.\n\n\u201cWith the recovery in oil prices and remittance flows, the strong pressures on the balance of payments have somewhat abated, although imports are rebounding faster than exports and foreign investor appetite remains subdued resulting in continued FX shortage.\n\n\u201cThe incipient recovery in economic activity is projected to take root and broaden among sectors, with GDP growth expected to reach 2.5 per cent in 2021.\u201d\n\nThe IMF noted that inflation is expected to remain elevated in 2021, but likely to decelerate in the second half of the year to reach about 15.5 per cent, following the removal of border controls and the elimination of base effects from elevated food price levels.\n\nTax revenue collections, it observed, are gradually recovering, adding that: \u201cWith fuel subsidies resurfacing, additional spending for Covid-19 vaccines, and to address security challenges, the fiscal deficit of the Consolidated Government is expected to remain elevated at 5.5 per cent of GDP,\u201d it said.\n\nThe multilateral financial institution stated that downside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, and the still uncertain course of the COVID-19 pandemic both globally and in Nigeria.\n\nWhile commending the authorities\u2019 measures to contain the transmission of Covid-19 in Nigeria, including the ongoing vaccination programmes under the COVAX initiative, it strongly expressed support to the authorities\u2019 efforts to acquire additional doses from countries with surplus stocks.\n\nHowever, it expressed its concern with the resurgence of fuel subsidies, reiterating the importance of introducing market-based fuel pricing mechanism and the need to deploy well-targeted social support to cushion any impact on the poor.\n\nThe IMF mission recommended stepping up efforts to strengthen tax administration to mobilise additional revenues and help address priority spending pressures.\n\nIt urged the authorities to keep reliance on CBN overdrafts for deficit financing within legal limits, while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\nIt also described as encouraging the recent removal of the official exchange rate from the CBN website and measures to enhance transparency in the setting of the NAFEX exchange rate.\n\nThe IMF called for the sustenance of the momentum towards fully unifying all exchange rate windows and establishing a market-clearing exchange rate.\n\nOn monetary policy to strengthen the monetary targeting regime, it recommended integrating the interbank and debt markets and using central bank or government bills of short maturity as the main liquidity management tool, instead of the cash reserve requirements.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the Nigerian banking sector remains liquid and well-capitalised, while non-performing loans (NPLs) are contained.\n\nBut it advised that the extension of the moratorium on principal payments of qualifying credit facilities on a case-by-case basis through March 2022 should be limited to viable debtors with strong pre-crisis fundamentals.\n\n\u201cCBN stress tests purport that the banking system would remain adequately capitalized except in case of a severe deterioration of credit quality.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it remains to be seen what share of forborne loans may turn non-performing as the impact of the pandemic abates. Since NPLs often rise at the later part of economic crisis, CBN\u2019s strong oversight remains critical to safeguarding financial sector stability.\n\n\u201cThe IMF mission would like to thank the authorities and other counterparts for the open and thoughtful discussions and excellent cooperation,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies jointness, synergy and cooperation,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nThe President who used the occasion to condole with the families of the nation\u2019s fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, said: \u201cI want to assure you that this administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country, are well cared for.\u201d\n\nHe however charged the men of the Armed Forces to continue the great work of defending the nation, he said: \u201cWe should not allow our adversaries the opportunity or breathing space to challenge or undermine our national interests and core values. The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality.\u201d\n\nHe said side by side with the efforts of the Armed Forces and security agencies, his Administration was already developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building.\n\n\u201cConcerted efforts are being made to fast-track re-construction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East,\u201d the President added.\n\nHe said he would continue to ensure that wounded soldiers received the best medical attention towards their full recovery.\n\nHe told the soldiers that he was aware of their collective efforts at decimating and degrading the terrorists and reaffirming the inviolable sovereignty of Nigeria, stressing that their steadfastness and untiring efforts in the face of the difficulties they experience in the Theatres of Operation is to his knowledge.\n\n\u201cYour collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today.

I want to seize this opportunity to put it on record that our nation will forever be indebted to you, for your patriotic commitment to the defence of our fatherland against insurgency and criminality.\n\nI therefore commend you and remember all the personnel who have paid the supreme sacrifice in ensuring that Nigeria remains an indivisible and secure entity. As I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, I want to assure you that this administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country, are well cared for. Furthermore, we will continue to ensure that our wounded comrades get the best medical attention towards their full recovery. While acknowledging your collective efforts at decimating and degrading the terrorists and reaffirming the inviolable sovereignty of our nation, I also wish to extol your steadfastness and untiring efforts in the face of the difficulties you experience in the Theatres of Operation. Your collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today. Under my watch, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have been provided a firm strategy and clear sense of direction to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. We should not allow our adversaries the opportunity or breathing space to challenge or undermine our national interests and core values. The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality. I am particularly happy to note the increasing understanding and cooperation within the military, as well as the inter-agency cooperation in the fight against the terrorists and other criminal elements in the North East. The outcome of this synergy is evidenced by the successes recorded in the ongoing Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO which has so far degraded the insurgents\u2019 capabilities in the Timbuktu Triangle, Sambisa Forest and the Lake Chad Region. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies \u201cjointness, synergy and cooperation.\u201d By pooling together, the collective resources and comparative advantages of the Armed Forces and other security agencies, we hope the enemy will now feel the ferocity of our firepower and the weight of our resolve. Side by side with the efforts of the Armed Forces and security agencies, this Administration is developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building. Concerted efforts are being made to fast-track re-construction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East. I am hopeful that this will lead to the speedy resettlement of displaced persons, as well as the restoration of bubbling community life as the people return to their homes. Alongside investment in development and reconstruction, we will sustain our investment in the Armed Forces in a manner that balances the \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d. Several interventions by this government have led to the procurement and delivery of large consignments of critical combat enablers, including high calibre weapons and ammunition. Many have been injected into the Theatre and soon other equipment that have just arrived the country would also be deployed to the Theatre of operations. Much more equipment will be procured for the Armed Forces to cater for both the short and long-term requirements. I would like, at this point to also commend the hierarchy of our Armed Forces for their strategic foresight in ensuring that some of our critical military equipment are fabricated locally. The repairs and maintenance of some of these vital weapons are now being carried out in the country thereby saving the nation a lot of foreign exchange and also creating jobs for our teeming population. As personnel of our Armed Forces and security agencies, you must understand that these items of equipment must be put to good use against the terrorists and other criminal elements. There is no room for complacency, and no need to be less than 100 per cent alert at all times. As your Commander-in-Chief, I want to assure you that this government will continue to work towards the provision of timely funding and procurement of equipment for the Armed Forces and other security agencies. This is intended to boost the prosecution of the ongoing war to a logical conclusion and also to serve our collective interests and well-being. In addition, your welfare is of utmost importance and concern to this government. I am glad that the gradual rotation of the troops in the field has commenced, as I directed. I am sure that this will minimize and possibly eliminate battle fatigue, as well as enhance troops\u2019 morale. I now wish to thank you for your unalloyed loyalty and selfless sacrifices towards the defence of our country. Your courage and gallantry will continue to inspire others, as they echo into the future. While I commend your resilience, let me remind you that there is still a lot of work to be done, to completely restore peace to the North East, stem the activities of armed bandits in the North West and North Central, as well as deal with other security challenges across the country. You must therefore remain steadfast and see this war to a conclusive end. In doing so, you must rely on interagency cooperation, strengthen your cohesion with the troops of neighboring Republics of Cameroon, Chad and Niger in our collective fight against the terrorists, under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force. This will consolidate our efforts and facilitate the speedy return of peace and stability to the region. Once again I salute your courage and wish you the best, as you continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nGod bless you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Some of the legislators who claimed to lack the required financial deposits were also assisted to access loans by the CBN governor.\u201d\n\nOther sources listed infractions involving the CBN governor and his role in diverting the traditional agricultural insurance responsibility of the government insurance company to private companies in which his family members have an interest.\n\n\u201cThe 9th Assembly of National Assembly under Senator Ahmad Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila can better be described as a compromised and silenced legislative arm of government under the current dispensation. No thanks to free access to contracts, cash, and patronage from strategic revenue-generating agencies under the legislative supervisory power of the legislators.\n\n\u201cThe legislators and their principal officers have graduated from constituency project implementation to allocation of slots in employment, where the current Minister of Humanitarian Affairs also settled them with N-Power and conditional Cash Transfer slots contrary to principles guiding the projects,\u201d another source stated.",

By the end of 2018, it processed an average of $160 million transactions per month by supporting the operations of 26 banks.\n\nA year later, it launched Moniepoint, a platform for agent banking.\n\nAs one of the \u201cSuper Agents\u201d licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, TeamApt\u2019s Moniepoint powers thousands of shops where typical banking transactions \u2013 deposits, withdrawals, account opening and more \u2013 are now performed in Nigeria using point-of-sale devices.\n\nBut facing competition from other players, how well is Moniepoint performing?\n\nLeading the pack\n\nTosin Eniolorunda, TeamApt\u2019s founder and CEO, is confident that it is the industry\u2019s number one.\n\nHis audacity is based on data from SANEF, the body empowered by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria. According to this data, TeamApt accounts for 74% of the agent banking industry based on the volume of transactions processed monthly.\n\nSANEF\u2019s agent banking data is not public. It is sent confidentially to startups in the sector. TechCabal has not independently verified ranks of performance among these companies.\n\nEniolorunda points to the company\u2019s transaction value numbers as another measure of TeamApt\u2019s maturity in the fintech sector \u2013 and future valuation.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time, according to the CEO. The value for May was \u20a61.4 trillion ($3.5 bn) from a base of 68 million transactions. Total value of transactions TeamApt has processed between April 2020 and April 2021 is $16 bn.\n\nTeamApt says it processed $3.5bn in May 2021, thanks to its leading share of Nigeria\u2019s agent banking sector\n\nThese transactions are from four use cases: deposit, withdrawal, as well as airtime and bill payments. Moniepoint, the company says, has 14 million unique customers monthly.\n\nUnicorn calling?\n\nEniolorunda does not specify what the company\u2019s present valuation is. But based on the above numbers and those of other Nigerian fintechs, he believes TeamApt seats comfortably among the continent\u2019s most valued startups.\n\n\u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal earlier in May.\n\nIn March, Flutterwave said it had processed over 140m transactions worth over $9bn since its founding.\n\nAvailable numbers for Opay are from 2020; the Opera-backed company claimed to have processed $1.4 bn in October and $2bn in December of that year. Paga, on the other hand, processed $2.3 billion in 2020 and $8 billion over the last four years according to CEO Tayo Oviosu.\n\nBig Milestone for Paga @mypaga & Digital Acceleration\n\n\n\nWe crossed 3 Trillion Naira in transaction values processed since the start of commercial operations in 2012.\n\n\n\nHit N2 Trillion in March 2020\n\n\n\nHit N3 Trillion in May 2021\n\n\n\n15 months to process 1 Trillion!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 #JustPagait \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) June 7, 2021\n\nNot much is known about Firstmonie, also in the agent banking heavyweight category. Observers say it is more private due to its ownership by First Bank.\n\nUnless TeamApt is acquired for a billion dollars or goes public, the only available way to estimate its valuation will come after a funding round.\n\nRumors of an announcement circulated briefly in May but the company has yet to officially declare a round. Its last fundraise was $5.5m Series A in February 2019, led by Jim Ovia\u2019s Quantum Capital.\n\nAt a media event this week Thursday, Eniolorunda confirmed the round \u2013 \u201ca couple of tens of million\u201d \u2013 has been closed. Another \u2013 \u201ca lot more\u201d \u2013 is in progress.\n\nWhen these are announced, a clearer picture will emerge of the company\u2019s valuation, direction and, more broadly, investor appetite for high-growing fintech companies in Africa.\n\nFlutterwave and Chipper Cash have made headlines in the first half of the year with $100-million-plus rounds that catapulted them to unicorn status. OPay is reported to have a $400 million deal in the works which could value it at $1.5bn, and Paga expects to be a unicorn in a year or two.\n\nIs TeamApt next in line?\n\nDigital bank on the horizon\n\nMeanwhile, the company is evolving to a more consumer-facing company.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we are directing our business towards becoming a digital bank,\u201d Enioolorunda says.\n\nIn this new direction, Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking but will also be used as an app by individuals as a digital bank. Eniolorunda says this \u201chybrid approach\u201d is essential to truly serve underserved people in Africa who, for good reason, retain a need to physically visit service providers when quality falls short.\n\nThe other expansion on the company\u2019s playbook is geographical; TeamApt plans to start operating in the \u201cthird-largest francophone country\u201d in Africa by the third quarter of the year, the CEO says.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Banks and startups need to partner for growth but who can solve the risks involved?",
          "text": "Five Nigerian banks have signed up as pioneer members of a new initiative that aims to increase partnerships between corporations and startups in emerging markets.\n\nThe initiative is called the Circle of Corporate Investors and is organised by Catalyst Fund, an accelerator operating in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe aim is to help startups and corporates \u201cbetter discover technical and commercial synergies while sharing learnings and insights with the wider industry,\u201d says Maelis Carraro, Catalyst Fund\u2019s managing director.\n\nThe banks joining the partnership are Access, Sterling, Ecobank, and Fidelity. VFD Group, an investment company that owns VBank, a digital bank, has also signed up.\n\nThe startup-corporates face-off\n\nAdvances in digital technology have limited the barrier to service delivery in sectors like financial services. As mobile phones replace office buildings as access points, competition has increased between slow-moving old corporations and agile up-starts.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, the likes of Paystack and Flutterwave have taken command of online payments, enough to make respected institutions like Guaranty Trust Bank set up new structures to counter the threat.\n\nBut emerging market narratives of disruption that pit startups and corporates against each other gloss over many avenues of collaboration that currently lie fallow.\n\nFor all that is impressive about the current state of tech progress, the reality is that traditional corporates retain a stronger hold of offline markets and cover wider geographies than startups.\n\nOne example is Access bank. Founded in 1988, it has risen through managerial adjustments and corporate acquisitions to become Nigeria\u2019s largest bank.\n\nAccess has 36 million customers across 600 service locations in 12 countries on three continents. Somewhere in there is a trove of market resources that will be invaluable for startups that enter into strategic partnerships with the bank. Landing such a partner can signal a startup\u2019s ambition to competitors and legitimacy to customers.\n\nCorporates could benefit from startups\u2019 agility, innovation and flexibility to increase value to customers and speed up digital innovation, Carrro said.\n\nWhile their history and coverage are impressive, traditional banks were slow in pushing Nigeria past a 3% credit penetration mark until digital lenders came on board with avant-garde instant loans.\n\nBut partnerships are risky, yes?\n\n\u2018Leverage my market and network, while I leverage your tech and agility\u2019 should create a win-win for both sides. However, such business partnerships are not straightforward.\n\nA 2019 Harvard Business Review article explained that \u201cdisparities in size, structure and power\u201d can make it difficult for startups to connect with the right nodes within a large corporation. These disparities throw up risks for both parties.\n\nA startup may spend too much time building a custom solution for one large corporate partner, thereby failing to think of itself as a platform that can scale universally. Also, the corporate partner, distracted by other interests, may not devote the requisite high-level manpower to make the best of this partnership.\n\nThere are risks for corporates too. Startups are experiments and could come with reputational risks for corporates when they fail or splinter into some sort of scandal. As this World Economic Forum whitepaper notes, \u201cmany start-ups fail, so the investment risk for corporates is high compared to their usual investment projects.\u201d\n\nFrom the above, it becomes clear that for startup-corporate partnerships to succeed, some work needs to be done to mitigate the risks involved. It is possible that startups and corporates can, on their own, set up the right structures and interfaces to reduce such risks.\n\nBut what if a middleman does the work?\n\nDe-risking partnerships\n\nWith its Circle of Corporate Investors, Catalyst Fund hopes to be a partnerships accelerator by providing an ecosystem of tools that de-risk partnerships.\n\nIn its best form, such an accelerator should add precision to how corporates source, assess, and implement new innovations for their customers. Though its first members are banks, the initiative has plans to include telcos, FMCGs and logistics providers.\n\nThe perks of membership for corporates includes access to Catalyst Fund\u2019s portfolio of 40+ active startups in three regions. In Africa, that portfolio includes Chipper Cash, Cowrywise, Sokowatch and 27 other startups.\n\nCatalyst Fund is also promising \u2018custom toolkits\u2019 that will strengthen and streamline partnership processes. It plans to facilitate \u201cknowledge sharing roundtables\u201d with global corporate innovators.\n\nUntil now, Catalyst Fund\u2019s main focus has been to offer venture building support \u2013 product design, marketing strategy, and more to startups.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this experiment will fare. They point to helping Unilever reach millions of new consumers through Sokowatch as one instance of what they can help achieve.\n\nEither way, the Nigerian banks that have signed up think it will be a worthwhile adventure.\n\nNvalaye Kourouma, Chief Digital Officer at Ecobank, describes the initiative as \u201ca major step in building a framework for a productive engagement with startups and other key stakeholders to make this a success.\u201d\n\nFor VFD Group, it provides an opportunity to accelerate their vision of reaching the last mile with practical and empowering solutions, according to Gbenga Omolokun, the company\u2019s Executive Director for Group Risk, Compliance and Technology.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Gebeya\u2019s matching algorithm considers location, language, and budget when matching businesses with talents.\n\nThis way, businesses of all sizes can access the services they need without being restricted by their budget or location. Companies can also hire a core team if they like.\n\nWhile most people would argue that there is a shortage of technical talent in Africa, Amadou Daffe, CEO and Co-founder of Gebeya, seems to disagree.\n\n\u201cAfrica doesn\u2019t have a talent deficiency, it has a matching problem, and that is what Gebeya is seeking to address through the deployment of a true Pan-African marketplace.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by freelance marketplace, Upwork, 59 million Americans performed freelance work and contributed $1.2 trillion to the American economy. Contrastingly, there is no reliable data on the number of freelance workers in Africa or their contribution to the economy.\n\nGebeya plans to help more businesses hire more freelancers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for businesses to leverage the sharp skills and fresh perspective that freelancers infuse into a permanent workforce,\u201d Daffe added.\n\nSeveral startups have sprung up in Africa to meet the continent\u2019s demand for talent, with Andela, Decagon, and Gebeya leading the charge. Their involvement is all the more critical given projections that Africa\u2019s youth population will cross the one billion mark by 2050 and governments and schools failing to provide them with the skills or jobs they need.\n\nAdvertisement",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenya-based foodtech startup, has announced raising $1 million in pre-seed funding. This raise was led by pan-African early-stage VC, Launch Africa Ventures. Consonance Investments, Liechtenstein-based investment company, Century Oak Capital GmbH, and Pariti, an ecosystem management firm also invested in this round.\n\nFounded in December 2020 by France-born Robin Reecht, Kune\u2019s objective is to provide ready-to-eat food services at a moderate price.\n\nReecht revealed, per TechCrunch, that when he moved to Kenya in 2020, he found it difficult to get affordable and well-cooked food anywhere other than Uber Eats, Jumia, or Glovo with foods that go for $10. The alternative \u2014 cheap roadside food \u2014 didn\u2019t taste as good.\n\nHe took it upon himself to proffer a sustainable solution to bridge the gap between great food and affordable pricing. The following month, he started Kune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReecht tested for product/market fit by creating a trial in a week, from which he got 50 excited customers who had probably been waiting for such a solution. After the trial, his customer base grew to 150 people, and the startup sold over 500 meals.\n\nFood prices cost as little as $4, and Kune raised $50,000 from customers to sustain operations.\n\nBusiness was so good that the startup\u2019s small team struggled to meet their orders. Consequently, the quality of service dropped, and the company decided to retreat and take a break.\n\nIt turned out to be a time to rethink their strategy, as Kune resumed operations with more hires. The company began building a factory with the capacity to cook and package 5,000 meals daily. Kune was ready to raise, and investors took notice.\n\nTwo months later, with a million-dollar check in hand, Kune is one of the first non-fintech startups in the African tech ecosystem to raise a seven-figure pre-seed.\n\nThis funding will be used to internalise all production and human resources capacities, including hiring more team members, completing the factory building, and launching officially in August.\n\nLaunch Africa\u2019s Director of Operation, Baljinder Sharma, believes that having complete autonomy over their supply chain will provide massive growth and scaling opportunity for the startup; hence plans include owning a fleet of 100 electric motorcycles and hiring 100 female riders by 2022.\n\nReetch also revealed plans to create a food media company where Kenyans will be kept up-to-speed with the global food scene and export African foods to Europe and the US by creating weight-reduction, retail, and microwaveable meal offerings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe aim is to be the go-to for quality, freshly-made and affordable ready-to-eat meal delivery service and be a number one culinary major. With Kune anticipating a fast growth rate, we just might have more founders looking into Africa\u2019s foodtech space.",

          "text": "South African animation studio, Triggerfish, in collaboration with other reputable studios like Walt Disney, is set to produce a ten-part African-themed sci-fi series, which will be a feature-length animation film. Titled Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire, the Disney original movie is set to be released on Disney+ in 2022.\n\nAccording to the announcement, each part of the animated anthology will be a ten-minute short film based on stories written by African creators from Zimbabwe, Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Egypt. When released, the curated movie will be another African animation project that Walt Disney is involved with.\n\nIn December 2020, the company hinted at a collaboration with a pan-African entertainment entity, Kugali Media, to produce an animation set in Lagos, Nigeria. The movie, based on the adaptation of a comic book titled, Iw\u00e1j\u00fa, is also planned to be released on DIsney+ next year.\n\nFor the Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire project, Triggerfish, brings renowned directors and creators on board. The executive producer, Peter Ramsey, is also the director of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse.\n\nIn an official statement, Ramsey pointed out that \u201cThe films in the anthology kind of run the gamut when it comes to science fiction. There are stories that touch on other worlds, time travel, and alien beings, but all of these genre conventions are seen through an African lens that makes them totally new.\u201d\n\nThe ten stories adapted for the series were selected after 15 projects were shortlisted and mentored from a stream of pitches received from several African creators.\n\nThe ten films include Stardust, Mkhuzi: The Masked Racer, Hatima, Enkai, Surf Sangoma, Moremi, Mukudzei (Adventures of Muku), First Totem Problems, Henderboy, and You Give Me Heart. These stories are based on themes ranging from fantasy, mythology, sci-fi, and politics.\n\nCreators behind the series include Ahmed Teilab (Egypt), Simangaliso \u2018Panda\u2019 Sibaya and Malcolm Wope (South Africa), Terence Maluleke and Isaac Mogajane (South Africa), Ng\u2019endo Mukii (Kenya), Shofela Coker (Nigeria), Nthato Mokgata and Terence Neale (South Africa), Pious Nyenyewa and Tafadzwa Hove (Zimbabwe), Tshepo Moche (South Africa), Raymond Malinga (Uganda) and Lesego Vorster (South Africa).\n\nApparently, the African animation industry has continued to be taken seriously, considering the growing interest from global animation studios like Disney.\n\nIt is also necessary to acknowledge other factors contributing to this: an increase in self-taught talents and indigenous animation studios daring to take on and execute projects \u2014 a notable mention is Nigeria\u2019s first feature-length animated movie, Lady Buckit and the Motley Mopsters (LBMM).",

          "title": "Airfares may crash in summer as Boeing Max 8 returns, COVID-19 fears hover",
          "text": "Nigerians travelling to various countries for summer holidays this year may be paying less for airfare as airlines deploy more aircraft to various destinations with the return of Boeing Max 8. This will increase capacity of airlines than it was during the grounding of the aircraft type in 2019.\n\nIn addition, airlines are not seeing as much traffic for summer as they used to because of COVID-19, making them introduce incentives to attract passengers to fly again, one of which is low airfares on frequently visited destinations.\n\nThe Boeing Max 8 aircraft was grounded worldwide on March 13, 2019, after two crashes, one in Indonesia in 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in 2019, killing 346 people.\n\nApart from the human tragedy, it was a huge blow to Boeing\u2019s business, since the company had thousands of 737 Max orders on its books. In addition to the flight control system at the centre of both investigations, other reports identified concerns with the airliner\u2019s flight control computer, wiring and engines.\n\nAirlines are now slowly adding the 737 Max back into their schedules. Southwest was the latest carrier to do so when it resumed flights March 11. The plane is now back in service with all US carriers and more carriers are expected to resume usage of the aircraft.\n\nAfter the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in November 2020 cleared the Boeing 737 Max to return to service, other regulators \u2013 notably those in Brazil, Canada, Europe and the UK \u2013 have done likewise.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa disrupts airline business with cheap airfares\n\nIn all, 13 carriers are now flying the 737 Max on commercial services. Cirium flight tracking data show that on March 5, operators carried out 280 revenue flights using the Max and that the in-service fleet had passed 100 aircraft.\n\nDestinations where carriers have resumed usage of these aircraft and are currently flying to are destinations where Nigerians frequently visit, some of which are US, Canada and Paris. Airfares in and to these destinations are expected to crash.\n\nSusan Akporiaye, national president, National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), states that globally, there are many aircraft on ground, especially with the return of Boeing Max 8, but a lot of passengers may not be willing to fly the aircraft, while others may be apprehensive of travelling as a result of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAirlines are not having as much volume as they would have had. As a result, airlines are not increasing fares for summer. If there was no COVID-19, the impact of the return of Boeing Max 8 would have been appreciated but a lot of people are still afraid to fly because of COVID-19,\u201d Akporiaye says.\n\nShe acknowledges that ticket sales may be higher for July, which is summer as students are returning home, but traffic will still be low compared to the year 2019.\n\nShe says the thought of spending so much money on four to five COVID-19 tests for a return flight has continued to discourage passengers from travelling, noting that once the UK government relaxes the travel restrictions, there should be an increase in bookings to London.\n\nAlready, an economy class return ticket from London to Nigeria, which costs between N500,000 and N700,000 during summer now cost between N300,000 and N350,000.\n\nWorld airlines had earlier announced full-year global passenger traffic results for 2020 showing that demand fell by 65.9 percent compared with the full year of 2019, by far the sharpest traffic decline in aviation history.\n\nThe airlines, under the aegis of International Air Transport Association (IATA), show that the sector has shown little signs of recovery with December 2020 total traffic put at 69.7 percent below the same month in 2019 \u2013 little improved from the 70.4 percent contraction in November. Capacity was down 56.7 percent and load factor fell 24.6 percentage points to 57.5 percent.\n\nBookings for future travel made in January 2021 were down 70 percent compared to a year ago, putting further pressure on airline cash positions and potentially impacting the timing of the expected recovery.\n\nIkechi Uko, aviation analyst, says there are fewer passengers for summer with available aircraft, noting that some airlines are pulling some of their aircraft out from service since passengers are not available.\n\nUko notes that the number of annual tourists\u2019 visitation to Dubai reduced from 16 million in 2019 to 5 million in year 2020 as a result of COVID-19.\n\nDubai has stopped flights to certain destinations as a result of COVID-19, Uko states, adding that airlines that are operating may need to introduce incentives to lure passengers to travel again.\n\nTravel may soon gain momentum, especially in countries with high-vaccination rates. These countries include UAE, Seychelles, Malta, San Marino, Bermuda, Israel, Jersey, Guernsey Mongolia, Chile, Isle of Man, UK, Anguilla and Cura\u00e7ao, among others.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has restated that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is not living up to its responsibility of ensuring infrastructural development in the Niger Delta and raising the standard of living of the people.\n\nObaseki said this on Thursday when he received the Odiowere and elders of Ugha Quarters of Urhonigbe Town in Orhionmwon Local Government Area, who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, represented by his Chief of Staff, Hon. Osaigbovo Iyoha, reassured that his government will sustain ongoing infrastructure projects across the state to boost economic activities and improve the lives of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are aware and know that the road has been awarded by NDDC. We make sure that we don\u2019t duplicate efforts. NDDC has not been forthcoming with contracts that have been awarded at that level.\n\n\u201cIn a normal system, if the NDDC has lived up to their responsibility and done the right thing, the government will not need to do the same project. We don\u2019t duplicate work; it amounts to a waste of funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cNDDC left the road in a worse shape than it was before the construction started.

We want to reinstate that as a forum we are committed to it\u2019s implementation as agreed with all\n\n\u201cWe also took report from the National Chairman of the Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Mai Mala Buni, Governor of Yobe State and we commended the Caretaker Committee under his able leadrship for all the successes recorded by the party, particularly that on daily bases people are joining the party.\n\n\u201cEven in the last few months, we had former Gov Gbenga Daniel, the governors of Ebonyi and Cross River States, former Speaker, members of the National and State Assemblies, many illustrious citizens of Nigeria and we are still counting.\n\n\u201cThis is a testament to the fact that APC is Nigeria\u2019s preferred party. It is the party Nigerians will continue to aspire to and continue to be proud of.\n\nREAD ALSO: There\u2019s Still A Lot Of Work To Be Done, Buhari Tells Nigerian Troops In Borno\n\n\u201cWe also appreciate the successes recorded despite constraints of limited economy.\n\nWe equally discussed the time table for our congresses and we reivewed the security situation and acknowledged some of the challenges as well as the successes achieved,\n\nacknowledging constraints of the economy and successes that are being achieved.\u201d\n\nAlhaji Bagudu also stated that President Buhari\u2019s recent visit Lagos to commission the Lagos/Ibadan railway, the Deep Sea Project and other items provided by Lagos State Governor to enhance the security of Lagos State is a pointer to the hard work of the party and the forum.\n\n\u201cJust yesterday, (Tuesday) Mr. President also commissioned the backbone of the 7th Strand of the NLNG. We believe these are among many other legacy projects that will continue to bring more income for the country.\n\n\u201cWe considered the timetable and we have made some inputs particularly to comply with the Electoral Law and the party\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cRemember, we, (PGF) are just one organ of the party (though a very important organ) but we advised the Caretaker Committee to ensure that they consult with all, so that at the end of the day, the final output will be such that all party members will be happy.\n\n\u201cThere is a proposal before Mr. President and once he approves it, the National Caretaker Committee will announce the date,\u201d Bagudu stated.",

We have catered for the youths, women and many demographic considerations in our implementation strategies.\n\n\u201cAs a stop gap intervention, we launched the Agric for Food and Jobs Programme originally conceived as an input loan for smallholder farmers across several commodities including maize, rice, cotton, groundnut, sorghum, cowpea, soybean, sesame, cassava and oil \u2013 palm.\n\n\u201cThe scheme was brought into a partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria, Commodity Association and Agricultural Platform Companies for effective facilitation.\n\n\u201cThis we believe will not only improve production significantly but also aid in the off-taking of produce while providing input at reduced price due to economy of scale.\n\nNanono said that the challenges brought by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, floods and insecurity had galvanized the government into setting up necessary structure to address infrastructural deficiency, technology gaps, security challenges and extension inadequacy.\n\n\u201cThis approach is believed to be the right one for achieving our desired economic diversification and national development,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nKenneth Kaunda, Zambia\u2019s founding president, who was not ashamed to weep in public, has died.\n\nThe man who led his country for 27 years and championed Africa\u2019s struggles against apartheid and HIV/AIDS, died at the age of 97.\n\n\u201cKK\u201d, as he was popularly known, was being treated for pneumonia at the Maina Soko Medical Centre, a military hospital in Lusaka.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the entire nation and on my own behalf, I pray that the entire Kaunda family is comforted as we mourn our first president and true African icon,\u201d President Edgar Lungu said in a message on his Facebook page.\n\nAuthorities declared 21 days of mourning for the liberation hero who ruled from 1964, after the southern African nation won its independence from Britain, until 1991.\n\nAlthough Zambia\u2019s copper-based economy fared badly under his long stewardship, Kaunda will be remembered more for his role as an anti-colonial fighter who stood up to white minority-ruled South Africa.\n\nHe shared a loss experienced by countless families in Africa when his son Masuzyo died of AIDS in 1986, and he began a personal crusade against the disease.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest challenge for Africa. We must fight AIDS and we must do so now,\u201d he told Reuters in 2002.\n\n\u201cWe fought colonialism. We must now use the same zeal to fight AIDS, which threatens to wipe out Africa.\u201d\n\nAs leader of the first country in the region to break with its European colonisers, Kaunda worked hard to drag other former colonies along in Zambia\u2019s wake towards majority rule.\n\nIn 1991, he was forced to hold the first multi-party elections for 23 years, which he lost to long-time foe, trade unionist Frederick Chiluba.\n\nThough he was widely admired as a warm and emotional man, the voters judged he had overstayed his welcome in office and mismanaged the economy.\n\nTHE UNEXPECTED ONE\n\nKenneth David Kaunda was born on April 28, 1924, the youngest of eight children of a Church of Scotland minister at Lubwa mission in the remote north of the country.\n\nKnown also by his African name of \u201cBuchizya\u201d \u2013 the unexpected one \u2013 he did menial jobs to earn school fees after his father\u2019s death.\n\nHe worked as a teacher and a mine welfare officer and entered politics in 1949 as a founder member of the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress.\n\nIn his early days of anti-colonial agitation, he cycled from village to village preaching majority rule.\n\nA 1963 landslide victory for UNIP, which had broken away from the ANC five years earlier, led to Kaunda becoming prime minister of Northern Rhodesia. At independence in 1964, he became president of the new Zambia.\n\nBy the time he lost power, Kaunda\u2019s popularity had slumped and hardship gripped most of his 11 million people as the price of copper, the country\u2019s main export, plummeted.\n\nAfter 27 years of lecturing fellow Africans on how to build an independent nation, he was confronted by misery in his own backyard and anger among his usually easy-going people.\n\nA June 1990 doubling in the price of maize meal, the staple food for most Zambians, sparked a three-day riot in which 27 people were killed, 150 injured and hundreds arrested as the army moved in.\n\nThe same month, an army lieutenant forced his way into a state radio studio and announced that Kaunda had been overthrown, sending people rushing into the streets of Lusaka cheering.\n\nThe coup turned out to be a fiction and the lieutenant was arrested, but the public reaction had shown how low Kaunda\u2019s popularity had sunk.\n\nWEEP IN PUBLIC\n\nKaunda was not ashamed to weep in public and had a unique speaking style, emphasising key thoughts by repeating whole sentences, his trademark white handkerchief in his left hand.\n\nHe espoused an ideology of \u201chumanism\u201d mixing Christian ethics, traditional African values and socialistic principles.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Kaunda was a high-profile figure among the seven southern African states which led the fight against apartheid, and he let Nelson Mandela\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) make a home-in-exile in Lusaka during the three decades it was banned in South Africa.\n\nKaunda also played a major role in Mozambique\u2019s independence talks in 1975, Zimbabwe\u2019s in 1980 and Namibia\u2019s in 1990.\n\nDespite accusations of corruption against his UNIP party, he won credit for bending with the winds of political change and preferring peaceful transition to violent confrontation.\n\nHe was philosophical about his defeat in 1991.\n\nUrging unity and peace, he said in a broadcast: \u201cThose who go into opposition are still an active catalyst for good government, indeed an integral part of good government.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, Kaunda tried to make a political comeback, but he was blocked when Chiluba forced through constitutional amendments which declared the former \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d a foreigner because his parents came from Malawi.\n\nHe was arrested in December 1997 and charged with treason following a coup attempt by junior army officers two months earlier.\n\nHe was detained in a maximum security prison but later placed under house arrest until the state dropped the charges.\n\nAfter his son and political heir Wezi Kaunda was murdered in October 1999, Kaunda announced his withdrawal from domestic politics to concentrate on halting the spread of AIDS through his Kenneth Kaunda Children of Africa Foundation.\n\nApart from Masuzyo and Wezi, Kaunda and his wife Betty had six other children \u2013 four boys and two girls.\n\nIn his later years he led a quiet life, mostly staying at home and only occasionally appearing at state functions.\n\nIn a rare public appearance in September 2019, at the age of 95, he spoke out strongly against a wave of attacks in South Africa against foreigners from other African countries.\n\n\u201cOur brothers and sisters in South Africa should remember that these same people they are treating with cruelty are the same people who were comrades in arms in fighting the brutal apartheid regime,\u201d Kaunda said.",

Some of the legislators who claimed to lack the required financial deposits were also assisted to access loans by the CBN governor.\u201d\n\nOther sources listed infractions involving the CBN governor and his role in diverting the traditional agricultural insurance responsibility of the government insurance company to private companies in which his family members have an interest.\n\n\u201cThe 9th Assembly of National Assembly under Senator Ahmad Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila can better be described as a compromised and silenced legislative arm of government under the current dispensation. No thanks to free access to contracts, cash, and patronage from strategic revenue-generating agencies under the legislative supervisory power of the legislators.\n\n\u201cThe legislators and their principal officers have graduated from constituency project implementation to allocation of slots in employment, where the current Minister of Humanitarian Affairs also settled them with N-Power and conditional Cash Transfer slots contrary to principles guiding the projects,\u201d another source stated.\n\n.",

Hundreds took to the streets to demonstrate in support of his arrival. Police fired teargas in other neighbourhoods to disperse similar crowds.\n\nOne group chanted, \u201cGbagbo is coming. We will install him,\u201d while others shouted, \u201cRespect the power of Gbagbo,\u201d from mini-vans heading towards the airport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for me to go and welcome Gbagbo,\u201d said Liliane Kokora, who wore a t-shirt with Gbagbo\u2019s face printed on it. \u201cHe is finally arriving in his country to give us hope.\u201d\n\nMr Gbagbo, who came to office in 2000, was arrested after a brief civil war prompted by his refusal to concede defeat to Mr Ouattara in the 2010 election.\n\nMore than 3,000 people were killed in the conflict, which was fought largely along ethnic and regional lines.\n\nHe was acquitted in 2019 of war crimes and crimes against humanity charges by the International Criminal Court for his role in the violence.\n\nAt least 85 people died in the unrest surrounding the bitterly contested October 2020 presidential election, in which Mr Ouattara won a third term.\n\nMr Gbagbo\u2019s return comes after protracted negotiations between his camp and the government, which delayed granting him a passport until after the 2020 election had passed.\n\nAfter Mr Gbagbo announced the date of his return, the government initially complained that it had not been consulted but later said he would be welcomed back in the interest of national reconciliation.\n\nMr Gbagbo, 76, faces an outstanding 20-year prison sentence handed down in November 2019 on charges he misappropriated funds from the regional central bank.\n\nAt the airport in Brussels, a small group of Mr Gbango\u2019s supporters from Paris waited to see him off. Some wore T-shirts bearing his effigy, including one with text reading \u201cGbagbo the Unavoidable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would an individual seek to return to their country? Because it is his country.

          "text": "Kaunda, who ruled Zambia from 1964 to 1991, died at a hospital in Lusaka where he was being treated for pneumonia.\n\nKenneth Kaunda, Zambia\u2019s founding president and liberation hero, has died at a military hospital in Lusaka where he was being treated for pneumonia, his son, Kambarage, said on Thursday. He was 97.\n\nKaunda ruled Zambia from 1964, when the southern African nation won its independence from Britain, until 1991, and afterwards become one of Africa\u2019s most committed activists against HIV/AIDS.\n\n\u201cI am sad to inform (members) we have lost Mzee (the old man). Let\u2019s pray for him,\u201d Kambarage said on the late president\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nThe former president had been feeling unwell and had been admitted to the Maina Soko Medical Centre in Lusaka earlier this week.\n\nAlthough Zambia\u2019s copper-based economy fared badly under his long stewardship, Kaunda will be remembered more for his role as an anti-colonial fighter who stood up to white minority-rule in southern African countries such as Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.\n\nHe shared a loss experienced by countless families in Africa when his son Masuzyo died of AIDS in 1986, and he began a personal crusade against the disease.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest challenge for Africa. We must fight AIDS and we must do so now,\u201d he told Reuters news agency in 2002.\n\n\u201cWe fought colonialism. We must now use the same zeal to fight AIDS, which threatens to wipe out Africa.\u201d\n\nThe youngest of eight children, Kaunda\u2019s father died when he was eight years old. His mother was a teacher \u2013 a rare profession for Zambian women in those days.\n\nHe started his political career as organising secretary of the Northern Rhodesia African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Province of Zambia.\n\nBut in 1958 he broke from the ANC to form the Zambian African National Congress (ZANC). The colonial authorities banned it a year later, and Kaunda was imprisoned in the capital Lusaka for nine months.\n\nZANC became the United Party for National Development (UNIP) in 1959.\n\nThe following year Kaunda was released from prison and elected president of UNIP. He then stared organising civil disobedience known as the Cha-cha-cha campaign.\n\nIt was the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi that made Kaunda become committed to non-violent principles.\n\nUsing his rhetorical skills to appeal to the public, Kaunda won independence for his nation without resorting to violence in 1964. As UNIP president, he ruled Zambia for 27 years.\n\nKaunda\u2019s legacy\n\nIn foreign policy, Kaunda provided logistical help to other African liberation movements, including the Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union (ZAPU) and the breakaway Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) of Southern Rhodesia and the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa.\n\nThe ANC\u2019s Radio Freedom was allowed to broadcast from the capital Lusaka and it was under Kaunda\u2019s protection that the ANC waged an armed struggle, then a diplomatic one against apartheid.\n\nZambia also helped Zimbabwe gain its independence from white minority rule in 1980.\n\nBut during his time in power, Zambia became a one-party state \u2013 effectively giving him absolute control.\n\nKaunda banned the political opposition in 1973. He was forced to reverse this decision in 1991 due to popular pressure provoked by shortages of basic foodstuffs as well as increasing international pressure for greater democracy in Africa.\n\nHe fell from power with the advent of multi-party democracy. In 1991, he lost presidential elections to Fredrick Chiluba from the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) after a fiercely-contested campaign.\n\nKaunda accepted defeat waving his trademark white handkerchief.\n\nKaunda had continued to engage in national politics and in 1996 tried to stand for the presidency. However, the Chiluba government changed the constitution so that anyone whose parents came from outside the country was deemed a foreigner and could therefore not run for office.\n\nChiluba later attempted to deport Kaunda alleging that he was a Malawian. In 1997, Chiluba, threw Kaunda in jail on Christmas Day for allegedly being involved in a foiled coup attempt.\n\nIn 1999, during Chiluba\u2019s rule, he was declared stateless by a Zambian High Court, but he challenged this decision in the Supreme Court of Zambia, which declared him to be Zambian citizen the following year.\n\nThroughout the African continent, many streets, buildings and airports are named after him. And even in old age, he repeatedly raised his voice in public against perceived injustices as well as the oppression of minorities.",

The Minister was accompanied by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbeshola and the Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Eluonye Onyenuchea Irabor as well as representatives of the Service Chiefs.\n\n\u201cDuring the Summit, a whole range of security challenges were discussed with all the Governors of the South East States, religious leaders, traditional rulers, opinion leaders and other stakeholders in attendance. The discussions and decisions reached at the end of the Security Summit were far reaching and would go a long way in tackling and bringing peace to the Region,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the troops of Operation Safe Haven killed some armed bandits, cultists during an operation in Bokkos areas of Plateau State, recovered arms and ammunition, while others escaped with gun shot wounds.\n\n\u201cThese incidents occurred when troops on fighting patrol came in contact and engaged some armed bandits along Bokkos \u2013 Gana Rop Road on 4 June 2021.\n\n\u201cSeveral of them were neutralized during the encounter while others escaped with gunshot wounds. In another encounter, troops on the heels of credible intelligence report, ambushed and arrested some cultists who reportedly belong to a criminal gang that attacks and robs commuters and dispossess\u2019 them of their belongings at Terminus general area of Jos, Plateau State. Similarly, troops on patrol arrested a notorious kidnapper, who has been on the wanted list of security agents, by name Halilu Umaru, who was in possession of assorted arms and ammunition and other dangerous weapons around Mangu Market in Mangu LGA of Plateau State.

          "text": "Igbos in Nigeria Movement, INM, has called on the Chief of Army Staff, Major Gen Farouk Yahaya to reintroduce special operations towards curbing the escalating rate of crime and criminalities experienced in the South-East.\n\nThe group made the call on Wednesday at a press conference comprising of stakeholders from each state in the region.\n\nIn his address titled \u2018The Call for Special Operations in South-East Nigeria by the Nigerian Army,\u2019 the group\u2019s secretary-general, JohnBosco Ike said this is necessary to curtail the worrisome rise in insecurity in the zone by various secessionist agitations.\n\nIke said they can no longer watch in silence as innocent lives are truncated for selfish reasons by a group whose agenda promotes their selfish interest to the detriment of all Igbos in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the urgent intervention of the Nigerian Army is necessary to restore law and order.\n\nThe group recalled the impact of army operations such as Operations Crocodile Smile and Python Dance that successfully addressed security challenges such as kidnappings, ritual killings, and other criminalities in the region.\n\nWhile commending troops for previous interventions, the group vowed to stage a peaceful protest to the National Assembly and the Army headquarters in the full glare of the public if the army fails to rescue its people.\n\n\u201cWe must agree that events in South-East Nigeria are indeed worrisome given the acts of criminality that have gained prominence in recent times. Therefore, as concerned stakeholders in the South-East region, with members representing every state in the region, called this press conference to press home demand for the immediate intervention of the Nigerian Army towards curtailing the declining state of security perpetuated by some groups and individuals whose motives remain suspect and from all indications meant to distort the socio-economic development of the South-East region.\n\n\u201cThe Igbos in Nigeria Movement would not watch in silence as innocent lives are truncated for selfish reasons by a group whose agenda promotes their selfish interest to the detriment of all Igbos in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are worried and therefore left with no option to seek the urgent intervention of the Nigerian Army in the restoration of law and order in the South East region of Nigeria. However, we have consulted widely with our members from wide and far and conclude that there is an urgent need for the intervention of the Nigerian Army through the reintroduction of special operations.\n\n\u201cOur considered opinion is that the reintroduction of special operations as in times past would go a long way in addressing the various secessionist agitations that are being propagated by a group of opportunists who do not mean well for the South East region.\n\n\u201cWe recall the impact of army operations such as Operations Crocodile Smile and Python Dance that successfully addresses security challenges such as kidnappings, ritual killings, and other criminalities in the South East region.\n\n\u201cWe must admit that the success of the various operations cannot be overemphasized, and the relative peace and tranquillity that pervaded the South East region as a result of the intervention was indeed welcomed by critical stakeholders, including the Igbos in Nigeria Movement.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, on the strength of the success of previous operations that the leadership of the Igbos in Nigeria Movement is making this passionate appeal to the leadership of the Nigerian Army to see to the reintroduction of army operations in South-East Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is cognizant that the South East region is presently under siege. Therefore, it will be a great disservice to the peaceful and loving people of the South-East region if the leadership of the Nigerian Army does not introduce once again special operations in these trying times.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the Nigerian Army must also realise that its previous special operations had brought about peace and stability in the region, which the people of the South-East region were appreciative of.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the Nigerian Army cannot feign ignorance of the security challenges in the South East region. Consequently, the leadership of the Nigerian Army cannot state that it can\u2019t make interventions towards addressing the security challenges in the region.\n\n\u201cOur plea is hinged on the necessity to see to the restoration of peace, which would go a long way in the socio-economic well-being of the South-East region. Our faith and belief in the Nigerian Army remain sacrosanct.\n\n\u201cWe desire that in the coming weeks and months, the leadership of the Nigerian Army shall deem it necessary and urgent to see to the reintroduction of special operations to address the security challenges in the South-East region.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we also solicit the support of other critical stakeholders to see to the materialisation of this request in the interest of peace and tranquility,\u201d the statement read in part.",

This is nothing but a shallow attempt at turning the truth on its head.\n\n\u201cNACW appeals to the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to whom Jafaru Mohammed\u2019s petition was addressed, not to lend his office out for shielding persons of interest in corruption probes from being investigated.\n\n\u201cWe expect the Minister of Justice and Nigerians at large to note that the kind of blackmail contained in the said petition is a staple of those that once looted this country to the point of bankruptcy. While not advocating for the rights and freedom of citizens to be arbitrarily abridged, it is pertinent to also insist that those found to have been tainted with corruption in the course of serving the country are properly investigated and tried when indicted.\n\n\u201cNigerians must not forget too soon that the industrial-scale looting of the money meant for purchasing arms and military hardware under the National Security Adviser, whom Jafaru Mohammed served, was responsible in large part for the security challenges facing the country today. It is therefore a travesty that the person who held the purse while our commonwealth was looted can now be alleging witch-hunt and vendetta.\n\n\u201cNACW, therefore, calls on the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami to allow the investigation of Brigadier General Jafaru Mohammed to continue without distractions as this is what his petition amounts to.\n\n\u201cNigeria wants Malami to allow EFCC to function without Interference as this is the only approach that will enable to the country rout corruption, which has remained the greatest problem facing the country. Rather than hampering investigation into the activities of the Director of Finance and Administration in the Office of the National Security Adviser, Attorney-General should rather prevail on Jafaru Mohammed to cooperate with investigators so that he can speed up his appearance in court if indicted.\n\n\u201cNACW consequently puts the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice on notice that we would be closely watching the handling of Jafaru Mohammed\u2019s petition to ensure that is it not used as smokescreen for eroding the independence of EFCC and cripple its ability to thoroughly investigate corruption. If Nigerians can establish interference on the part of the AGF, NACW will recourse to all available legal means to ensure that such unacceptable behaviour is halted before it does damage the credibility of the anti-corruption agency.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has urged the military and other security agents not to give breathing space to terrorists and criminals in the country.\n\nThe President gave the charge on Thursday while addressing personnel of the Armed Forces and security agencies in Operation Hadin Kai at the Maimalari Cantonment during a visit to Borno State.\n\nHe said the war against insurgency must be concluded with the restoration of peace and reconstruction of all the affected areas.\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging your collective efforts at decimating and degrading the terrorists and reaffirming the inviolable sovereignty of our nation, I also wish to extol your steadfastness and untiring efforts in the face of the difficulties you experience in the Theatres of Operation.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow our adversaries the opportunity or breathing space to challenge or undermine our national interests and core values. The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gunmen Kill Five Security Personnel In Zamfara\n\n\u201cYour collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today. Under my watch, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have been provided a firm strategy and clear sense of direction to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari also said the nation owes a debt of gratitude to military men and women, and security agencies currently tackling security challenges in the country, particularly the many who paid the supreme price.\n\nHe assured that the government will continue to support all the loved ones.\n\n\u201d I want to seize this opportunity to put it on record that our nation will forever be indebted to you, for your patriotic commitment to the defence of our fatherland against insurgency and criminality.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, commend you and remember all the personnel who have paid the supreme sacrifice in ensuring that Nigeria remains an indivisible and secure entity.\n\n\u201cAs I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, I want to assure you that my administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country are well cared for,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said wounded comrades will get the best medical attention towards their full recovery and commended the military and security agencies for the synergy that translated into successes in restoring peace and order.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note the increasing understanding and cooperation within the military, as well as the inter-agency cooperation in the fight against the terrorists and other criminal elements in the North East.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this synergy is evidenced by the successes recorded in the ongoing Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO which has so far degraded the insurgents\u2019 capabilities in the Timbuktu Triangle, Sambisa Forest and the Lake Chad Region. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies \u201cjointness, synergy and cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy pooling together the collective resources and comparative advantages of the Armed Forces and other security agencies, we hope the enemy will now feel the ferocity of our firepower and the weight of our resolve,\u201d the President said.\n\nBuhari also assured that his administration is developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building.\n\n\u201cConcerted efforts are being made to fast-track reconstruction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that this will lead to the speedy resettlement of displaced persons, as well as the restoration of bubbling community life as people return to their homes.\n\n\u201cAlongside investment in development and reconstruction, we will sustain our investment in the Armed Forces in a manner that balances the carrot and stick,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said several interventions by the Federal Government had led to the procurement and delivery of large consignments of critical combat enablers, including high calibre weapons and ammunition.\n\n\u201cMany have been injected into the Theatre and soon other equipment that have just arrived in the country would also be deployed to the Theatre of operations. Much more equipment will be procured for the Armed Forces to cater for both the short and long-term requirements.\n\n\u201cI would like, at this point, to also commend the hierarchy of our Armed Forces for their strategic foresight in ensuring that some of our critical military equipment are fabricated locally.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj Gen. Felix Omoigui, assured troops of the President\u2019s confidence and commitment to their welfare, especially in bringing the war to a conclusive end.\n\nThe Commander thanked the President for the visit to the troops, which he said will greatly boost the morale of all those fighting to keep the country in peace.\n\nGovernors of Borno and Yobe State, Babagana Zulum and Mai Bunu respectively, Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor, Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen Farouk Yahaya, Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo, Chief of Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao and National Security Adviser, Maj Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), were also at the event.",

          "text": "Inflation is surging worldwide, making markets nervous that it could derail a post-pandemic economic recovery by putting pressure on central banks to consider pulling stimulus measures sooner than planned.\n\n\u2013 Why is inflation rising? \u2013\n\nCentral bankers say the inflationary pressure is temporary and due to the low base of comparison to a big drop in prices during the first year of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nOil prices have returned the pre-pandemic levels while the economic recoveries in the US and China have led to growing demand in commodities.\n\nThere have been shortages in a variety of goods.\n\n\u201cThe rise in inflation so far has largely reflected a combination of a rebound in commodity prices and what we have termed \u2018reopening\u2019 inflation -\u2013 that is to say, a rebound in prices caused by the unwinding of pandemic-era distortions,\u201d said Neil Shearing, analyst at Capital Economics.\n\nThe consumer price index in the United States hit five percent in May, the highest rate in 13 years.\n\nBritish inflation soared to its highest level since before the pandemic last month, with clothing, fuel and oil prices rebounding as the economy reopens.\n\nGermany\u2019s inflation also jumped in May to its highest level in a decade, mainly driven by surging energy prices.\n\nIn China, the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the cost of goods at the factory gate rose to its highest rate in over a decade last month, though consumer prices were stable.\n\nEmerging countries with chronic inflation such as Nigeria and Turkey have seen double-digit increases.\n\n\u2013 How is it affecting economies? \u2013\n\nThe effect is being felt around the world.\n\nHigh inflation driven by soaring food prices has pushed seven million Nigerians into poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn the United States, the price of pork is 51 percent higher than a year ago.\n\nNew home construction in the US has been affected by shortages of material and the high price of lumber.\n\nThe rising prices of metals have been a problem for automakers.\n\nChina announced Thursday that it was going to tap its national reserves of copper, aluminium and zinc to curb commodity prices.\n\n\u2013 How long will it last? \u2013\n\nIs it a temporary issue or a long-term problem?\n\n\u201cThe risk that the initial spike in inflation would trigger second round effects leading to inflation staying high for longer seems low,\u201d said William de Vijlder, chief economist at BNP Paribas, in a note last month.\n\nDe Vijlder said labour market slack \u2014 or unmet demand for paid labour \u2014 and competitive pressure will prevent long-term price increases.\n\nBut Susannah Streeter, analyst at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said \u201cthe shortage of staff in key industries could also put a rocket under wage inflation which could linger for a lot longer\u201d.\n\n\u2013 What are central banks saying? \u2013\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s huge stimulus programme has fuelled a massive recovery but bond yields have risen as markets predict that the US Federal Reserve will act to stop the economy from overheating earlier than planned.\n\nTop Fed officials on Wednesday maintained their ultra-easy monetary policy and repeated their belief that the temporary sharp spikes in inflation were expected as businesses reopen and people return to their daily lives.\n\nBut they brought forward their timeline for a possible rise in interest rates, with a majority of central bank policymakers expecting at least two rate hikes by the end of 2023, a year sooner than in their previous outlook.\n\nYields rose in Europe, too, putting pressure on the European Central Bank.\n\nAnalysts say a tightening of central bank policy could derail the post-Covid recovery.\n\n\u201cThat would result in higher rates of interest on home loans and credit cards and there are concerns it could dampen consumer demand too quickly and set back the overall economic recovery,\u201d Streeter said.\n\n\u201cCompanies which need to borrow money to expand may be put off from that course of action if interest rates increase too rapidly, which could drag on economic growth.\u201d\n\nECB chief Christine Lagarde said just last week that it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to consider winding down pandemic support.\n\nBut central banks in Iceland, Brazil and Russia have already raised their rates to counter inflation.\n\nAFP",
