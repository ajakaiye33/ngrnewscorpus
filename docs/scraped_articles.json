          "text": "Oluwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nAn official at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Dr. Tochi Okwor, has urged healthcare workers to put hand hygiene at the top of their must-do list, noting that it is crucial to preventing infections in hospitals.\n\nDr. Okwor, who is the Antimicrobial Resistant and Infection and Control Programme coordinator at NCDC, noted that hand hygiene is one of the best investments we can make in healthcare.\n\nShe said this in a virtual session held on Twitter by The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control in collaboration with DRASA Health Trust, a non-profit organisation.\n\nThis session was held in commemoration of the 2022 World Hand Hygiene Day, themed, United for Safety: Clean your hands.\n\nOkwor further explained that hands can move infection from one place to another, stressing that hygiene is the most important measure to prevent infection.\n\nHand hygiene, she said, is often called the cornerstone of infection prevention.\n\n\u201cNormally, patients come to hospitals and expect that they get better and go home from whatever ails them, but the hands that are supposed to bring comfort and healing can also become vehicles of death if they take diseases, germs, microorganisms that can cause severe diseases and introduce them to parts of our patient where it can result in severe infection,\u201d the NCDC official said.\n\nShe further stressed that keeping our hands safe is truly fundamental.\n\n\u201cThe hands can move microorganisms, bacteria that cause infection from one part of the hospital, from one part of the patient to a part of the patient where it can cause infection,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, the World Health Organisation has identified what they call the five moments for hand hygiene.\n\n\u201cThose five moments have been found that if we as health workers can render our hands safe and free of disease-causing microorganisms, then we would be very successful in reducing healthcare-associated infections. Those infections that patients didn\u2019t have before they came to the hospital but then acquired when they came to the hospital care.\n\n\u201cJust as the hands are central in bringing healing, the hands are also central in transmitting infection,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking at the virtual session, a Nigerian professor of medical microbiology, Folasade Ogunsola said, \u201chealthcare provision has become rather complex in the last few decades with teams of professionals working together with technology and various processes.\n\n\u201cSo it is unsurprising that an estimated one in 10 patients is harmed while receiving hospital care in high-income countries and we know that over 134,000,000 adverse events occur in hospitals in lower-middle-income countries such as ours, Nigeria, due to unsafe care that results in about 2.6 million deaths annually.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentially healthcare can be dangerous and we really need to be intentional about making sure patients are not harmed by avoidable incidents,\u201d Ogunsola said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Arthritis\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nHealthcare professionals have called for massive awareness and management of rheumatoid arthritis to prevent disease progression, stating that early diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment improve clinical outcomes for patients with the disease.\n\nThe autoimmune experts who spoke during a virtual media roundtable hosted by Pfizer Biopharmaceutical on the \u2018Prevalence and Social Burden of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Nigeria\u2019 said the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, RA, is ideally done as soon as the patient starts with disease symptoms in order to get the disease into remission or have minimal signs and symptoms.\n\nRA is an autoimmune disorder that affects the small joints of the body. Patients with RA present with pain, stiffness and warmth of the affected joints and the disease may lead to disability or premature death, if not treated early and appropriately.\n\nSharing medical insights on the condition, a Consultant rheumatologist, Dr Hakeem Olaosebikan, at the Lagos State University College of Medicine, explained that early management and treatment would decrease the progression of joint disease as the disease process can cause progressive damage to joints with resultant loss of function, which in many patients, will mean that they are unable to fulfil work obligations or cope with activities at home.\n\nHe said adequate treatment is also important to try to prevent or lessen the severity of co-morbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease, a major cause of mortality in RA patients.\n\n\u201cApart from treating the rheumatoid disease, the patient should ideally be treated by a multidisciplinary team to address many other associations of this disease which range from psychological help with anxiety and depression to guidance with physical therapy by physiotherapists or biokineticists and help with activities of daily living by occupational therapists.\u201d\n\nOlaosebikan said it had become imperative to raise awareness about rheumatology, as well as, enlighten the public about the management of rheumatoid arthritis as the commonest autoimmune arthritis in Nigeria.\n\nHe disclosed that one or two patients are diagnosed weekly with the disease in most tertiary hospitals.\n\nHe said the disease poses physical, psychological, and economic burdens for affected patients, their families and the healthcare system.\n\nOlaosebikan urged the government to focus on the disease, stressing the need to evolve and pass patient-friendly legislatures.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to reduce calorie and salt intake, maintain a healthy weight, avoid smoking and ensure regular exercise to strengthen joint mobility.\n\nSpeaking, a Rheumatologist from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LUTH, Dr. Uyiekpan Ima-Edomwonyi, said data has shown that the burden of rheumatoid arthritis would increase in most developing countries like Nigeria.\n\nHe said along with the increase in non\u2013communicable diseases (NCD) in developing countries, an increase in Rheumatoid arthritis occurrence could stress medical services to an extent that they may be unable to cope with the fast-changing patterns of disease distribution seen in Africa currently.\n\nIma-Edomwonyi said that factors that would drive the disease burden include lifestyle, weight, smoking and alcohol consumption which predisposed to musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nThe Country Medical Director, Pfizer East and West Africa, Dr. Kodjo Soroh, stated that RA remains one of the most common rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in the region.\n\nHe said there was hope as Pfizer is committed to raising awareness around the treatments available.\n\n\u201cWe want to work closely with the healthcare community to ensure early diagnosis, increased patient access and medication adherence. There is Project Afya, a patient assistance program aimed at improving access to life-saving medications and boosting cancer care and autoimmune disease management. In partnership with IQVIA, the platform is helping to reduce therapy costs for eligible patients as Rheumatologists identify patients for enrolment into the programme\u201d.",

          "text": "Consistent with its strategic objective of stakeholder collaboration and partnering, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) recently met a section of stakeholders in the mass media industry.\n\nThe forum was a workshop organised to keep Nigerian journalists who specialise in reporting on the telecom and ICT sector, abreast of emerging developments in the telecom industry, in order to ensure the general public receives contextual, interpretive and illuminating reporting on telecom matters.\n\nThe journalists, who attended the workshop under the aegis of the Nigeria Information Technology Reporters\u2019 Association (NITRA), Abuja Chapter, revelled in the opportunity provided by NCC to glean emerging trends and topical regulatory issues in the telecom industry.\n\nThe workshop was part of NCC\u2019s commitment to encouraging the continuous professional development of journalists because the Commission sees good journalism as central, both to the achievement of its mandate and to the flourishing of our nation\u2019s democratic project.\n\nThe training programme featured intense sessions focused on understanding the renewal the Commission has brought to bear on many major industry issues, including International Termination Rate (ITR) for voice services, benefits of the National Identity Number/Subscriber Identity Module linkage (NIN-SIM integration), the menace of illegal use of GSM boosters, updates on Fifth Generation (5G) deployment plan, spectrum administration, as well as compliance monitoring and enforcement, and other emergent regulatory matters.\n\nSpeaking at the workshop, which also featured special focus group discussions facilitated by subject-matter experts and senior officials of the Commission from selected departments of the Commission, the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, said approval for the training was granted by Management as it is in tandem with the Commission\u2019s media relations and stakeholder engagement strategy.\n\n\u201cGiven the dynamic nature of the digital space and its impact on the economy, we believe this demands that our media partners are brought up to speed with the current requirements for maximum productivity and effective reporting of the telecom industry,\u201d Danbatta, who was represented by the Director, Public Affairs, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde, asserted to justify the relevance of the workshop.\n\nThe EVC said, through capacity-building initiatives such as the workshop organised for professionals in the media industry, \u201cwe would build multually-beneficial relationships for sustained media support as we continue to discharge our mandate of regulating this dynamic sector for the benefit of Nigerians and the economy as a whole.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Danbatta said NITRA is a long-standing strategic partner of the Commission and the knowledge empowerment programme through this workshop seeks to provide a platform for equipping stakeholders in the media with the knowledge and skillsets they require for effective, efficient and professional reporting.\n\nThe EVC, who commended the media stakeholders for their support over the years, said, without the support from journalists and other communication professionals, NCC would not have been able to deliver on its mandate as effectively as it has done over the years. Accordingly, Danbatta enjoined all members of NITRA to continue to support NCC\u2019s programmes, activities, and initiatives with the same enthusiasm with which they have been prioritising timely, adequate and accurate reportage of the nation\u2019s telecom sector to enhance Nigeria\u2019s growth and development.\n\nDanbatta also stated that the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030, the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025, the NCC Strategic Management Plan (SMP) 2020-2024, the creation of a Digital Economy Department in the Commission, among others, underscored the policy directions of the Federal Government which the NCC is diligently driving by working with relevant industry stakeholders, including the media, to deepen commitment to a digital Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, it is expected that by empowering the media as our key stakeholders, they would be willing to ensure that members of public are accurately and adequately informed and are aware of the Commission\u2019s regulatory strides toward building a robust digital economy for our country,\u201d the EVC said.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of members of NITRA after the training, the Chairman NITRA, Abuja Chapter, Blessing Olaifa, commended the Commission for providing a platform for sensitisation of media stakeholders on contemporary matters within the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) ecosystem, particularly the telecom industry and especially the initiatives of the Commission in protecting telecom\u2019s consumers.\n\nOlaifa, who was represented by NITRA\u2019s Secretary-General, Emmanuel Elebeke, applauded the Commission for consistently supporting and partnering with the media organization. Olaifa stated that this demonstrates how transparent and accessible NCC has been to its stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe must commend NCC for its regulatory strides over the years. The success of the 5G auction in December last year easily comes to mind as one of the recent achievements of the Commission, among several others. So, this capacity-building programmes will help to provide a collaborative partnership for an advanced digital economy and towards boosting the fortunes of ICT for development in Nigeria. Today, we have been thoroughly enlightened as better specialists in ICT journalism,\u201d Olaifa said.",

          "title": "NCC flagship public institution impacting lives positively \u2013 Alake of Egbaland",
          "text": "The Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, Okukenu IV, has applauded the regulatory strides of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in ensuring accelerated growth of the telecommunications sector, thus making the sector a flagship enabler of Nigeria\u2019s prosperity.\n\nThe Paramount Ruler gave the commendation when the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management (ECSM) of NCC, Adeleke Adewolu, led a delegation of NCC staff to the state where the maiden edition of the Village Square Dialogue (VSD) was organised by NCC in Abeokuta.\n\nThe VSD, a version of the Telecom Consumer Conversation (a strategic, multistakeholder consumer outreach programme of NCC), took place at the 92-year-old Centenary Hall, adjacent the Alake\u2019s Palace. The VSD is specially conceived by the NCC to interact with telecom consumers at the grassroots for the purpose of sensitising telecom consumers through information sharing, education and advocacy on telecommunications-related issues. Importantly, the forum provides an opportunity for telecom consumers in rural areas to make contributions to the governance process of the telecom ecosystem and to equally engage their service providers to resolve complaints.\n\nOba Gbadebo, who was the Royal Father of the Day at the event, and was represented by Oluwo of Ake, Egbaland, Chief Samuel Tanimowo, said \u201cOne of the public institutions, whose activities are felt by the generality of Nigerians in many positive ways is NCC and the leadership of the Commission must be commended for its doggedness in ensuring that Nigerians enjoy the benefits of digital revolutions.\u201d\n\nThe monarch, who was unequivocal in describing NCC as a flagship public institution positively impacting the lives of all Nigerians, also particularly commended Adewolu, an indigene of the state, for his positive representation of the people of Owu Kingdom, Ogun State, where he hails from. \u201cWe also thank you and your entire Board and Management for bringing the first edition of the Village Square Dialogue to us in Ogun State. This is a testament to how important you take our state, which has contributed tremendously to the socio-economic and political history of Nigeria,\u201d the first-class monarch said.\n\nThe leading monarch\u2019s assertion was underscored by the Iyaloja of Egbaland, Chief Oluwakemi Oloyede, who thanked the NCC for the sensitization programme, which she said, had benefited not only the market women and men who attended the event but also the entire telecom consumers present, who cut across social strata.\n\n\u201cWe have listened to all you have told us as telecom consumers, we would always recall the information when you have left us and we would also ensure that we take all measures possible to join hands in protecting telecom facilities in our vicinities for improved quality of service delivery. From all indications, doing this is for our own benefits as consumers,\u201d Iyaloja Oloyede stated with the conviction of a good listener and leader.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Adewolu, who once served as a Commissioner for Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs in the State, called on the community leaders and people of Ogun State to take ownership of telecommunications infrastructure in their localities and protect them from vandalism or theft.\n\nThe ECSM said Ogun State is central to telecoms growth in Nigeria in that it hosts one of the largest concentrations of users of telecoms services in Nigeria, with an active subscriber base of over eight million users as of the Fourth Quarter of 2021, according to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\n\u201cThis huge subscriber base is supported by a dynamic ecosystem of service providers, dealers, marketers and innovators. We are, therefore, here to host the maiden edition of the NCC-instituted Village Square Dialogue and to salute the legendary entrepreneurial spirit of the people of Ogun State. On behalf of the Commission, I also thank you for the warm reception accorded us and the warmth traditionally accorded telecom service providers to bolster infrastructure development\u201d, Adewolu said.\n\nAddressing the audience further, Adewolu said telecoms services have long been recognised as the easiest and cheapest means of meeting critical socio-economic needs such as education, financial inclusion, economic empowerment and deepening social interactions. Accordingly, Adewolu said the infrastructure through which these services are provided is called the \u201cinfrastructure of infrastructures\u201d because they enable the digitization and seamless connectivity of all other socio-economic sectors.\n\n\u201cWithout telecoms infrastructure, we cannot communicate with friends and family over long distances at the touch of a button, and we cannot conduct banking, insurance, governmental services, education, entertainment and many other activities with ease without telecommunications. This means that telecoms infrastructure are critical to modern existence, and we must all do what we can to ensure that we tackle anything that affects their seamless operation\u201d, Adewolu emphasised.\n\n\u201cIssues like hostile communities, the theft of diesel, batteries and power-generating sets, digging up fiber lines, sealing/locking-up of Base Transceiver Station (BTS) sites and such other illegal activities must be tackled decisively by all of us. I therefore urge you all to please see telecoms infrastructure as your own, and to protect them as communal property. Anybody that tampers with telecoms infrastructure is tampering with your future and the future of your children \u2013 they should be resisted and reported,\u201d the ECSM stated.\n\nAlso at the event, NCC\u2019s Director of Consumer Affairs (DCA), Efosa Idehen, made a presentation elucidating on how NCC protects the interests, rights and privileges of telecom consumers. The DCA emphasized consumer obligations, especially in the area of telecoms infrastructure protection in order to ensure improved quality of service (QoS) and better quality of experience (QoE).\n\nSimilarly, a Principal Manager in the Technical Standards and Network Integrity (TSNI) Department of NCC, Kunle Olorundare, spoke on the contributions of telecoms to the economy, mobile network development, the benefits of telecoms, network outages and their causes, and he enjoined consumers to protect telecoms infrastructure.\n\n\u201cBy protecting the infrastructure, you are protecting every service offered on the network. You are protecting your money (Mobile Banking), your Jobs (Recharge Card and Phone business), your children\u2019s future (Learning on the internet) and even your community (Social communication),\u201d Olorundare said to restate the centrality of telecommunications to individuals and businesses.\n\nThe event was oversubscribed as the venue was filled to the brim with traditional rulers and other community leaders, market women and men, other telecom consumers from all walks of life, and representatives of telecoms consumers and service providers. Also, more than 90 per cent of the forum\u2019s communication was conducted in the Yoruba language which is spoken and understood by the majority of the people in the environment, and also in Pidgin English. This choice of languages used at the forum enhanced comprehension and participation at the event, and also bolstered the appreciation of the important role NCC plays in promoting the consolidation of the growth of the telecom industry.",

          "text": "Former national chairman of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) Senator Victor Umeh has warned that any Southeast Governor or politician not supporting the Igbo presidency project would be on a mission of self-destruction.\n\nUmeh, who spoke to newsmen in Enugu at the end of the Imeobi meeting of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide in Enugu, insisted that the people of the southeast were united in the aspiration that somebody from region should be the next President.\n\nHe maintained that any Southeast Governor or Igbo leader who is not standing with their people would become isolated.\n\nThe former APGA boss, who represented Anambra Central in the Senate, said: \u201cThe Governors jettisoning Igbo presidency are minority already. This is so because when you go out of the mainstream of your people\u2019s desire, you will be on a mission of self-destruction.\n\n\u201cMaybe some of them fell into the trap of comradeship of governors being brothers. But what is paramount is where your people stand. Everybody must stand with his people in leadership. If you don\u2019t stand with your people, you become isolated\u201d.\n\nHe added that ahead of 2023 presidential election, Southeast people have made it abundantly clear that for justice and equity to prevail in Nigeria, there is a compelling need for the region to produce the next President.\n\n\u201cThe Southeast has eminently qualified people who can provide leadership that will bring prosperity to Nigeria. It is not in doubt at all.\n\n\u201cIgbo leaders at the Imeobi meeting of Ohanaeze, which is the conclave, have painstakingly looked at these things and stand firmly together as a people that the only way Nigeria can move on will be for us to accommodate each other. We must show sincerity of purpose and mission towards achieving unity for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt does not help the country if people begin to tell others that they cannot do anything.\n\n\u201cActually, nobody can do it alone. We have said it clearly that for Nigeria to remain together, there is the need to share power with all Nigerians. It\u2019s not something somebody will take and run away. We have also looked at the demographics to prove that nobody can do it alone,\u201d Umeh said.\n\nHe advised Governors and political leaders from the region to be in the vanguard of the Igbo unity by standing with their people on the quest for a President of Southeast extraction.\n\nUmeh said: \u201cWe are appealing to our brothers, not only the governors but anybody who is still standing against this popular quest by the people of the Southeast to produce president, which incidentally the people of the Southsouth have supported through their cultural organization, PANDEV. The Middle Belt Forum and Afenifere have also supported it. So, there is no reason why a Southeasterner should be kicking out of the box.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to them to know that we must stick together to pursue our common destiny\u201d.\n\nHe assured that the Igbo would rally round any party that would choose its candidate from the Southeast.\n\n\u201cWhat I can assure you is that once somebody from the Southeast gets the position, the whole Southeast will root for that person.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, when Peter Obi became the vice Presidential candidate of the PDP, Ohanaeze Ndigbo endorsed that ticket of Atiku/Obi and Southeast delivered totally to the PDP. So, it doesn\u2019t matter where one or two persons are standing based on their personal relationships.\n\n\u201cThe people of the southeast are united in this aspiration that somebody from here should be the president next year. Not by force, but for is to heal the wounds of the past and move on together as a people\u201d.\n\nHe maintained that \u201cIt will be paying lip service for us to be one people, one country and one nation if we don\u2019t make efforts to really unite. Today, Nigeria is a country with so many nations. The only thing that is making it to look like that is because people are not happy with the way things are going.\n\n\u201cIf our political gladiators are sincere that they want to keep Nigeria together, the best thing to do is to support the southeast on the basis of equity and fairness.\n\n\u201cIn the southwest, you can see a lot of presidential aspirants are declaring. It\u2019s funny. The southwest produced Obasanjo for eight years and their son is the current vice president and will serve out eight years next year and election is coming up next year and all.of them are declaring.\n\n\u201cI think that they\u2019re looking for a break up of Nigeria. This is because if they want Nigeria to be united, they will not be seeking to occupy that office in 2023. It will be insensitivity to the need to gum our people together. Let them be united in one mission of having a virile, united country.\n\n\u201cIf at the end of the primaries and they think that they can do it that way, I can assure you that the restiveness in the country would continue.\n\n\u201cSo, we give to Caeser what is Caeser\u2019s and give to God what is God\u2019s. Justice does not hurt anybody\u201d.",

          "text": "The Yoruba people of South-west Nigeria have a saying: when a child rejects instructions at home, it is from outside that such child is trained.\n\nAnd that was exactly what happened on Tuesday and Wednesday, this week, when United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Gutteres visited Nigeria as part of a three nations African tour. He said it was \u201ca visit of solidarity with all Nigerians, particularly the victims of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe UN Scribe was visiting Nigeria for the first time, and he had probably fallen for the antics of the Western media, and some unpatriotic Nigerians who have nothing good to say about their own country. They even visit the UN and parliaments of leading countries of the world, to de-market Nigeria.\n\nGutteres had probably thought he was coming to a country where hopelessness and despondency were order of the day. He started from Maiduguri, Borno State, once the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency in the country. When he saw what the Muhammadu Buhari administration, in conjunction with the Babagana Zulum government had done, he had a quick rethink.\n\nAt a meeting with President Buhari on Wednesday afternoon in Abuja, he declared: \u201cI was extremely surprised. The image that exists is of a hopeless situation. But what I saw was a Borno of hope.\u201d\n\nI chuckled as the international public servant expressed his consternation. He said he visited a centre where former Boko Haram fighters were being rehabilitated, and also camps of internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to provide a vision of the future for the people. Vision of jobs, schools, health institutions, and the like. And that was what was being done. It is a remarkably wise and well conceived strategy.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Fed Govt takes over Ebonyi medical varsity as Buhari inaugurates projects\n\nBut the naysayers, the wailing wailers, always say President Buhari has not achieved anything in the country. They see roads, rail, bridges, airports, but they say he\u2019s not doing anything. Well, like the contumacious child, who refused to take instructions at home, an outsider has come to tell them the home truth.\n\nThey say Nigeria is good for nothing. Gutteres says the country \u201cis a pillar of continental and global cooperation-and a steadfast partner of the United Nations.\u201d He added: \u201cNigeria is a country where Africa\u2019s promise and potential come to vivid life.\u201d\n\nThat is the same country that a clergyman, who should inspire hope and faith, says has been broken, completely destroyed and thrown to the dustbin. Well, when a child refuses to take instructions from home\u2026\n\nThe UN scribe said Nigerians were fantastic people, and the country has \u201csolid institutions, and a vibrant private sector.\u201d But that is not what some ever cynical Nigerians say about their country, and that is not the picture they go abroad to paint of their country. Shame, I say again; shame.\n\nPresident Buhari said Boko Haram was the major security challenge his administration inherited in 2015. \u201cThey will kill people, and shout \u2018Allah Akbar,\u2019 (meaning God is great). But when you do that it is either you do not know that God, or you are being stupid. God is justice, and you can\u2019t take an innocent soul, and say God is great.\n\n\u201cWe began to educate the people, and gradually, they understood that Boko Haram was not about religion. The group is largely decimated today, and government is trying to resettle the people. We are trying to get them back to the land, and things will get better in the near future.\u201d\n\nYet they say Buhari hasn\u2019t achieved anything. When your adversary sees your robust horse, standing in all its grandeur, he turns up his nose, and says; see this dwarf horse.\n\nThey have eyes and see nothing, they have ears and refuse to hear. Well, an outsider will one day come to tell them the truth.\n\nThe Secretary-General said the people he saw in Maiduguri \u201cremain hopeful and committed to returning to their communities and resuming their lives.\u201d\n\nStill commending the Buhari administration, he welcomed \u201cthe establishment of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Returns and Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the North-East.\u201d\n\nBut to some of our people, the country is broken, destroyed, and nothing is working. Well, when a child refuses to accept instructions given at home, an outsider knocks sense into his head eventually.\n\nHear Gutteres again: \u201cAnd I thanked President Buhari for his unwavering support of the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission.\u201d\n\nYet, to the permanent critics, Buhari is not doing anything, and has not achieved anything. I hear.\n\nIn 2011, Boko Haram bombed the United Nations building in Abuja, killed many people, and completely wrecked the structure. The Buhari administration undertook the rebuilding of the facility, and got it delivered in good time.\n\nThe Secretary-General described it as \u201can impressive edifice, \u201c stressing: \u201cI want to thank the Government and people of Nigeria for not only hosting the United Nations, but for rebuilding and reopening the United Nations House in Abuja in 2019 following the terrorist attacks in 2011.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outsider appreciating the good works of the Buhari administration, which the willfully blind have refused to see, and the deliberately deaf have refused to hear. If a child stubbornly spurns instructions at home\u2026.\n\nLet\u2019s conclude with this very inspiring one from Mr Gutteres.\n\n\u201cMy trip to Nigeria is not to visit people in despair, but people filled with hope. When there\u2019s political vision, good things can happen.\u201d\n\nIf you have been deluded, brainwashed, hoodwinked into seeing your country as broken, destroyed, good for nothing, then begin to have a rethink. Those who fed you with that narrative have their own sinister agenda. Our country has challenges in security, economy, and other areas, yes, but it is neither broken nor destroyed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t say you are, nobody would say thou art.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari has worked for this country, and continues to work. Let not an outsider come and tell us the home truth that is right before our eyes.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "text": "\n\n*Says threat over zoning unacceptable\n\n\u201cThese Southerners contest the facts that the North has 78% of the landmass of Nigeria. They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined\u201d\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nNot comfortable with stereotypes and alleged blackmail anymore, a foremost umbrella body for the north, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), yesterday, reacted to the ongoing controversy and constant bashing of the region over zoning within the two leading political parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 and declared that the North would not allow itself to be blackmailed any more, neither was it afraid of the country\u2019s break-up.\n\n\n\nThe forum, in a statement in Kaduna, warned that gone were the days, when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nAccording to the statement signed by the Secretary General of the forum, Murtala Aliyu, the North is not and had never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President, maintaining however, that anything that would be done to achieve that must be in accord with the law and democratic principles.\n\nACF said some Southern politicians were already \u201cgiving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum not to elect anyone from the North as president or we will break up the country!\u201c\n\n\n\nIn the statement title, \u201cEnough of the blackmail\u201d, the ACF warned that gone were the days when Northerners felt blackmailed by certain narrative from the South, but that the times had changed.\n\n\n\nThe statement read: \u201cA long running political riddle that has continued to frustrate all efforts at achieving \u2018justice, equity and fair-play\u2019 is this: anything and everything in which the North has superiority or advantage or strength is, in the opinion of many Southerners, fake or contrived or speculative and therefore unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese Southerners contest the facts that the North has 78% of the landmass of Nigeria. They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey will never acknowledge the fact that all the beef, all the tomatoes, the onions, the beans, etc. consumed in the South, is produced in the North. They concede nothing. On the contrary, they say the North brings nothing to the table and is entitled to nothing. Not to an equitable share of national revenues, not to a fair share of employment in the public services or to admissions into public schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the law says, for example, that election outcomes must be based on one man one vote, they quickly dismiss it as an \u2018imposition\u2019 by Northerners. They contest every fact, every principle including those that formed the basis of our union such as our federation, our system of administration, our\u2077 democracy, etc.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd as we inch up towards the 2023 elections, it comes as no surprise that some Southern politicians are giving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum which roughly translates thus: elect no one from the North as President or we will break up the country!\n\n\n\nBut what are the facts?\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Fourth Democratic Republic is about 22 years old. Of this, Northerners ruled for only ten years. But in-spite of this, some southern politicians are furious, issuing dare warnings against the election of any Northerner as president. It has to be stated clearly and for the avoidance of any doubt that the North is not and has never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnything that will be done to achieve that, however, must accord with the law and democratic principles. Gone are the days when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe North does not seek to dominate any part of the country but will not submit itself to be relegated to serfdom. Those issuing ultimatums are to be pitied, knowing that they know not what they are doing. They own no patent nor monopoly of the art or science of ultimatums.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG), a private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group, has proposed a ten-point action plan under an integrated strategy for revenue optimisation, expenditure efficiency and public debt management.\n\n\n\nThe action plan was contained in a report submitted in Abuja, yesterday, to the Debt Management Office (DMO) under the auspices of Debt Management Roundtable (DMR), an initiative of the NESG and Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA).\n\n\n\nThe NESG chief executive, \u2018Laoye Jaiyeola in a statement highlighted the depth of research and sub-regional collaboration involved in the production of the report, as well as its significance for sustainable debt management across the West Africa sub- region, if implemented.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the NESG, our mission is an open, inclusive, sustainable and globally competitive economy. We champion sustainable debt management because unsustainable public debt accumulation is inimical to economic growth, not only in Nigeria but ECOWAS as a whole.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria is a focal point for debt sustainability, considering that the country accounts for 50 per cent and 67 per cent of the region\u2019s total debt and GDP respectively. This behooves us to adopt more sustainable strategies to create the required fiscal space for national development, with positive knock-on effects in other ECOWAS nations.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe presentation was graced by stakeholders from Nigeria\u2019s public and private sectors, including Dr. Abel Essien of the ECOWAS Commission; Paul Adeyeye, OSIWA and Zainab Mangga, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Country Office, among others.\n\n\n\nIn her keynote address, The Director-General, DMO, Ms. Patience Oniha, said: \u201cThe timing of the launch of the report could not have been more appropriate with the global debt levels already rising pre-COVID-19 and still growing since the COVID-19 pandemic started in the year 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cConcerns around debt sustainability have expectedly been heightened. According to the World Bank\u2019s World Economic Outlook, \u2018Globally, sovereign debt grew from 49.1 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 57.9 per cent in 2019, and in sub-Saharan Africa, from 35.1 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 55.4 per cent in 2019.\u2019 The respective figures for 2021 were 66.7 per cent and 60.3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe indications are that the trend will continue as the economic consequences of COVID-19 may linger for a longer period, coupled with the increased economic pressures in the form of rising inflation from higher food and energy prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe IMF projects in its World Economic Outlook for April 2022 that the average Debt to GDP Ratio in West Africa is expected to rise to 67.2 per cent in 2022 from 56.4 per cent in 2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his remarks, the DMR Chairman, Taiwo Oyedele, identified corruption in public spending, insecurity, geopolitical challenges, resource over dependency, and a shallow tax base as some major drivers of unsustainable debt.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe DMR report is holistic and includes workable recommendations that, if adopted, can prevent West Africa from getting into a debt trap. Debt in and of itself is not a bad thing. It is what we do with the debt that really counts.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo how can we begin to apply the resources that we make \u2013 whether internally generated or money borrowed \u2013 in an efficient manner to promote productivity and prosperity for our people.\n\n\u201d The report provides answers that should help steer Nigeria and other ECOWAS countries towards debt sustainability.\u201d\n\n\n\nInaugurated in March 2021, the DMR was tasked with providing viable alternatives and recommendations that government can apply to ensure public debt is sustainably managed. The urgency of the initiative was in response to growing concerns over rising debt profile in major countries, including Nigeria and possible spill-over effects to other ECOWAS economies if left unchecked.\n\n\n\nThe report provides some background on the ECOWAS fiscal landscape and public debt portfolio, including several policy recommendations for debt sustainability and key performance indicators.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022As project set to create 169,972 Jobs\n\nKasim Sumaina and Gilbert Ekugbe\n\n\n\nThe Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said the Lekki Deep Sea Port when completed would make Nigeria regain the maritime business that it lost to ports in Togo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana.\n\nAccording to the Minister, it would also be a big boost for Nigeria in its quest to take advantage of the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA).\n\nThe minister who said this during a tour of the Lekki Deep Sea Port, also estimated that over $201 billion in taxes, royalties and duties would be generated for the Nigerian government when the port commences operations in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nHe said the aggregate impact of the Lekki Deep Sea Port put at $361 billion in 45 years would be over 200 times the cost of building the port.\n\nAccording to him, the deep sea port would be a game changer because of the impact it would have on the nation\u2019s economy when completed.\n\n\u201cThe investment is huge \u2013 $1.53 billion on fixed assets and $800 million dollars on construction. In addition, it will create 169,972 jobs and bring revenues totalling $201 billion to state and federal governments through taxes, royalties and duties.\n\n\u201cThe direct and induced business revenue impact is estimated at $158 billion in addition to a qualitative impact on manufacturing, trade and commercial services sector,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, the minister said: \u201cThe Lekki Deep Sea Port, a build, own, operate and transfer concern, is a massive project, a game changer and a pace setter. It is the deepest sea port in Nigeria and West Africa, and that in itself is a unique advantage.\n\n\u201cA major advantage we have to leverage is transshipment. With this port, Nigeria will become a transshipment hub and the revenue we are currently losing to our neighboring countries will come here and that is big,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs you know, this project is being done in phases. Phase one has reached 89 per cent and will be completed in September this year. The facilities here are first class. We have seven ships to shore cranes and 21 RTG cranes.\n\n\u201cNo port in Nigeria currently has this. The excellent equipment is why this port can do 18,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (teu), which is more than four times the number that can currently be handled by our other ports,\u201d he averred.\n\nResponding, the Managing Director, Lekki Deep Sea Port, Du Ruogang, said the port would change the economic landscape of Nigeria and West Africa at large.\n\nHe said the Lekki port would soon become a central hub for the West African region.\n\nAlso, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers Council, (NSC), Emmanuel Jime, described the port as a game changer for the Nigerian economy, but stressed the need for critical infrastructure to be developed to ease evacuation of cargoes out of the port.\n\n\u201cWe need to map out modalities on how we can evacuate cargoes out of the port so that we do not have a replica of Apapa and Tin Can ports,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis visit is the second we are making to this area within a month, coming after our trip to the Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals as well as the Dangote Fertilizer on April 3rd 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Funds may put party in vantage position against opposition\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\n\n\nA conservative estimate by THISDAY has shown that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may rake in over N30 billion from the sale of nomination and expression of interest forms, giving the ruling party enormous firepower to face the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWith a huge war chest expected from sale of forms, the ruling party will have a commanding advantage in the field if the resources are properly deployed,\u201d a political analyst, who preferred anonymity, told THISDAY last night.\n\nThe presidential nomination form in APC goes for N100 million; the governorship form is sold for N50 million; Senate, N20 million; House of Representatives, N10 million; and House of Assembly, N2 million.\n\nA rundown on the expected revenue from the electoral process shows APC may generate over N2.3 billion from the sale of presidential forms; N2.8 billion from the sale of governorship forms; and roughly N6.54 billion from the sale of senatorial forms. The party could make about N10.8 billion from the sale of forms to a minimum of three House of Representatives aspirants from each of the country\u2019s 360 federal constituencies. And it could generate about N7.93 billion from the sale of forms to a minimum of four aspirants vying for each of the 991 House of Assembly seats across the country.\n\nTHISDAY arrived at these estimates looking at the number of likely contestants in the various categories of elective offices.\n\nSo far, 23 presidential aspirants have indicated interest in the presidency under the ruling party and APC is expected to generate N2.3 billion from the sale of presidential forms. As more contenders join the race or drop out of the race, the figures would either go up or come down.\n\nWith governorship elections holding in 28 states next year, THISDAY estimated that there would be at least two aspirants from each of the states, and at N50 million per aspirant, the party stood to rake in N2.8 billion.\n\nFor the Senate, there are 109 senatorial seats in the country, and with at least three aspirants from each senatorial district, and forms going for N20 million, the party may rake in N6.54 billion. The 360 House of Representatives seats, with an estimated three aspirants per federal constituency, and the form going for N10 million, give the party about N10.8 billion.\n\nIn addition, with an estimated four people picking nomination forms to contest in the primary election for each of the 991 House of Assembly seats, at N2 million per form, APC is likely to rake in N7.93 billion.\n\nThose that have either indicated interest in contesting the APC presidential primaries or picked their forms include the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Governor Muhammed Abubakar of Jigawa State, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, and former Senate President Ken Nnamani.\n\nOthers are former National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiohmole; former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige; Minister of Science and Technology, Dr, Ogbonnaya Onu; Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio; Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba; Gbenga Olawepo; Ihechukwu Dallas; Chima Usman; Tein Jack Rich; and Pastor Tunde Bakare.\n\nPolitical analysts believe with the ruling party raking in over N30 billion, it would be going into the election from a position of strength against the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which is working hard to take power from APC.\n\nNational Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, recently justified the high cost of the party\u2019s nominations forms, saying the party has no regrets whatsoever fixing the presidential form for N100 million. Adamu explained that APC came up with the idea to discourage spoilers and unserious contenders from the race.\n\nHe said the party did its homework before arriving at the amount, adding that the cost has to be high because of the need to raise sufficient funds to conduct primaries and successfully prosecute the coming elections.\n\nAdamu said the party was aware that some of the aspirants were not serious contenders but mere jesters out to cause problems.\n\nA source told THISDAY that about 50 per cent of the presidential aspirants might have paid the mandatory fees and collected the forms, while others were believed to be looking for money to beat the deadlines.\n\nThe party had in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, extended the time for the sale of expression of interest and nomination forms for the 2023 general election to May 10 due to what an insider attributed to the \u201clong holiday.\u201d\n\nIn a revised timetable released by the party\u2019s National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Argungu, APC said the last day for the submission of completed forms and accompanying documents would now be May 11.\n\nThe Jigawa State governor was said to have told APC stakeholders in Dutse on Tuesday, \u201cI will join the presidential race since everyone knows I\u2019m a highly qualified person to do the job.\u201d He reportedly said he was pressurised to contest for the presidential office by his colleagues.\n\nThere are also indications that the Kebbi State governor, Atiku Bagudu, may declare his interest in the presidency and pick his form soon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anambra State Governor, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, has announced the appointment of Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency for a four-year tenure.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Agbata will be expected to use his experience to help the government achieve its plans of building a mega-city. This will include expanding broadband access, digitising government services, and supporting technology startups in the state.\n\nAgbata brings over a decade of experience working in the technology sector in different roles in the media and startup space, experience that he believes will serve him as he begins a new chapter.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on how his past will help him in his new role, Agbata said, \u201cWith my industry experience, I will be able to quickly launch new programs, attract the right partners, strengthen the tech and developer communities, organise programmes and meetups, and tons of other initiatives and activities that will benefit both Anambra State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgbata\u2019s mandate will tie neatly into the state government\u2019s mission to make Anambra the digital and creative capital of Nigeria. Through the Soludo Solution, the state plans to train and support up to 10,000 youth annually while setting up a five billion venture capital fund to incubate and provide growth capital for startups.\n\nMuch of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector has been seen in Lagos State. However, growth in the industry needs to be spread across more cities if the country\u2019s unemployment rate is to be reduced.\n\nWith ICT\u2019s growing contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, some states have taken steps to take advantage of this trend.\n\nIn 2020, the Edo State Government launched the Edo Innovation Hub. The hub provides a place for state residents to convene and potentially build technological products.\n\nLast year, it inaugurated a board with Victor Asemota, SwiftaCorp Co-founder as its chairman; and Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President on Digital Transformation, as a member.\n\nAlready, the state has partnered with tech talent accelerator, Decagon in a project that plans to train 15,000 residents of the state in software development and is an attempt to follow and potentially leapfrog Lagos State as a top destination for technological innovation.\n\nOne factor that has aided the rise of Lagos as a tech hub is the existing infrastructure absent in most states in the country.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the South Eastern region of Nigeria, where Anambra State is, has the lowest Internet penetration rates, with 13.7 million users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing the number of residents connected to the Internet will be vital in achieving the government\u2019s goals. Already, the previous government has set the ball rolling by waiving the right-of-way charges for telcos in the state, paving the way for the new government to build on it.\n\nIn Agbata\u2019s experience and Soludo\u2019s previous experience as a Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the state could become a digital powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be learning about the Web3 from experts. Isn\u2019t this something you should look forward to too?\n\nInterestingly, Bolu highlighted five ways we can learn Web3 at the Summit here: 5 ways to learn about Web3 at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass up this opportunity to learn from great minds. To attend, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nProblems YC-backed startups are solving\n\nTikTok\u2019s Pulse\n\nTigerrise\u2019s plan to improve mental health\n\nWhat problems are YC-backed startups solving?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe you\u2019ve been seeing Y Combinator (YC) posts in our newsletter for over a week now. And I understand how tiring it can be to see the same thing repeatedly.\n\nDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m about to change that. This is a new story. And, I won\u2019t bore you. You\u2019d tell me if I was, won\u2019t you? \ud83e\udd14\n\nKeep in mind that Chimgozirim had a chat with the founders of Y Combinator (YC) in March 2022 and told us how they work. Please read it here: Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows more interest in East and North Africa\n\nBesides, on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, we issued a report indicating the following:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can, of course, download the report here. It\u2019s completely free.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s crucial to note that 95 African companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, roughly half of which are 51 fintechs from Nigeria. Most importantly, it\u2019s also critical to ask questions such as, \u201cWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve?\u201d\n\nAccording to our data, these startups are active in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics. So, again, what problem are they attempting to address?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, is likely to have an answer to your question. Please look at it here: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\n\nTikTok to split ad revenue with creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall this: Meta needs to get over TikTok? Interestingly, TikTok appears to be upping its game, leaving Meta with no breathing room. Maybe some sleepless nights for Meta in the coming days?\n\nWhy? TikTok has introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that will allow brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nIsn\u2019t this fantastic news for TikTok Pulse creators? To put things into perspective, ad revenue will be split 50/50 between creators and publishers. This is similar to what YouTube offers creators, who reportedly receive a 55% cut.\n\nNow, you\u2019re interested, aren\u2019t you? But there\u2019s a catch: TikTok says p,m Pulse will be available only to creators and publishers with at least 100,000 followers, and even then, ads will only appear alongside \u201cthe top 4% of all TikTok videos.\u201d\n\nMoreover, TikTok\u2019s Pulse will also ensure that creator content is \u201csuitable\u201d for advertisements.\n\nThis means that Pulse will allow brands to target their ads to specific areas of TikTok. Brands can use Pulse to place ads alongside videos in 12 different categories, including beauty, fashion, pets, gaming, TV & movies, auto, Spanish language, sports and recreation, and more.\n\nFor the time being, this feature will be available to a select group of users in the United States beginning in June 2022. And sometime in September 2022, more countries.\n\nTigerrise to improve mental health access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emily Underworld on Unsplash\n\nIn Africa, mental health care is scarce. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), 75-95% of people with mental illnesses do not have any access to appropriate care in low and middle-income countries.\n\nTo back up this claim, Kenya\u2019s health ministry reports that 75% of people in need of mental health services cannot obtain them. Knowing the stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses in Africa, I don\u2019t think this is breaking news.\n\nWhy? Studies have shown that Kenyans suffering from mental illnesses are frequently stigmatised on several levels.\n\nConsequently, Tigerrise \u2014 a company which uses data-driven insights to disrupt the delivery of health and wellness services positively \u2014 has partnered with the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nMoreso, it has received a $1 million grant to empower Kenyan youth to take charge of their mental and physical health to increase access to mental health care in Kenya.\n\nWhat\u2019s in for Kenyans? Over the next three years, the Elton John AIDS Foundation\u2019s $1 million grant will ensure that all Triggerise-affiliated clinics in Mombasa, Kenya, provide mental health screening and services ranging from individual and group counselling to trauma-based care.\n\nMoreover, these services will be fully integrated with Triggerise\u2019s existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for young people aged 15 to 24.\n\nSince seamless access to SRH is critical for this age group, the collaboration will ensure that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services are part of Triggerise\u2019s established offerings in Mombasa.\n\nRichard Matikanya, Triggerise\u2019s Chief Operating Officer said, \u201cThe timing of this investment is particularly exciting, as the growing mental health burden among young people in their diversity \u2014 particularly those living with HIV \u2014 has largely been overlooked. Our partnership will allow us to contribute to the evidence base on how to ensure that young people have access to mental health services that respond to their needs on their terms.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LOOK LIKE?\n\nChange: an Opportunity rather than a Fear\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d \u2014 and other lies I\u2019ve loved\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to state that technology and exposure have changed how startups operate in Nigeria. After its first entry with Senegal\u2019s Wave, Y Combinator, one of the most prestigious accelerators in the world today, has gained increasing prominence in Africa.\n\nResearch from the good folks at Intelligence by Techpoint, our data and research team, has shown that African startups, on average, enter YC within a year or two of launch.\n\nIn March 2005, four illustrious professionals decided to start a company that would change how venture capitalists (VCs) invest in startups. With a seed fund of $150,000, the company took in the likes of Reddit in its first batch and has gone on to fund an enviable list of startups, including Stripe, Airbnb, and OpenSea.\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Y Combinator has seemingly increased its focus on Africa annually. This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Nigerian startups have dominated the scenes, gravitating towards the accelerator. Little wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria. Egypt comes in at a distant second with 12 startups, while Kenya rounds up the top three countries with 9 startups.\n\nDifferent interested parties have reasons for Nigeria\u2019s seeming dominance in YC, but it\u2019s not so surprising for the accelerator.\n\nKat Manalac, Head of Outreach at Y Combinator, points out that when one company from a region goes through YC, gets featured in the press, and raises money after demo day, more founders from that region start applying the following year.\n\n\u201cWe saw this in 2014 with Algolia \u2014 the Algolia founders were some of YC\u2019s first French founders. They went through YC in Winter 2014, and in the following batch, we saw 17 French founders go through the program. This is what started happening with African companies after Paystack went through the batch,\u201d she says.\n\nCombined, Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups had raised $1.3 billion as of March 2021, with two of them \u2014 Wave and Flutterwave \u2014 reaching a billion-dollar valuation. Paystack, another huge success story, was acquired by Stripe, a US-based payments startup, for $200 million in 2020.\n\nThese headline-grabbing stories appear to show investor attraction for YC-backed companies. For most investors, getting into YC means that a startup now has a higher valuation. But the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\n\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\n\nWhile this might be the most obvious question, I guess we should have framed it thus: What problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve? Why? To use the Nigerian parlance, \u201cProblem nor dey finish\u201d, which simply means problems are never ending.\n\nOur data shows that these startups are playing in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll work our way up from the industries with the least focus to the ones with the most focus for this article. We found some startups working in some unexpected industries, but you\u2019ll have to download the report to find out.\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms are together because each sector has only one YC-backed startup trying to solve its problems. This is hardly surprising, considering that only 5% ($245m) of the $4.9 billion African startups raised in 2021 went to the Education sector.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s education startups didn\u2019t get up to 3% of startup funding in 2020 ($1.07 billion), Media and Telecoms did not make any notable imprint on the funding numbers for 2021 and 2020.\n\nThese startups have raised a combined $7.2 million and are seemingly making decent strides in their respective industries.\n\nIn 2021, the African Union reported that there were 42 million out-of-school children in Africa, with 40% of this number coming from West Africa. Six out of ten Africans are still without access to the Internet, and affordability remains a big issue for those who have access.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are huge capital-intensive sectors and might not be appealing to the fast-paced, high-growth nature of modern startups. But we might just be an innovative execution away from the problem. Easier said than done, we know. As for media? That\u2019s a different ball game entirely.\n\nOther sectors like Real Estate and Marketing also feature in this group.\n\nEnergy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, two Energy startups have gone through the prestigious accelerator programme and closed a combined $22 million to date. Slightly better than the three industries above, renewable energy solutions have attracted decent funding in Africa.\n\nWhile it only accounted for 5% ($245 million) of funding in 2021, it took 22% of funding in the previous year. A cursory glance at the numbers, which show that 43% of Africans didn\u2019t have access to electricity as of 2019, evidently points to a vast untapped market.\n\nLike Telecoms, this is also capital intensive, and from what we\u2019ve observed, several renewable energy solutions are barely affordable for the average (or even upper-middle-class) African.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all its classes and tasty nutrients, food is an integral part of society. So far, YC has funded three startups looking to provide tech-enabled solutions for food security in Africa, and they have secured a combined $64 million.\n\nLike the previous industries, it appears there\u2019s a low investor appetite for startups building agriculture solutions across the continent. Agriculture startups accounted for 4% of funding in 2021, lower than 7% in 2020.\n\nAccording to world vision, 282 million people are undernourished in Africa, and that\u2019s just one result of several underlying problems. While food prices keep rising, 37% of food produced gets wasted.\n\nMobility & Logistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility & Logistics is at the heart of commerce and nearly everything we do. To date, six African Mobility & Logistics startups have gone through YC, raising $94.6 million. A trend we observed is that most of these startups are based in North Africa, with roughly 30% from Nigeria.\n\nRecent funding announcements have shown a renewed interest in eCommerce in North Africa. Overall, Mobility & Logistics companies accounted for 10% of the total funding in 2021, a marginal improvement from 7% in 2020.\n\nWhen we split both sectors, we\u2019ll find that most of these companies are logistics companies. Mobility startups, on the other hand, have not raised as much.\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nAfrica\u2019s Health sector is huge not for its number of hospitals and medical infrastructure but for the number of problems waiting to be solved. Everything, from preventive healthcare, telemedicine, health insurance, and precision medicine, represents critical areas in Africa.\n\nY Combinator has invested in eight African Health startups that have bagged a combined $115 million. These startups offer diverse healthcare solutions in preventive healthcare, health insurance, cancer diagnostics, medical logistics, and precision medicine.\n\nNine out of the top ten causes of death in Africa are health-related problems that run pretty deep. While healthcare startups are emerging, their services are mainly meant for a particular class, so it\u2019s hard to see how they can reach the mass market without significant regulatory backing.\n\nHealth startups accounted for 8% of 2021\u2019s funding, not improving on 9% in 2020. While technology is great, there are other serious considerations beyond its scope \u2014 for now at least.\n\nMarketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace startups have grown in popularity in recent years, and platforms that simply offer the technology to connect sellers to buyers are popping up with diverse execution strategies. So far, YC has invested in 17 startups looking to help Africans buy and sell online.\n\nConsidering the well-documented struggles of Jumia and Konga, questions abound on the viability of eCommerce startups in Africa. But these questions have not stopped YC-backed African eCommerce startups from bagging $138 million to date.\n\nOverall, eCommerce startups have accounted for 3% and 5% of funding in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also noteworthy is that an increasing number of eCommerce startups are now serving businesses rather than consumers directly.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services startups are the cream of the crop and the most popular sector by almost any metric in use. It has attracted the most funding and, perhaps, the most media attention for the past four years.\n\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni. They\u2019ve collectively raised over $854 million, about 65% of the total funding raised by Africa\u2019s YC alumni.\n\nHowever, this trend is not peculiar to YC. Fintech companies accounted for 62% of funding in 2021, mainly due to megadeals from Flutterwave and Chipper Cash. In the preceding year, fintechs grabbed 33% of funding, still much higher than any other sector.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons for the prominence of fintech companies. Over half of the continent\u2019s population does not have access to formal financial services. As of 2020, the median age of Africans was 19.7 \u2014 this means half of the population was younger, and half of the population was older.\n\nMost fintech companies\u2019 efforts do not seem geared toward improving financial inclusion but rather promising a better experience for people who already have bank accounts. However, the jury is still out on how successful they\u2019ve been.\n\nPayments, for instance, have witnessed the most advancement. With the exploits of Paystack and Flutterwave, API-led fintechs are changing how financial companies communicate, but nearly every other sub-sector is still in the early stages.\n\nWhy is the focus on fintech?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we fund is typically a reflection of what strong teams are applying with,\u201d says YC\u2019s Manalac, in response to our question on fintech\u2019s evident dominance.\n\nManalac\u2019s assertion suggests that the company does not deliberately look out for fintech companies, but it receives several applications from founders offering financial services solutions.\n\n\u201cThat payments lead the way shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because it is a primary pain point for all human beings irrespective of where you are, and is one area that technology has proven that it can build solutions for,\u201d says Adesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier/SSA Banks & Fintech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital.\n\nPelumi Aboluwarin, CTO of Nigeria\u2019s Nomba (formerly Kudi), maintains that running a business is hard, so payments shouldn\u2019t be difficult too. Perseus Mlamba, CEO, Zambia\u2019s Union54, also argues that payment is the key to unlocking innovations in health, agriculture, and industry.\n\nWhile both founders run prominent financial services startups, Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of Releaf, a Nigerian Agritech startup, agrees.\n\n\u201cFintech was the first piece of our growing innovation story so it makes sense that most of the investment and attention so far has gone to that sector. However, as innovation from more sectors emerges, I believe we will see a more diverse split.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, we can safely say that YC-backed companies are mainly looking to solve problems in finance, eCommerce, logistics, and Healthcare. As these entrepreneurs gain more experience, we should better understand how these tech solutions could be best applied in an African context. As the founders we spoke to explained, going through YC is just the beginning.\n\nLooking to understand how YC\u2019s activities are changing Africa\u2019s startup landscape? We spoke to some prominent entrepreneurs who have gone through the accelerator to gain insights. Watch this space on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content.

By doing many activities in minutes, these programmes save a lot of time and money. Otherwise, businesses will have to recruit workers to complete those jobs. Integrating the appropriate business software might help your firm grow at an incredible rate. That is why you should get Nicholas Idoko Technologies to develop a bespoke software application for your business.\n\nThe integration of software applications is critical for automating the organization\u2019s tasks as well as reporting on the progress or lags in the activities. This increases the efficiency and efficacy of the business\u2019s operations. The software automates processes and reduces workload. It also aids with the removal of human errors, resulting in increased efficiency and consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies use a variety of different types of business software. The payroll system is one of the most critical pieces of business software for any company. This software is critical for managing employee and contractor payments within the company. This programme is capable of calculating compensation and tax deductions for every employee in the company. Booking applications are very important for any business that renders a service. Your customers will be able to easily book your service and you can keep accurate records of how many customers you got per time, how many new customers you gained, how much money you made and so on. You can even get reviews from your customers to gauge how well you are serving them and what needs to be improved.\n\nOther types of business applications include Human Resource Information System (HRIS), Inventory Control System, Communication Software, Accounting Software, Service Management Solution, Schedule Management System, Demand Forecasting Software and so on!\n\nAt Nicholas Idoko Technologies (NIT), we develop all kinds of software applications. From websites to desktop applications to mobile apps and even blockchain applications, we do it all!\n\n\n\nWe Teach Coding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a long time, computer programming has been a trendy topic. Programming abilities, from software engineering to front-end development, offer good job opportunities in today\u2019s technology-driven society. The average salary of a software developer in Nigeria is N300,000. Computer programming is also one of the most adaptable occupations; it allows for a wide range of specialisations, as well as the flexibility to work from home.\n\nComputer programmers are in high demand now and will continue to be in the future. With many senior programmers retiring and new technologies appearing regularly, the globe will require skilled computer programmers to keep up with the rapid pace of development. To be successful in their computer coding careers, programmers require a diverse set of abilities, including mastery of front-end and back-end languages, tools, and frameworks.\n\nAt NIT\u2019s LearnCode platform, we offer courses in several programming languages including HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Apache Cordova and more! Our platform is beginner-friendly in every aspect from the course material to the assignments and projects.\n\nThe perceived difficulty is one of the most prominent reasons why people don\u2019t want to learn how to code. Some people begin learning but abandon it halfway through because they become trapped or find it too tough to comprehend. You might be wondering if coding is difficult to learn and whether the effort is worthwhile. The truth is that learning to code is not as tough as many people believe. You can become an expert at it with the correct mindset, determination, and learning aid.\n\nOn the LearnCode platform, one lecture will be offered to you every day. This lesson may consist of text and/or videos that have been sourced to assist you in your quest to become one of the top coders. There is an assignment for each of these lectures. Answering these questions improves your reward score and grants you superior access to the platform, as well as upgrading your badge of honour. You can also ask direct questions during any of these courses, and you will receive a direct response.\n\nOnce you sign up, you get the first month of lectures for free. After that, you would need to pay a tidy subscription fee of NGN 1,500 (~$4) per month.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about changing careers and becoming a programmer, you should know that software developers work on interesting projects and earn good money. Not to mention, they\u2019re becoming increasingly popular. LearnCode will prepare you for a rewarding and joyful life.\n\nOur Blog section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople read blogs every day for one reason or the other. There is always something they want to find out about or learn how to do. For fans of entertainment blogs, there\u2019s always more gist to get. For tech blog fans, there\u2019s always a new trend, upgrade or invention to discover in the world of tech. There are so many reasons 77% of internet users today read blogs. People want to gain knowledge, be entertained look at certain topics from other points of view, learn about other disciplines of life that they had no idea about or just distract themselves and pass time. This all goes to show that blogs are still very relevant and important.\n\nThe blog section of the Nicholas Idoko Technologies website is a must-visit for people wholike to learn new things and have their curiosity piqued. Our lead writer, Miss Olamide Fred-Ahmadu, is good at carefully crafting interesting writeups about various topics in different fields of life. We have blogs in different categories like life, love, health, work, investment, technology, blockchain and more! Let us walk you through a few of our blog sections.\n\nIn our blog titled \u201cWhat you are to know about NFTs\u201d, we defined an NFT as a digital asset that depicts real-world elements like art, music, in-game items, and films, bought and traded online, often using cryptocurrency. They\u2019re usually encoded with the same software as many other cryptos. They can only have a single official owner at a time and are secured by the Ethereum Blockchain which means no one has the ability to change the ownership record or create a new copy of an NFT.\n\nWe also discussed how NFTs work, how they are created, what they are used for and how they are bought. Interesting, right?\n\nIn the technology category, we have quite a few blogs. One of the most interesting ones is the one about Technological singularity. The term \u201cTechnological Singularity\u201d or as it is otherwise known \u201cThe Singularity\u201d, is a common theme in science fiction. There are a lot of books, comics and movies about how robots become intelligent and gain a sort of consciousness where they no longer need to be controlled by humans. Usually, they form an uprising and enslave the human race. If you\u2019ve watched movies like The Matrix and Transcendence, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m talking about. In this blog, we answered a lot of questions concerning technological singularity like Is \u2018The Singularity\u2019 real? Is it feasible? Could it be a good thing? Or would it be the end of humanity as we know it? Are we close to achieving it? It really is an interesting read.\n\nIf you like money, don\u2019t miss out on our investment section. The blog post of note, for now, because there\u2019s a lot more to come, is the one titled \u201cReal Estate: The Safest Way To Invest!\u201d Many people are hesitant to engage in real estate because they believe it is risky or requires a large sum of money. Neither is correct.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, real estate is an excellent investment. You can benefit from high rates of return, significant tax benefits, and the ability to use real estate to grow your wealth. In this blog, we discussed the top five reasons why real estate is a solid investment.\n\nDid you know that your mental health is just as important as your physical health? When you hear the word \u201chealth,\u201d what comes to mind? Most of our minds instinctively think of physical health when we hear the words \u201cexercise,\u201d \u201chealthy diet,\u201d \u201cdrinking water,\u201d and so on. While physical health is vital for keeping our bodies in shape and working properly, maintaining our mental health is as important for living a healthy and happy existence. Hence, our health section focuses on both mental and physical health.\n\nIn our work section, we discuss several work-related topics like workaholism, toxicity in the workplace, how to be a good manager, the life of a digital nomad and so on! In case you are looking to start a career in digital technology, be sure to read our \u201c10 Lucrative Professions in Digital Technology\u201d blog.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to strike a balance between your business and personal lives, but it\u2019s necessary. Work frequently takes precedence over all other aspects of our existence. Our ambition to achieve professionally sometimes cause us to put our own well-being on the back burner. Creating a harmonious work-life balance, or work-life integration is vital not only for our physical, emotional, and mental well-being but also for our professional success. In our \u201c10 Strategies for Achieving Good Work-life Balance\u201d blog, we offer helpful work-life balance advice to employees. Other topics in our life section include family, parenthood, marriage and so on.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a company, we work with your budget to develop your ideas and projects beautifully and elegantly as well as participate in the growth of your business. We do a lot of freelance application develoment in various sectors such as blockchain, booking, e-commerce, education, online games, voting, payments and more.

We are readily available.\n\nBe sure to check out the Learncode platfrom today to begin your journey to a successful career in programming. Remember, you get to learn at your own pace for free for the first month and then for a decent sum of NGN 1500 per month\n\nAlso be sure to explore the many categories of topics that our blog section offers. Theres already a lot of content available and we publish more everyday!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

We should be united and not be our own opponents. The way we go about this primary election is very important.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time since 1999 that a fundamental amendment has been made to the Electoral Act. After the primary election, we have nine months to prepare and campaign and the journey will not be easy or cheap. We should conserve our energy for this process. We should work in unity to win the forthcoming EDHA election in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have a primary election coming up and I am not asking anybody to step down but to sit with party leaders and see how to discuss and dialogue to reduce the number of aspirants to enable us to work better. If everyone decides to go into the primary, so be it as we all belong to one big family.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cPDP will select candidates to go and contest for the position against candidates from other parties. For contestation at this level, we can\u2019t be our own opponents. In any particular constituency, only one or two people will win, depending on the number of seats. We all will rally round to support those that emerge and together we will win the election.\u201d\n\nWarning against politics of bitterness, the governor stated, \u201cI want to warn all the aspirants, I don\u2019t want any of you to spend your future or sell your properties because of the election. There is a lot of bitterness in politics; we need to stop this as it can\u2019t lead us to the political evolution that we desire. Edo is a pacesetter.\n\n\u201cI want to stay neutral in the build up to this primary despite the several calls I have received. Every aspirant is my own; the PDP is one and my goal is that the PDP must win at the state level, National Assembly and Presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first step towards winning. I want us to be strong and not go into the contest weak,\u201d Obaseki urged.\n\nOn his part, Edo PDP Chairman, Tony Aziegbemi disclosed that 164 aspirants bought the EDHA forms, while 162 persons returned their forms and were screened and cleared to contest the primary election.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Monday Iyore Osagie, Hon. Reuben Ikponmwan Ekhosuehi, Hon. Adeyanba Michael Osaro, Hon. Magdalene Omosigho and Hon.

          "text": "PETER OKORE, Umuahia\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections in Nigeria, a panel of discussants in Umuahia, Abia state, has advocated for training of the political-class, especially those contesting for elective positions, on the role of journalists in the realization of the social contract during elections.\n\nThe measure will help to create a better understanding between the functions of a true journalist, the politicians and expectations of the general public.\n\nDuring the one-day Summit organized by the Abia state chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, to mark the day, the panel was of the view that most politicians are ignorant of the actual role of the media, adding that misconception was responsible for why most politicians see the Journalist/ media-men as enemies or people who have come to expose their secrets; whereas the journalist is one who aims at putting facts to the public the exact way(clarity) it is or happened.\n\nSpeaking on the Theme: \u201cJournalism Under Digital Siege\u201d, the panel advised Government functionaries, institutions and corporate bodies to avoid situations where practicing journalists could be put under siege and gagged in the discharge of their lawful duties or Government Information- managers adopting a system of \u201cdichotomy\u201d in the use of journalists to cover Government House activities\n\nIn a lead paper to mark this Year\u2019s Day, a university Don, Associate Professor Uwaoma Uche called for the streamlining of the responsibility of the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), Nigeria Communication (NCC) and Nigeria Press Council (NPC) to include regulation of the digital and internet based media to ensure sanity in journalism practice.\n\nUwaoma , who is Head of Mass Communication , Gregory University, Uturu, said that most content creators of the internet and digital media are not trained journalists and may not understand the requirements of social responsibility which is a major reason of putting the journalism practice under surveillance.\n\nIn his view, Press Freedom, though fundamental like other freedoms, was not absolute. He stressed the need for the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) and other stakeholders to institute a framework to assess the performance of the various governments in Nigeria on Freedom of Information Act. He urged journalists to embrace adequate training in digital journalism to be able to reduce if not eliminate the activities of challatants parading themselves as emergency journalists on the social media space.\n\nHe warned conventional Journalists to purge themselves of uncertificated operators who pose as citizen and online journalists without the requisite training in journalistic ethics and social responsibility and noted that cultural and religious differences should not be used as a tool to limit press freedom.\n\nIn his contribution, a veteran journalist and former Secretary to Abia State Government, Chief Ralph Egbu cautioned practicing journalists in Abia State against setting the state ablaze through clannish and sentimental reportage in the face of heightened political activities.\n\nChief Egbu challenged journalists to refuse situations where they could be used to cause trouble in the state but be in the vanguard of promoting peace, tranquilty and good governance as well as take interest in law making through balanced reportage that would set agenda for both politicians and the public.\n\nThe veteran, who doubles as a former Commissioner for Information, Culture and tourism in Abia State, said that the struggle between press freedom and the so called siege would always be there but maintained that the work of the dutiful journalists would always speak for them.\n\nHe urged journalists to jettison laziness and take their pride of place while encouraging them to strive to own media spaces both digital and conventional media, stressing that such attempt would make the real practitioner to dominate the media space with verifiable reportage.\n\nChief Egbu and other contributors at the summit were full of praises for the Abia NUJ for organizing the World Press Freedom Day celebrations. They, however, called for more on-line training for Journalists to enable them perform their duties in- line with ethics of the profession, protect their sources as well as compete favourably in the contemporary world\u2019s information dissemination- processes.\n\nEarlier, the chairman for the occasion, Prof Anthony Agbazuere, called on the National body of the NUJ to work-out some welfare packages for their members.\n\nHe said the Abia state government would not discriminate against Journalists posted to Abia state to cover happenings in the Government House and entire Abia state.",

With estimates that 75 percent of essential needs for maternal and reproductive health care are met by midwives, it is concerning that the comparative figure for the WHO African Region is only 41 percent.\n\n\u201cMidwives are central to the prevention of maternal and newborn deaths, and stillbirths. With adequate investment in midwifery, the report says that 4.3 million lives could be saved annually by 2035. This has particular relevance for the WHO African Region, which records about 196 000 maternal deaths each year, along with the deaths of one million babies younger than one month.\u201d\n\nShe expressed worry over the existing gap, saying it has serious implications for the Sustainable Development Goal target of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 live deaths before 2030.\n\nThe International Day of the Midwife is celebrated every 5th of May. The occasion provides the opportunity to honour the work of midwives, and promote awareness of the crucial care that midwives provide to mothers and their newborns.\n\nMoeti noted that despite significant progress in Africa to reduce preventable deaths related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, the interruption of services due to the COVID-19 response is only one of several challenges that still remain.\n\nShe, therefore, urged governments and partners to substantially increase investment in the education, recruitment, deployment, retention and protection of midwives.\n\n\u201cThis is essential if African countries are to be capacitated to increase coverage and quality of maternal services, while still responding effectively to health emergencies,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday partly resolved the ownership dispute in 17 oil wells ownership in favour of the Rivers State government.\n\nIn a judgement prepared by Justice Ellen Ogunwumiju but delivered by justice Emmanuel Agim, the apex court dismissed the counter claim ownership put forward by the Imo State government.\n\nAccording to Justice Agim, reliefs one, three, four, five, and six sought by the Rivers State government were granted by the court.\n\nThe court, however, refused to grant reliefs Two, Seven, and 10.\n\nAmong the reliefs granted include that oil wells within Akri and Mbede communities are all oil wells within the territories of Rivers State and form parts of the state only.\n\nThe court also agreed that the correct instrument, maps, and documents relied on determining the boundary, were those used by the Rivers State government in delineating the boundary line between both states.\n\nIt granted the relief that Rivers map showing boundary line between the state and Imo State represents the correct boundary between both states.\n\nThe apex court, however, refused the sum of N500,000 as a cost for the prosecution of the suit instituted by the Rivers State government.\n\nIt also refused an order directing the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) to calculate and refund all revenue that have been wrongly denied to Rivers State or wrongly paid to Imo State.\n\nAt the last adjourned date of February 7 when the parties adopted their final brief of argument, the AGF had prayed the court to dismiss the matter and direct Rivers State to go and file a suit before the Federal High Court.\n\nIn the grounds of argument, the AGF and Imo State said witnesses of the disputed area ought to be called to give evidence before the suit could be amicably resolved.\n\nThey demanded that the intervention of the National Boundary Commission would also be required to give evidence at the Federal High Court before any conclusion could be drawn.\n\nBut counsel to the Rivers State government, Joseph Daudu, opposed the demand of the AGF and Imo State and asked the apex court to dismiss it.\n\nHe argued that documentary evidence placed before the court were enough for the Supreme Court to resolve all issues in dispute in relation to the oil wells.",

          "text": "Not comfortable with stereotypes and alleged blackmail anymore, a foremost umbrella body for the north, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), on Thursday, reacted to the ongoing controversy and constant bashing of the region over zoning within the two leading political parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 and declared that the North would not allow itself to be blackmailed any more, neither was it afraid of the country\u2019s break-up.\n\nThe forum, in a statement in Kaduna, warned that gone were the days, when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAccording to the statement signed by the Secretary General of the forum, Murtala Aliyu, the North is not and had never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President, maintaining however, that anything that would be done to achieve that must be in accord with the law and democratic principles.\n\nACF said some Southern politicians were already \u201cgiving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum not to elect anyone from the North as president or we will break up the country!\u201c\n\nIn the statement title, \u201cEnough of the blackmail\u201d, the ACF warned that gone were the days when Northerners felt blackmailed by certain narrative from the South, but that the times had changed.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cA long running political riddle that has continued to frustrate all efforts at achieving \u2018justice, equity and fair-play\u2019 is this: anything and everything in which the North has superiority or advantage or strength is, in the opinion of many Southerners, fake or contrived or speculative and therefore unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThese Southerners contest the facts that the North has 78% of the landmass of Nigeria. They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined.\n\n\u201cThey will never acknowledge the fact that all the beef, all the tomatoes, the onions, the beans, etc. consumed in the South, is produced in the North. They concede nothing. On the contrary, they say the North brings nothing to the table and is entitled to nothing. Not to an equitable share of national revenues, not to a fair share of employment in the public services or to admissions into public schools.\n\n\u201cIf the law says, for example, that election outcomes must be based on one man one vote, they quickly dismiss it as an \u2018imposition\u2019 by Northerners. They contest every fact, every principle including those that formed the basis of our union such as our federation, our system of administration, our\u2077 democracy, etc.\n\n\u201cAnd as we inch up towards the 2023 elections, it comes as no surprise that some Southern politicians are giving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum which roughly translates thus: elect no one from the North as President or we will break up the country!\n\nBut what are the facts?\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Fourth Democratic Republic is about 22 years old. Of this, Northerners ruled for only ten years. But in-spite of this, some southern politicians are furious, issuing dare warnings against the election of any Northerner as president. It has to be stated clearly and for the avoidance of any doubt that the North is not and has never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President.\n\n\u201cAnything that will be done to achieve that, however, must accord with the law and democratic principles. Gone are the days when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe North does not seek to dominate any part of the country but will not submit itself to be relegated to serfdom. Those issuing ultimatums are to be pitied, knowing that they know not what they are doing. They own no patent nor monopoly of the art or science of ultimatums. Enough of the blackmail.\u201d",

We just find a way to engage the marketers and the government on the ways to solve this problem. We don\u2019t want to push it to the flying public. Everything will continue normally. There is yet no official statement but the impact on our operations will be too much to bear and that is more reason why airlines want to engage government and marketers to find ways to resolve this. It is a big issue. AON needs to step action and engage the government. We want everybody to fly,\u201d Ezenwa said.\n\nDuring one of the meetings held in March at the instance of the House of Representatives Committee on Aviation, the AON threatened to shut down operations over the non-availability of aviation fuel for their airplanes, as fuel marketers gave reasons why they hiked the pieces.\n\nAON had told the lawmakers then that due to the increase in price of fuel and its unavailability, its members won\u2019t be able to sustain their operations and condemned the marketers for refusing to disclose the actual amount they buy aviation fuel per litre.\n\nCurrently the base fare of 45 minutes to a one-hour flight is N50, 000, which air travellers described as exorbitant, prompting many tavellers to shun the airports and there are indications that any increase to that base fare would further reduce passenger traffic at the airports.",

          "text": "Africa\u2019s richest woman and Vice-Chairman of FAMFA Oil Limited, Mrs. Folorunso Alakija, has stated that current reforms in the oil and gas sector are expected to have a far-reaching impact on revitalising the Nigerian economy.\n\nAlakija also stated that the 650,000 barrels per day Dangote Refinery currently under construction, which was expected to come on stream before first quarter next year, would also contribute a great deal in transforming the country\u2019s economy by helping to tackle petrol subsidy and over-reliance on imported petroleum products.\n\nThe FAMFA Oil\u2019s vice president was quoted in a statement to have stated these while speaking as a guest on a recent CNN interview programme, \u2018One World with Zain Asher,\u2019 where she equally discussed issues around climate change, the African economy, and how Nigeria can diversify its economy and focus on other areas that are safer for the environment.\n\nShe pointed out that as part of the structural adjustments to ramp up the nation\u2019s oil production, the government had introduced reforms such as the marginal field bid rounds, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and the transformation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) into a limited liability company through the PIA.\n\nShe said in view of the last marginal field bid rounds, which was as a result of the international oil companies (IOCs) divesting from some of their assets in the country, the industry now has more indigenous players that would help the growth of the economy.\n\nAlakija expressed optimism that the Dangote Petroleum Refinery under construction in Lagos, would bring a positive change in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry by helping to eradicate subsidy and boost the nation\u2019s refining capacity when operational later this year.\n\nShe added that the refinery would impact the economy such that the country would not have to import as much refined products as it currently does.\n\nThe richest black woman in Africa, who also expressed her views on climate change, highlighted the need for the government to diversify the economy.\n\nOn how Africa and Nigeria would successfully move away from the impacts of climate change on their economy, Alakija stated that the only way to reduce the impacts was for Nigeria and other African countries to pay more attention to other sectors that would not have damaging consequences on the environment.\n\nAccording to her, these sectors include the manufacturing, agriculture, services and entertainment, ICT, mining, among others, pointing out that those sectors have suffered because Nigeria had relied solely on oil revenue over the years.\n\n\u201cThere would be more demands on us now to look inward and to ensure that we are using our land, water, climate, and human resources to ensure that agriculture is ramped up again as it used to be the case before we found oil.\n\n\u201cThere is the ICT sector that we need to pay attention to, and I believe that Nigerians are making waves in that sector. Our mining is an area that we need to pay more attention to. I think those areas have all suffered because we have relied solely on oil over the years,\u201d Alakija said.",
