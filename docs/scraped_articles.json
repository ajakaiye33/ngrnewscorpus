          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA new study has indicated that preterm babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are at risk of developmental challenges that can affect their behaviour and ability to learn.\n\nThe study published by ScienceDaily found that rates of neurodevelopmental disabilities increased as gestational age decreased.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the study also revealed that preterm birth continues to pose a large burden for families, healthcare, and educational systems.\n\nThey noted that neurodevelopmental disabilities were found not only in children born extremely premature (22-26 weeks) but also in those born moderately premature (between 27 and 34 weeks).\n\nThe researchers stated that though survival of preterm babies has increased worldwide, children born early often have developmental issues.\n\nStudies, they said have mainly focused on those born extremely premature (22-26 weeks\u2019 gestation), noting that less is known about children born very and moderately preterm (27-34 weeks\u2019 gestation).\n\nThe study done in France studied neurodevelopment in children born before 35 weeks and those born at full term.\n\nThe researchers said their findings are based on 3,083 French children aged 5\u00bd born after 24-26, 27-31, and 32-34 weeks gestation who were taking part in the EPIPAGE-2 study (designed to investigate outcomes of preterm children over the past 15 years) and a comparison group of 600 children born at full term.\n\nNeurodevelopmental outcomes such as cerebral palsy, sensory impairments (blindness and deafness), and brain function (cognition), as well as behavioural difficulties and movement disorders, were assessed using recognised tests.\n\nThe researchers explained, \u201cTo further assess the family and social burden of prematurity, measures such as the need for extra support at school, visits to a psychiatrist, speech therapist or physiotherapist, and parental concerns about development, were also recorded.\n\n\u201cAfter adjusting for other potentially influential factors, we found that rates of neurodevelopmental disabilities increased as gestational age decreased.\n\n\u201cFor example, among the 3,083 children assessed, rates of severe to moderate neurodevelopmental disabilities were 28 percent, 19 percent and 12 percent and rates of mild disabilities were 39 percent, 36 percent, and 34 percent among children born at 24-26, 27-31 and 32-34 weeks, respectively.\n\nBehaviour was the concern most commonly reported by parents. Rates of neurodevelopmental disabilities were also higher in families with low socioeconomic status.\u201d\n\nExperts say babies born less than 34 weeks rarely survive without adequate neonatal care.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, preterm is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr. Bright Airhumwunde, says that, aside from placing a whole lot of burden on the society in terms of caring for very young children, preterm birth is the leading cause of under-five mortality worldwide and the leading cause of death of under-five children in Nigeria.\n\nDr. Airhumwunde noted that gestational age and delivery were the two major factors that determine the survival of preterm babies.\n\nThe gynaecologist pointed out that babies born below 34 weeks have a poor survival rate, while babies delivered above 34 weeks have up to 80 percent survival rate.\n\nHe identified respiratory distress as a major killer of babies delivered before 34 weeks.\n\n\u201cBabies delivered prior to 34 weeks need a lot of support to survive.\n\n\u201cBefore 34 weeks, the survival is usually less than 50 percent\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Yahaya Bello of Kogi has called on Nigerians to halt all forms of ethnic, religious and political divides threatening the peace, unity and development of the country.\n\nBello made the call on Wednesday in Abuja when he received members of the Ex-Agitators Forum from the Niger Delta on a solidarity visit to him for his achievements in security and unity in Kogi.\n\nHe said that Nigeria could only be fixed if everybody, irrespective of ethnic origin, religious and political views, came together.\n\nHe also urged youths to resist being used in perpetuating criminal activities especially by those who do not have the interest of Nigeria, but to stand up to become part of the leadership process at all levels.\n\n\u201cLet us come together as Nigerians, whether you are from Niger-Delta, whether you are from East, North, West, South, or not, let us come together.\n\n\u201cEnough of this divide and rule, enough of this ethnic sentiment, enough of these religious sentiments.\n\n\u201cThe time has come to produce the next leaders across board. Leadership at top levels comprising of all these ethnic groups and religions.\n\n\u201cI do not think you have ever seen our leaders exchanging blows during our meetings. We as elites are united, some only create the fights for you and you fight yourselves. God forbid, I will not belong to that.\n\n\u201cLet us not allow those who do not have the interest of Nigeria at heart use these sentiments to divide us and take our resources away and crumbs are thrown at us.\n\n\u201cNigeria is blessed; all it takes is good leadership to harness these blessings,\u201d said the governor.\n\nBello added that the Kogi strategy, if emulated across board, would bring the desired change and solution to the challenges confronting the country.\n\nHe noted that if his state with several different ethnic groups and religions could come together and see themselves as one, that it could be done in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat countries at war are experiencing, we do not have to experience it to learn. We the younger generations have to say no to these divisions.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that by our coming together, by our unity we will get Nigeria fixed and when we get Nigeria fixed we would have gotten Africa fixed,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, if Nigeria is fixed, it will not only become the African big brother, but will become home to even those in Diaspora.\n\n\u201cOur leadership in Kogi Sate and success recorded so far is not rocket science but common sense to bring out the best and ensure that the government reflects that of democracy,\u201d Bello said.\n\nHe commended the ex-agitators and the Niger-Delta region for the peaceful disposition they have demonstrated towards the present administration.\n\nSpokesperson for the forum, Mr Joshua Opia, said the group and the Niger Delta region commended the leadership styles and strategies of Bello, saying it had made Kogi amongst the peaceful states in the country.\n\n\u201cYour track record in Kogi State as a Youth friendly governor, how you brought the down-trodden to government, the man that changed the narratives of governance in Kogi State remains appreciated.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if every leader applied that same knowledge and wisdom Nigeria would be a better place for all of us,\u201d Opia said.",

Yahaya Bello of Kogi as their candidate for the 2023 Presidency.\n\nThe group made this known during a world press conference in Oberhausen, Germany as they also opened a campaign office to support the movement.\n\nIn a statement made available to vanguard Odijie Irabor, General Coordinator of the group said the group had jointly selected Bello following thorough research.\n\nIrabor noted that the attention of the International Community was however caught on Bello following his achievements of fighting insecurity, youth and women inclusion in governance, education development among others.\n\n\u201cWe embarked on a massive consultation with our people in diaspora through our various networks of social cultural organisations, political organisations, media, religious bodies and many.\n\n\u201cThis lead to the constitution of a high-powered committee to carry out a search for a young, viable, formidable, energetic, vibrant and result oriented presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential election in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe stated that committee selected Bello among other people for the following reasons:\n\n\u201cClamour for a youth president; Nigerians are condemning the preponderance of over-aged candidates for the exalted position of presidency.\n\n\u201cIn this current political dispensation, his Excellency Governor Yahaya Bello is known to be the youngest governor in Nigeria with the desired physical and mental capacity to meet the growing complexity and diversity in our political environment.\n\n\u201cHigh security index in Kogi state; The most important function of a responsible government is the provision of security for lives and property.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the total collapse of the security architecture in Nigeria, Kogi state under the leadership of his Excellency Governor Yahaya Bello has recorded a very stable security atmosphere across the state.\n\n\u201cIt must be emphasized that the result did not come by chance, but it was a pay-off of the Governor\u2019s security strategies and his all- inclusiveness governance approach\n\n\u201cCurrent developmental strides of His Excellency; our review of his achievements in terms of projects delivery was instrumental to our quest for him to run for the coming presidential election,\u201d Irabor said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Chairman of the group, Mr Victor Ojeabulu said that there are about 10 million Nigerians in Diaspora calling on all Nigerians to support a youthful candidate.\n\nOjeabulu called on all the youths in Diaspora and all the youths in Nigeria to rise up and take up the challenge with the present situation facing the country.\n\nMrs Maria Agbondinwin said that from all they have seen, heard and gathered about Bello, Nigerians in Diaspora are sure that he is the right person to make Nigeria great again.\n\n\u201cTrusting and believing you, we know that as a youth you are dynamic, we know you can make a change and we are waiting for that change.\n\n\u201cWe are standing by you and we know that you can make Nigeria great again\u201d, Agbondinwin said.",

Gory videos and pictures of human casualties have since been shared on several social media channels, inciting outrage and inflaming the social space.\n\nReacting to the attack, Ondo governor and chairman of the Southwest Governors Forum, Rotimi Akeredolu, in a statement on behalf of the forum, condemned the killings stressing that, \u201ccertain elements are bent on causing friction among the peoples of this country with the sole aim of achieving a pernicious end. We on our part are resolved to defend our people, their property, and all legitimate means of livelihood against both internal and external aggression. On this, there will be no compromise. We cannot afford to fail.\u201d\n\nThe attack on Igangan comes months after the head of the Fulani community in the town, Salihu Abdulkadir, was ejected by self-acclaimed activist, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, who accused him of complicity in the murders and abductions of farmers and residents of the community by criminal herdsmen. Although Abdulkadir denied the allegation, he was forcibly ejected from the community.\n\nIn the wake of the recent killings, pundits accuse Oyo governor, Seyi Makinde, his SGF peers and the state security agencies for failing to preempt the attack.\n\nAgain, the debate segues to the efficacy of the Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) code-named: Operation Amotekun as well as the politics of power and self-preservation that informed its establishment. Apologists of the vigilance group enthused that it would protect lives and property of Yorubaland. The group was expected to work with the police and other security agencies to protect the region from killer herdsmen, robbers and kidnappers among other terrors, claimed the southwest governors.\n\n\u201cWhoever comes to Yorubaland to kill are known. Amotekun has 10,000-year-old technology that nobody knows. Amotekun must stand, it is a protective force for Yorubaland,\u201d said an apologist.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get smitten by the romanticism and rage of it all. The politicised arguments, seasoned justifications, foxy upbraids and catlike ripostes attained harmony in the jarring snarl of the southwest\u2019s feline sentinel.\n\nThe drama intensifies but the effort has, so far, been unproductive. In the wake of the Igangan killings and similar attacks in Papalanto and Sagamu in Ogun State, many have questioned the relevance of the security group.\n\nWhile shared militia, driven by an autonomous but integrated command structure founded on superior, native intelligence seemed a worthy and commendable response to the forays of murderous herdsmen, armed bandits and kidnappers tormenting the southwest\u2019s outliers, the success of the venture depends on the quality of commitment vested in it by the SGF and other stakeholders.\n\nThe falsehood of bromides and artifice disinters to sinister truths; for instance, the politics and drama of Amotekun was predetermined along the rigid straits of the southwest regions socioeconomic and political realities which like previous initiatives of similar nature, fulfilled Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm stereotype.\n\nWhile career courtiers and so-called \u201csocial media influencers\u201d donned face powder and powered the governors\u2019 raucous orchestra, none acknowledged that we are at this sorry pass because the SGF and their peers across the country failed the electorate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe southwest needed an Amotekun because the governors had over time, failed to commit state resources to actualise development plans and policy objectives.\n\nIf they had spent judiciously on education, health, economy, and infrastructure, the region may have appreciated in scholarship, medical services, security and industry. The region, would thereby enjoy improved quality of youth and living standards, and an army of builders and progressives undeserving of enlistment as members of Amotekun, or the rampaging hordes of \u201creal\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d killer herdsmen, bandits and kidnappers.\n\nThe spectre of social unrest pervading the southwest, like neighbouring regions, feeds off the greed and ambition of inefficient leaders. While the region\u2019s vulnerability to attack manifests as a consequence of the unforeseen economic collapse, civil disobedience and widespread violence wracking neighbouring states, it\u2019s noisy plummet down the steep slope of anarchy is attributable to inefficient leadership.\n\nWhile we applaud Amotekun as a worthy response to the southwest\u2019s insecurity problem, the governors must facilitate seamless cooperation between Amotekun and state security outfits. They address, for instance, police contempt for the vigilance scheme. Several police officers have scoffed at the idea, lamenting that funding committed to Amotekun could serve better purpose if funnelled to improve police operations.\n\nThe governors must also seek the cooperation of their northern and southern peers, who have so far done little or nothing to improve cross-border security operations.\n\nMore importantly, they must rapidly re-enfranchise unemployed youths into legitimate, mainstream economy, and tear down the frames of the highly politicised, exclusive socioeconomic circuits to accommodate the impoverished divide. At the moment, the region suffers a dislocation between the short-term interests of the ruling class and the longer-term interests of the electorate.\n\nThe southwest governors must work against the notion that they haven\u2019t been able to resolve the region\u2019s security and development challenges because they are rich. Wealth and privilege insulates them from the major afflictions of the poor electorate; these include bad roads, substandard healthcare and education, and comatose infrastructure. Affluence permits them to turn those around them into compliant and expendable workers, hangers-on, sycophants, and candidates for lifeboat palliatives, like Amotekun.\n\nWealth, argues Fitzgerald, breeds a class of people for whom human beings are disposable commodities.\n\nAlthough the governors affect a protective mien, their actions resonate as chilling neglect of the miseries of the impoverished outliers.\n\nSadly, the citizenry\u2019s inability to grasp the pathology of their leaders as members of an oligarchic corporate elite makes it difficult to organise a resounding change in their fate via the ballot box.\n\nPolitics looms entwined with money and power across the region, two cuffs of its shackled-lyre.\n\nArmed with the cuffs, the governors turn the electorate into docile subjects of their godlike delectation; there is a vast disconnect between what they say and what they do. Sadly, the masses are blinded and enchanted by their illusions. No thanks to a fawning press and civil societies.\n\nWhile hope may yet flourish in its presence, this minute, Amotekun subsists as a frantic mental caress that induces weeping instead of applause. The masterminds (governors) grope and stroke their beloved (electorate) with calloused palms, violating the latter\u2019s psychic spaces even as you read.\n\nUntil they match in virtual lock-step with their campaign promises, the governors will loom as marketers of illusion, skittish shamans channelling deceit to trade in confusion. They would be continually seen as crafty fabricators of mood and gesture, prowling the edges of duty cloaked in deceit. These are truths that can\u2019t be ignored.",

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe United States Government has called for the immediate reversal of the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe call by the US is the fourth intervention the country has made in a week after last Friday\u2019s suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria by the federal government.\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power said the suspension was nothing more than state-sanctioned denial of free speech.\n\nPower noted that Nigeria has nearly 40 million Twitter users, while also saying that the country was home to Africa\u2019s largest tech hub.\n\nIn a Facebook post by the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, Power said the suspension should be reversed immediately.\n\n\u2018There are nearly 40 M Twitter users in #Nigeria, and the country is home to Africa\u2019s largest tech hub. This suspension is nothing more than state-sanctioned denial of free speech and should be reversed immediately,\u2019 Power said.\n\nThe United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria had last Saturday issued a statement where it said the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations was an infringement on the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.\n\n\u2018Nigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The Government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians\u2019 ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses. Banning social media and curbing every citizen\u2019s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater. The path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity,\u2019 the United States said.\n\nClosely followed by the statement was a joint release by the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, the United Kingdom, the Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Canadian High Commission and the Embassy of Ireland.\n\nIn the joint statement, the five missions expressed disappointment over the Federal Government\u2019s decision to place a ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018The diplomatic missions of Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America convey our disappointment over the Government of Nigeria\u2019s announcement suspending #Twitter and proposing registration requirements for other social media,\u2019 the statement partly read.\n\nThe US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, had while responding to a question concerning the joint statement on Monday during a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said the missions maintained their position.\n\n\u2018We remain firm in our position that free access to the ability to express one\u2019s self is actually very important, and perhaps even more important in troubled times,\u2019 Leonard said.",

          "text": "\u2022FG directs workers to resume work or face sanctions\n\nChuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe insistence of state governors to rely on the 45-day window provided in their agreement with the judicial and parliamentary workers for the implementation of its terms may prolong the ongoing strike by the workers, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThis is coming as the federal government has directed members of the striking Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria(JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria(PASAN) to urgently reopen all the courts and the state Houses of Assembly so that the May 20, 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA), signed by all parties on June 4, can take effect.\n\nHowever, the National Executive Committees (NECs) of the two unions will hold emergency meetings today to decide on the next line of action.\n\nThe federal government had three weeks ago brokered an agreement between the governors and the workers to end their 10-week-old strike.\n\nUnder the agreement, the governors were given 45-day window, with effect from the date of the agreement, to implement its terms.\n\nHowever, while the representatives of the workers promptly signed the agreement under the supervision of the Minister of Employment, Labour and Productivity, Dr. Chris Ngige, the representatives of the governors only endorsed the document last Friday.\n\nBut one of the conditions given by the workers to call off the strike was that while the agreement is being implemented, the governors should first release their May statutory allocations directly to them immediately after the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), held last month.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that after signing the agreements, the governors have not released the allocations due to the judiciary and the legislative arms of government.\n\nA source told THISDAY that the delay in releasing the allocations to the two arms of government in line with their financial autonomy status provided by the constitution was due to the inability of the states to immediately set up a State Allocation Accounts Committee (SAAC) and the State Houses of Assembly Services Commission in their respective states.\n\nThe setting up of SAAC and State Houses of Assembly Services Commission was also part of the agreement reached between the striking workers and the governors.\n\nThe source said the inability to set up these bodies immediately was the major reason stalling the release of funds to both arms of government.\n\nWhile the workers have demanded the immediate release of the allocations for them to call off the strike, the source stated that the governors are utilising the 45-day window provided in the agreement to implement the terms, including the release of the funds.\n\nHe added that some states have not set up SAAC and the State Assembly Services Commission for the various commissioners of finance and the representatives of the Conference of Speakers of State Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe governors are desirous of releasing the funds to the states\u2019 judiciaries and the legislatures, but these organs have to be set up first to become the avenue to moderate the disbursements of the funds like it is done with the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\n\u201cThe governors were given a 45-day deadline to set up these organs to enable implementation.\n\nTherefore, it is after the expiration of this 45 days that one can say that the governors don\u2019t want to honour the agreement with the judicial and the legislative workers.\n\n\u201cFor now, all processes are in motion and the necessary organs would be set up to ensure proper implementation as per the agreement.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEvery state will have to set up the SAAC and the State Assembly Services Commission. It is here the details of what every state has to pay to the legislature and the judiciary is to be worked out based on the agreed percentage.\n\n\u201cThe mode of payment is based on a percentage of the revenue generated by each state and not based on the total budget of the state.\n\n\u201cWho will receive necessary funds without the SAAC? So, let the proper thing be done. The governors are within the terms of the agreement reached.\u201d\n\nFG Directs Workers to Resume Work or Face Sanctions\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has directed members of the striking JUSUN and the PASAN to reopen all the courts and the state Houses of Assembly so that the May 20, 2021 Memorandum of Action, signed by all parties on June 4, can take effect.\n\nThe government said it might invoke sections of the Trade Disputes Acts if the strike continued.\n\nIn a statement yesterday in Abuja, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, decried the situation where the courts and the state Houses of Assembly are still shut for no cogent reasons.\n\nHe said going by the provisions of the May 20 Memorandum of Action, states had 45 days implementation window.\n\nThe statement, signed by the Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Mr. Charles Akpan, said: \u201cThe federal government has sadly noted that the MOA between all the stakeholders involved in the JUSUN/ PASAN strike, mainly JUSUN/PASAN, Governors\u2019 Forum and the Presidential Implementation Committee is yet to take effect because of non-compliance by parties.\n\n\u201cWe note that the strike has not been called off as of noon, today, June 8, 2021, leading to courts and various state Houses of Assembly still remaining under lock and key contrary to the promise made by the two unions at a further dialogue, which was attended by the President of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC).\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all federal courts have remained closed notwithstanding the fact that the federal level of government operates a financial autonomy for the judiciary through the National Judicial Council (NJC) and the National Assembly through the statutory transfer lines.\u201d\n\nNgige, however, said that he had advised all governors that have consulted with their heads of judiciaries and legislatures to go ahead and credit the accounts of judiciaries and legislatures before fine-tuning the laws.\n\nThe statement added that many governors are desirous that the state Houses of Assembly be opened so that they can enact the laws meant to give effect to the autonomy as enshrined in the MOA.\n\n\u201cWe are worried and therefore wish to appeal for the last time to all parties involved in the signed agreement to abide by its spirit and letters, by firstly re-opening all the courts and the state Houses of Assembly so that all other ingredients in the MOA can be given full compliance by all parties concerned.\n\n\u201cThis much was agreed to between JUSUN/ PASSAN and the governors\u2019 forum at the last meeting on Friday, June 4, 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister added that with the courts closed , the police and other security agencies cannot prosecute criminals.\n\nThe statement said that the ministry would not be happy to be pushed into invoking sections of the Trade Disputes Acts capable of eroding all the gains made so far in the negotiations since May 6, 2021.\n\nWorkers Hold Emergency Meeting Today\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the NECs of both unions will meet separately today in Abuja to reconsider issues that led to the over two-month- old industrial action.\n\nIt was learnt that the NEC meetings would be held to get the views of members of the two unions on whether or not to suspend the strike.\n\nDeputy President of JUSUN, Mr. Emmanuel Abisoye, told THISDAY yesterday that the NEC meeting would review the progress made so far in the agitation for financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nReacting to the threat by Ngige, Abisoye said the union had not done any wrong to warrant any threat from the government.\n\nAccording to him, it is the state governors who have failed to implement the provisions of the Memorandum of Action that such threat should be directed at.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "W\u2019Bank Raises GDP Growth Forecast for Nigeria to 1.8%",
          "text": "By Obinna Chima in Lagos and Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank has increased Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth projection for 2021 to 1.8 per cent, higher than the 1.1 per cent it had estimated for the country earlier this year.\n\nThe Washington-based institution, in its June 2021 Global Economic Prospect released yesterday, also forecast the GDP growth to hit 2.1 per cent for the country in 2022, compared with the 1.8 per cent it had predicted for Nigeria in the earlier report released in January.\n\nNigeria recorded a GDP growth rate of 0.51 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021, (Q1 2021) compared with the 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2020, according to figures the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released last month.\n\nBut the World Bank hinged its positive prediction for Nigeria on the expectation that crude oil prices would remain high as well as the government effecting structural reforms and flexible exchange rate management.\n\nIt said: \u201cGrowth in Nigeria is expected to resume at 1.8 per cent in 2021 and edge up to 2.1 per cent next year, assuming higher oil prices, structural oil sector reforms, and market-based flexible exchange rate management.\u201d\n\nThe report stated that output in Sub-Saharan Africa shrank at an estimated 2.4 per cent in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a milder-than-expected recession.\n\nIt added that growth in the region has gradually resumed this year, which it stated was a reflection of positive spillovers from strengthening global economic activity, including higher oil and metal prices, and some progress in containing COVID-19, especially in Western and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has contributed to wider budget deficits and a spike in government debt, heightening the risk of debt distress in some countries. Activity in the three largest economies\u2014Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa\u2014 has partially recovered.\n\n\u201cMany industrial and agricultural commodity exporting countries experienced deep contractions last year. In tourism reliant countries, international arrivals have been at a near-halt, and tourism is likely to remain slow until wider vaccination permits safe reopening to international travel.\n\n\u201cDespite improvement, COVID-19 has continued to have adverse impacts on health, schooling, investment, and economic growth,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the report, in some countries such as Angola and Nigeria, accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, currency depreciations, and rising food and energy prices \u201chave stoked inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cElsewhere (Kenya, South Africa), subdued demand has kept inflation in check,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the report, foreign direct investments in the region have been resilient, recouping about nine-tenths of their pre-pandemic levels, and workers\u2019 remittances to the region have held up better than expected.\n\n\u201cGrowth is forecast to resume to 2.8 per cent this year and firm to 3.3 per cent in 2022, underpinned by stronger external demand, mainly from China and the United States, higher commodity prices, and containment of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cProcurement and logistical challenges are expected to continue hobble the pace of vaccination despite the provision of vaccines by COVAX. Policy uncertainty and the lingering effects of the pandemic are expected to delay major investments in infrastructure and extractives and to weigh on the recovery (Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Niger, Kenya).\n\n\u201cPer capita income levels in 2022 are expected to be four per cent lower on average than in 2019. Conditions in the region\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected countries are expected to be particularly challenging; their average output level in 2022 is forecast to be 5.3 per cent below its size in 2019,\u201d it said.\n\nIt stated that while some countries (Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa) are presently upgrading national vaccine distribution systems, procurement and logistical hurdles in many other countries could slow vaccinations.\n\nIt, however, warned that an oil price drop could dent revenues for some oil exporters.\n\n\u201cFood insecurity remains a key risk as food prices have risen by more than 20 percent early this year in Angola, Ethiopia and Nigeria. Flood and drought could also destroy crops, exacerbate food price inflation, and further weigh on household consumption.\n\n\u201cRising conflicts could weaken recoveries. A sudden rise in sovereign borrowing costs could instigate financial pressures in some countries and high debt burdens and fiscal pressures could become more acute.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the pace of vaccinations could surpass expectations, restoring consumer and business confidence and strengthening the recovery. A stronger-than-expected rally in metal and oil prices could boost revenues,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe global economy was expected to expand by 5.6 per cent in 2021, the fastest post-recession pace in 80 years, largely on strong rebounds from a few major economies.\n\nThe projected expansion would make 2021 the fastest year of growth since 1973\u2019s 6.6 per cent.\n\nHowever, many emerging market and developing economies continue to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, the World Bank said.\n\nAccording to the 189-country anti-poverty agency, the world economy, which shrank 3.5 per cent last year as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trade, forced businesses to close and people to stay at home, will grow 5.6 per cent this year, up from the 4.1 per cent it forecast in January.\n\nBut the World Bank noted that despite the recovery, global output will be about 2 per cent below pre-pandemic projections by the end of this year.\n\nPer capita income losses will also not be unwound by 2022 for about two-thirds of emerging market and developing economies.\n\nAmong low-income economies, where vaccination has lagged, the effects of the pandemic have reversed poverty reduction gains and aggravated insecurity and other long-standing challenges.\n\nCommenting on the report, World Bank Group President, Mr. David Malpass, said: \u201cWhile there are welcome signs of global recovery, the pandemic continues to inflict poverty and inequality on people in developing countries around the world.\n\n\u201cGlobally coordinated efforts are essential to accelerate vaccine distribution and debt relief, particularly for low-income countries. As the health crisis eases, policymakers will need to address the pandemic\u2019s lasting effects and take steps to spur green, resilient, and inclusive growth while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NBC to license OTT\n\n\u2022House probes legality of stoppage, summons information minister\n\n\u2022Despite ordering violators\u2019 prosecution, Malami accesses Twitter, deactivates account\n\n\u2022Trump lauds Nigeria over Twitter\u2019s suspension\n\nEzeobi Chiemelie in Lagos, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe suspension of the operation of American microblogging company, Twitter, in Nigeria by the federal government is to remain indefinitely until the company shows remorse, a top federal government official told THISDAY yesterday.\n\nAccording to him, since the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria last Friday, the company has not reached out to the federal government for dialogue.\n\nHowever, the House of Representatives has waded into the dispute as it mandated its Committees on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence to investigate the circumstances leading to the suspension of operations of Twitter in Nigeria and the legality of the action.\n\nIt also summoned the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to shed light on the matter.\n\nBut despite the suspension and the order by the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), to prosecute violators of the suspension directive, many prominent Nigerians and some organisations have remained active on the microblogging site.\n\nNotwithstanding his order, Malami yesterday logged on to Twitter, using Virtual Private Network (VPN) to bypass the blockade by telecoms companies that have blocked access to the site, to deactivate his account.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that contrary to the impression given to the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth-Leonard, that Twitter was already holding talks with the federal government, the source said no discussion was going on.\n\nBeth-Leonard had led heads of the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland missions to a meeting with the Minister Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, on Monday in Abuja, where she said she was glad to learn that Twitter was negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the source said: \u201cAs we speak, there has been no communication between Twitter and the federal government, and until the company does the needful, its operations will remain suspended indefinitely.\u201d\n\nThe source said the federal government suspended Twitter because it had persistently made its platform available for the propagation of activities of persons who want to destabilise the country.\n\nHe said when the federal government complained, Twitter said the propagandists had not violated its rules.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the federal government approached Twitter to remove a tweet by Nnamdi Kanu but the company responded that the material did not offend its rules,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that even after that, Kanu used Twitter to ask his followers to kill Nigerian soldiers and police personnel and they obeyed.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf that is not offensive, what is?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, over the top (OTT) companies operate in Nigeria without registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and paying tax on the billions they make in the country.\n\nThis, he said, would no longer happen as henceforth, the OTTs would now have to register as Nigerian companies and would be expected to comply with the terms of their registration with the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC).\n\n\u201cAnyone of them that is not registered would not be allowed to operate. Anyone that abuses the terms of its registration would have its licence withdrawn,\u201d he added.\n\nHouse Investigates Legality of Suspension, Summons Information Minister\n\nThe House of Representatives has mandated its various committees to probe the circumstances of the decision by the federal government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria and the legality of the suspension.\n\nThe House also summoned the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to appear before it and explain the reasons for the action.\n\nThe directives were contained in an address delivered by the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, at the resumption of plenary yesterday.\n\nGbajabiamila said the lawmakers were aware that the suspension of Twitter had generated a fierce debate, adding that the House has since the announcement been inundated with comments about the decision, requests for intervention and criticism.\n\nHe stated that the House recognised that Twitter, like other social media networks, is an important tool for communication and commerce in Nigeria, particularly among the younger generation who have used these networks for enterprise and innovation.\n\nHe, however, said the House also recognised that as social media has been a tool for good, it could also be a tool for bad actors, hence the government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that these platforms are not used to commit vile actions against individuals and the state.\n\nAccording to him, it\u2019s the proper role of the legislature in circumstances like this to unravel the issues until they develop an understanding of the why and the how of executive decisions.\n\nGbajabiamila added that the legislature must ensure that regulatory and enforcement actions by the government are in accordance with the laws, due process followed and the outcomes of regulatory decisions do not result in adverse consequences for the country and its people.\n\nHe gave the committees 10 days to conclude the assignment and report back to the House for further legislative action.\n\nHe said: \u201dWe listen to the agitation of the people, but we also hear from the government so that from the abundance of information, we reach the level of awareness that allows us to discharge our role dispassionately. It is in service of our obligations under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and our moral duty to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe speaker also decried the spate of killings across the country.\n\nHe said the attacks called for coordinated and targeted action by government at all levels to address the menace and save the nation.\n\nPDP House Members Stage Walkout at Plenary\n\nHowever, a mild drama ensued yesterday when the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House staged a walkout at the plenary after Gbajabiamila ruled out of order, their prayer calling on the federal government to reverse the suspension of Twitter operations in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila, in his address, had apparently preempted the opposition lawmakers when he mandated the various committees to probe the circumstances of the decision by the federal government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nBut the leader of the PDP caucus, Hon. Kingsely Chinda, raised a point of order, citing section 39 of the constitution, section 19 of the Universal Declaration on Human and Peoples Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights and commended the steps taken so far by the speaker.\n\nHe added that while he agreed with the submission of the leadership of the House, the House should urge the executive arm to reverse the suspension, while the committees continue their assignment within the stipulated 10 days.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile I agree with the submission of the leadership of this House completely, I will only want to add that for the breach of our fundamental human rights, particularly the right to fair hearing, right to freedom of speech and expression, we should urge the executive arm in the interim to reverse the ban pending our interaction with the executive.\u201d\n\nBut the speaker ruled him out of order, saying that since the matter has been referred to committees already, it was wrong for it to be revived again.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me quickly refer you to Order 9, Rule 1 Sub Rule 6 of our rules, which states that it shall be out of order to reconsider any specific question upon which the House has come to a conclusion during the current session except upon a substantive motion for rescission.\n\n\u201cThis matter has already been sent to the committees to look at the issues you are talking about and will report to us within 10 days. Even if you had brought a motion here, it would have been referred to a committee. We are not even sure if your motion would not have been killed. This day, we have saved the day. So you are ruled out of order.\u201d\n\nChinda, however, insisted on being heard, but the House Leader, Hon. Alhassan Doguwa, and Chief Whip, Hon. Mohammed Tahir Mongunu, asked him to be guided.\n\nIt was at this point that a visibly angry Chinda and some other members of the caucus walked out of the plenary.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers later addressed the press on their grievances, saying that the members would continue to tweet in disregard of the suspension and are ready to be jailed.\n\nHowever, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi, later raised a point of order, alleging that there was an earlier plan by some members to disrupt the business of the House if their demands were not granted.\n\nSuspension Unprofessional, Ill-advised, Says Catholic Church\n\nThe Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) has described the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria as ill-advised.\n\nIn a statement yesterday by the Secretary of CSN, Rev. Fr. Mike Umoh, the church said the action was condemnable.\n\n\u201cWhile the Catholic Church is not against regulations of media use, she abhors when such action is selective or used as tool for suppressing the people.\n\n\u201cThis is one decision that will further paint this government in darker pigments as anti-people and anti-democratic,\u201d he said.\n\nUmoh stated that as a mark of the futility of such actions, even some people in the government are reported to have still used the facility after the suspension, while many Nigerians resorted to the use of VPN and remote proxy options.\n\nDespite Ordering Violators\u2019 Prosecution, Malami Accesses Twitter, Deactivates Account\n\nMeanwhile, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice , Mr. Abubakar Malami, yesterday deactivated his account.\n\nMalami posted the screenshot of his deactivated account, which showed a VPN symbol, on his Facebook page.\n\nHe, however, did not state how he was able to access his Twitter account since all telecommunication companies had blocked access to Twitter through their networks, forcing Nigerians to download VPN.\n\nHis Facebook post attracted varied reactions from his followers, with,l some Nigerians, mostly supporters of the government, praising him for compliance with the directive.\n\nBut another follower, Masta Pee, who wrote: \u201cHow did he deactivated his account without logging in to Twitter?\u201d\n\nHe was followed by Roy Ekwueme who wrote: \u201cThis is an evidence that you logged in Twitter today via VPN to deactivate your account, which is punishable under your unlawful law.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how you will prosecute others without throwing yourself in jail.\u201d\n\nAkintunde Babatunde said: \u201cHow are you able to deactivate Twitter without VPN? You should be arrested.\u201d\n\nTrump Lauds Nigeria over Twitter\u2019s Suspension\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has praised Nigeria for banning \u201cevil\u201d Twitter and encouraged other countries to do the same in the name of \u201cfree and open speech.\u201d\n\nA report on the website of DAILY BEAST, a news publication based in the United States, yesterday quoted\n\nTrump, who himself was banned by the platform for incendiary rhetoric, as saying in a statement that \u201cmore countries should ban Twitter and Facebook for not allowing free and open speech\u2014all voices should be heard. Who are they to dictate good when they themselves are evil?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I should have done it while I was president,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump also appeared to confuse Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. \u201cZuckerberg kept calling me and coming to the White House for dinner telling me how great I was. 2024?\u201d he wrote. The praise comes after it was announced earlier this month that Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram would remain banned until early 2023.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, defied the Nigerian government\u2019s Twitter ban.\n\nThe government had last Friday banned Twitter after the App deleted a controversial comment made by President Muhammadu Buhari, in which he made reference to the Nigerian Civil War, which many Nigerians described as distasteful.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nAmidst the public outcry and criticism that followed the government\u2019s decision, Malami on Saturday directed the Director of Public Prosecutions in his office to begin the process of prosecuting violators of the government suspension order.\n\nHowever in a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday, the Attorney General posted a screenshot from the Twitter app showing his account has been deleted.\n\n\u201cMy Twitter account deactivated,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSaharaReporters further gathered that the Minister downloaded Virtual Private Network in order to visit Twitter to deactivate it.\n\nA critical look at the photo by just clicking on it showed that indeed Malami had accessed his Twitter account with the aid of a VPN. See Also Politics REVEALED: How Malami Downloaded VPN, Logged Into Twitter To Deactivate Account\n\nThis is however not the first time the Minister would be disregarding laws made by the Buhari-led government despite being the Chief Law Officer of the country.\n\nHe has also been constantly accused of using his influence in the government to promote impunity and human rights violation.\n\nIn July 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols and guidelines were flouted during the wedding Fatiha of Malami\u2019s son, Abdulaziz, to Khadija Danbatta as guests were seen in a video dancing and communicating close to one another without wearing face masks.\n\nThe Minister was also seen in the video spraying wads of cash at the event, against the rule of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which forbids anyone from abusing the naira by spraying and stepping on them in public. See Also Politics Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Malami, Buys Multi-million Naira Mansion For Newly Married Son, Guests Flout Social Distancing Guidelines During Lavish Wedding Ceremony\n\nThe lavish ceremony did not only breach the laid down protocols of the NCDC but also violated the stipulated number of persons approved to attend a social event at that time by the Nigerian government.\n\nNot only did participants at the ceremony, which took place inside the Kano State Government House, more than 20, many of them did not wear face masks to protect themselves and others from contracting Coronavirus.\n\nAlso, the large number of top serving and former government officials including leading players in various industries from across the country present at the ceremony showed that indeed more than a few private jets touched down in Kano on the date for the event.\n\nFindings by SaharaReporters further revealed that a former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, former Zamfara governor, Abdul'aziz Abubakar Yari, incumbent governor of Sokoto and Zamfara states, Aminu Tambuwal and Bello Muhammad Matawalle, were among dignitaries that graced the occasion with their entourage.\n\nA former Speaker of Borno State House of Assembly, Goni Ali Modu, House of Representatives Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, Minister of Power, Engr Sale Mamman, and Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kolo Kyari, are among other top functionaries present at the wedding inside the Kano State Government House.\n\nCuriously, ex-Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, who was arraigned in court on May 5 this year by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for alleged N714 million fraud also attended the elaborate ceremony in Kano on Saturday.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the wedding ceremony also turned out to be a nightmare for motorists and commuters in Kano, one of the busiest cities in Northern Nigeria, who woke up to the sight of armed security personnel barricading roads in key locations within the metropolis.\n\nIn separate reports, SaharaReporters had revealed how Malami bought a N300 million mansion for his son and wife in Abuja as gift in addition to another N100 million property in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State constructed under less than two months.\n\nPersons close to the AGF, told SaharaReporters that since being appointed into the government of President Muhammadu Buhari in November 2015, Malami, a lawyer not well known before then, had embarked on a relentless purchase and construction of property through alleged public funds.",

          "text": "Members of famous Indian family the Sandesaras, indicted or on the run for tax evasion, loan fraud, and other alleged offences enjoy state protection from Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria, says an investigative report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nThe Sandesaras\u2014Chetankumar, his wife Diptiben, and elder brother Nitin had been on the run since 2017, when authorities in India accused them of defrauding local banks out of loans worth over $700 million at the time.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nDespite the allegations and their fugitive status, the family had been allowed to invest in projects in Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria. In fact, they hold Albanian and Nigerian passports.\n\nThe OCCRP investigation says high-ranking Albanian and Nigerian officials helped the family evade repeated attempts to extradite them to India. Police reports, court documents, interviews, and flight data obtained by reporters show how these officials allowed the family to move freely and continue to run their businesses while at large.\n\nNigeria's Attorney-General rebuffed an Indian request for their extradition, arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated.\n\nDocuments obtained by OCCRP also show that Indian state companies continued to buy hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil sourced from the Sandesaras\u2019 Nigerian firm after the family went on the run - implying that the family yet maintains ties with some state authorities in India.\n\nThe family owns Nigeria-based Sterling Oil Exploration and Energy Production Company (SEEPCO).\n\nThe brothers\u2014Nitin Sandesara and Chetankumar Sandesara\u2014control some 340 companies, including 92 outside India in energy, construction, and healthcare. Their conglomerate has claimed to be worth nearly $7 billion.\n\nAs their wealth grew, the family became a staple of the Indian tabloids, which gushed about their extravagant properties, lavish parties, and appearances with Bollywood stars. In one anecdote, Chetankumar reportedly complained to journalists when a media portal underestimated the cost of the family\u2019s new jet.\n\nBut the Sandesaras\u2019 fortunes shifted in the fall of 2017 when the Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi accused them and their company of cheating and criminal conspiracy. A subsequent investigation by the Indian government\u2019s Enforcement Directorate claimed that their Sterling Biotech group had criminally acquired and laundered over $700 million for the benefit of its \u201cpromoters,\u201d including the Sandesara brothers and Diptiben.\n\nInvestigators claimed that the family\u2019s companies had obtained the money by fraudulently obtaining loans from various Indian banks. In 2019, the amount those banks declared as fraudulent had risen to over $1.1 billion (about N600 billion).\n\nMuch of this money was allegedly siphoned off using shell companies which listed employees and associates of Sterling Biotech as their shareholders and directors. Prosecutors say the money was transferred under the guise of asset purchases and property transactions. These transactions were also allegedly used to inflate the balance sheets of the shell companies, which then borrowed even more money from the banks and diverted those funds as well.\n\nThe Sandesaras also appear to have played politics in Kosovo. In February 2019, Kosovo\u2019s then Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj posted on Facebook that he had met with Chetankumar Sandesara, describing him as a \u201crepresentative of \u2018Sandesara Group\u2019 from Nigeria,\u201d to discuss investments in tourism and agriculture.\n\nThey have found shelter in Nigeria, along with lucrative business opportunities.\n\nIn 2011, SEEPCO partnered with Nigerian-owned Allenne Energy Ltd. on a concession licence to exploit an oil field worth over $3 billion. Nigeria\u2019s then-president Goodluck Jonathan named Sterling as one of the country\u2019s top 100 businesses in 2014.\n\nThe accusations against them back home do not seem to have troubled Nigerian officials. A month after they were charged in India, Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, who was Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs between 2016 and 2018, wrote to the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking for Nitin Sandesara to be appointed honorary consul to Nigeria. She cited Nitin\u2019s \u201ceffort to expand the friendship\u201d between Nigeria and Albania and \u201cthe need to provide [an] avenue for boosting trade and investment relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nAlbanian authorities immediately began the process, and Nitin received the position in January 2019, a year after he and his brother received their Albanian citizenship.\n\nIn June 2018, Nigeria\u2019s judiciary also handed down a ruling that reinforced the narrative that the Sandesaras had faced persecution by Indian authorities. The decision was made as part of a suit filed by Allenne Energy to prevent information about the Nigerian oil concession from being shared with any law enforcement agencies or banks in India or Nigeria.\n\nAllenne\u2019s suit alleged that the Indian banks were acting with \u201culterior motives\u201d and asked the court for a declaration that the \u201cchange of government in India as well as the government policies and political and religious victimization and persecution of [SEEPCO] constitute force majeure capable of raising concerns by [Allenne Energy] in protecting its interest.\u201d\n\nA judge in Nigeria\u2019s Federal High Court agreed, writing that the Sandesara brothers and their families were being \u201ctargeted by Indian government agencies\u201d for their political and religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt would be inappropriate for this court to allow any Nigerian company to be economically imperiled, because of political vendetta of Indian Government and banks,\u201d the judge\u2019s statement read. \u201cNigeria is keen on keeping and protecting the present legitimate investors and to even encourage more to come into the economy.\u201d\n\nLater, in 2019, Nigeria\u2019s justice ministry made a similar argument when it rejected a request from India to extradite members of the Sandesara family, citing its power to refuse requests if it believes that the offence is \u201cpolitical in nature.\u201d\n\nPrashant Bhushan, the prominent public interest lawyer in India, called the High Court\u2019s decision \u201claughable,\u201d and pointed out that the Sandesaras are close to a former top Central Bureau of Investigation officer, R.K. Asthana, whose daughter\u2019s wedding was held in their farmhouse.\n\n\u201cSomeone who is so close to Asthana cannot fear persecution by the Indian government,\u201d said Bhushan, who in late 2017 made public a diary belonging to the Sandesaras that allegedly detailed kickbacks to top Indian officials. \u201cA sham show is being put on to show that an attempt to extradite them is being made.\u201d\n\nWhether or to what extent the Sandesaras have been protected in India is a matter of debate. Indian authorities have reportedly sought to freeze over $2 billion worth of Sandesara assets as part of their investigation.\n\nBut oil shipping data provided to OCCRP also shows that state-run Indian companies continued buying Nigerian crude sourced from SEEPCO even after the money laundering charges against the Sandesaras, raising questions about how hard the Indian state and the defrauded banks are working to reclaim the money they allege the family stole.\n\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well. A copy of both this case and the decision by Nigeria not to extradite the four family members were given to the Tirana District Court by a special envoy of the Nigerian government.\n\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",

This is an incremental provision to the N100 billion already provided for in the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cThe council also approved an aggregate sum of N770.60 billion to further enhance the capacity of the defence and security agencies to address current and emerging security challenges in our country.\u201d\n\nAhmed noted that the bill would be transmitted to the national assembly for approval.\n\nShe added that the council also approved permission to borrow N722.53 billion for security expenditures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe will be working with the World Bank to restructure some of the existing facilities to realise this N39.58 billion. We have also been given approval to withdraw N135 billion from some special reserve lobby accounts to part fund this supplementary budget but specifically related to COVID-19 vaccine, salaries and other health-related expenditure as well as the recurrent component of the defence and security expenditures,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFinally, this approval also contains an approval to borrow the sum of 722.53 billion for security expenditures and these are the capital components of the security expenditure in the absence of any other additional supplementary sources of borrowing.

          "title": "Here\u2019s why Apple\u2019s planned privacy safety feature won\u2019t roll out in three censorship-heavy African countries",
          "text": "This year\u2019s edition of Apple\u2019s annual software developer conference, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), kicked off on Monday with a roughly 90-minute keynote address that saw top company executives show off a slew of new updates for major products.\n\nKey announcements made by the American technology giant included software for iPhone, Mac, iPad, Watch and Apple TV, new health features, and updates to Siri, AirPods, and iCloud. In addition to these, Apple unveiled new updates focused on tightening the protection of its users\u2019 privacy.\n\nA particular update that stood out from Apple\u2019s several privacy-focused measures is \u201cPrivate Relay\u201d. This new feature encrypts all browsing history and prevents third parties from intercepting the communication between your device and the server you\u2019re requesting information from. When turned on, nobody can track a user\u2019s online activity \u2013 not even the internet service provider or Apple itself. This is due to the fact that the feature uses a server maintained by a third-party operator, which will assign temporary IP addresses for users as they browse the internet.\n\nApple\u2019s use of an outside party in the relay system is intentional to prevent even the company from knowing both the user\u2019s identity and what website the user is visiting, it explained.\n\nPrivate relay is the latest in a string of efforts by Apple meant to curb the tracking of its users\u2019 browsing activity by ISPs, advertisers, and other third parties. The feature is likely to go live later this year but Apple has revealed that it won\u2019t be available in some countries due to \u201cregulatory reasons\u201d.\n\nCountries where the company will not offer private relay include South Africa, Egypt, Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, the Philippines and China. In the latter, users live under a vast surveillance system and notorious internet censorship, and Apple has had to make several compromises on privacy to meet the demands of the ruling Communist party.\n\nIt is unsurprising to see African countries on the list of nations excluded from the private relay rollout as cutting off access to the internet and social media is common in the region. A report by privacy protection company Surfshark shows that at least 27 countries in Africa have blocked or heavily restricted social media access since 2015.\n\nLike China, those excluded by Apple have in place some kind of internet censorship regulating their citizens\u2019 online activities \u2013 often in the form of laws guiding against misinformation, hate speech, or cybercrimes \u2013 or have outrightly blocked access to social media and the internet in recent times.\n\nThe Egyptian government in particular has one of the most extensive surveillance networks in Africa and has ordered the blocking of hundreds of websites that belong to news outlets, blogs, human rights organisations, and tools such as virtual private networks used to bypass the blockades.\n\nApple is yet to disclose the outside partners it will use for the private relay system. The company also did not specify if the update will be blocked by internet providers in the countries where the feature is restricted or will simply be excluded from system upgrades for users there.",

          "title": "Exposure to risk: What tech investors fear and find interesting about Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban",
          "text": "For the second time in six months, a major government announcement is causing startup founders and investors to ponder the effect of politics and sudden regulation on doing business in Nigeria.\n\nIn February, it was the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. This time it is the ban on Twitter, a social media platform that has been used for everything from crowdsourcing pro-bono lawyers for people in distress and finding missing persons, to raising capital.\n\nOn January 11 this year, the Cowrywise team received a direct message from Sahil Lavingia, a tech entrepreneur and angel investor from Silicon Valley. He had learned about the savings and wealth management startup and wanted to invest, so he reached out the best way he could \u2013 via Twitter.\n\nTwo weeks and two days later, Cowrywise closed a $3 million pre-seed round. It was led by Quona Capital, a multinational investment firm, with Lavingia and other investors participating.\n\n\u201cThe power of Twitter,\u201d Lavingia declared after the announcement.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this DM was just perfect\u2026\u201d Razaq Ahmed, Cowrywise\u2019s CEO, said.\n\nIn a different decade, startup fundraising in Africa involved long-distance travels. Primed by stories of fake companies and phantom Nigerian princes, investors needed to physically verify business authenticity, assess startup-investor chemistry and speak to customers.\n\nIn 2021, investing in Nigeria can take one DM. But this ease and perfection is now under threat.\n\nOne less medium for investor contact\n\nAfter the government ban on Twitter last week, a number of startups are anxious about using the platform.\n\nMost have suspended customer support on Twitter, while some have disclaimed that their accounts are operated outside Nigeria.\n\nThe anxiety around the ban has gotten to the international community of startup investors too.\n\nAs providers of capital, investors influence the pace and scale of innovation. Often, their decision to do so is based on perceptions about the business environment. What are they feeling and fearing about Nigeria now?\n\nIdo Sum, a partner at TLCom Capital, says the ban \u201cmay put a dampener on some foreign investments for tech companies in the short term but this is unlikely to be sustained.\u201d\n\nNigeria grabs attention for being the most populous country in Africa, with 200 million people. That number doesn\u2019t necessarily speak to the opportunity size for every startup; after all, the country\u2019s 40% poverty rate is the highest in the world.\n\n\n\nBut 81% of the country\u2019s 106 million adults have mobile phones and broadband penetration is at 40.6% \u2013 a vast improvement from 19.69% in June 2017. A growing supply of high-quality tech entrepreneurs, including from former employees of startups like Paystack and Andela, is fuelling the rise of more startups each year.\n\nSum, whose firm has invested in uLesson, Okra and Terragon among others, believes investors will continue to focus on this trend.\n\nAs the general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures, Satoshi Shinada is constantly watching the 89 companies they have invested in across 11 countries. He\u2019s had to pay particular attention to their Nigeria portfolio \u2013 which includes Decagon, Lifestores Pharmacy, Bamboo and BuyCoins \u2013 following a flurry of regulatory actions this year.\n\n\u201cI think the ban on Twitter will definitely affect investor sentiments and perception about Nigeria negatively, especially foreign investors who invest in Nigeria remotely,\u201d Shinada says.\n\nAs he describes it, Twitter has been a medium for such investors to establish contacts and engage in conversations that illuminate the market opportunity in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, he thinks that the impact will be minimal. With Nigerians finding alternative paths to retain access to Twitter, it shows that the market is resilient, keeping the investment corridor open for business.\n\nTwo other tech investors who spoke to TechCabal largely agreed with this view of the Twitter ban\u2019s possible effect on foreign investments into tech startups.\n\nFive days after internet service providers turned off the Twitter switch, the site is still being accessed through VPNs. Therefore, DMs remain open for communication between prospective investors and founding teams. It helps that such chats are never public unless one party divulges conversation history.\n\nBut even in terms of communication, other avenues exist. Email and then WhatsApp remain the major channels for hashing out term sheet details, one investor said. Zoom calls and regular phone conversations still work.\n\nMore discount on regulatory risk\n\nOne area of investment concern following the Twitter ban is \u201ca higher sense of political and regulatory risk,\u201d where unilateral decisions can put whole companies in jeopardy.\n\nBeyond assessing Nigerian startups on market size and tech gadgets penetration, there will now be a need to put a lot more discount on potential returns by taking political risk into account.\n\nBut if investors have to put a lot more political-risk discount on potential returns, would that not increase their scepticism to invest in the first place?\n\nIt would, for firms who find that the adjusted returns do not fit their investment strategy. Where a firm sets its Internal Rate of Return at 40% and gets 20% after factoring in these risks, it would be inclined to decline such opportunities.\n\nWhat that does is that an investor served with a similar opportunity in a lower-risk market, say Ghana, may likely fund the Ghanaian startup instead.\n\nThat said, investors who write million-dollar tickets and have taken a long-term view of their play in Nigeria will likely not be turned off by such discounts.\n\n\u201cFor investors like ourselves who are focused on Africa for the long term, this has no effect, and we hope that this will be the case for non Africa based investors as well, who will keep seeing the great long term potential and upside and keep increasing their exposure to the African tech ecosystem,\u201d says Sum, the TLCom Capital partner.\n\nHe also hopes that the Nigerian government will realise that bans have not worked and seek collaborations and partnerships with the \u201cvery influential\u201d tech community as a path forward.",

          "title": "Femi Iromini is improving the employability of students in Nigeria",
          "text": "Femi Iromini has been active in the African tech ecosystem for the past 5 years. As a young student, he ran many businesses\u2014 at one point, he performed due diligence for foreign investors looking to invest in African startups. Now he\u2019s focused on improving the Nigerian education system and the employability of Nigerian graduates.\n\nTo understand how he got here, let\u2019s look at his life\u2019s journey.\n\nReading Gifted Hands by Ben Carson at an early age sparked Iromini\u2019s interest in medicine. This interest was also encouraged by his secondary school teachers. He was the best student in chemistry, physics and maths so naturally, they all thought he would do well to study medicine.\n\nHe secured admission into the university and had begun studying medicine for some months before his father pulled him out of school.\n\n\u201cHe just told me that he didn\u2019t think the school was meant for me,\u201d Iromini told me.\n\nFortunately, Iromini got into university at a young age so taking an involuntary gap year wasn\u2019t too big a deal.\n\nSwitching to Geophysics\n\nIromini\u2019s switch to geophysics is a story that many may relate with. It involves a rich uncle and a desire to be as rich as the said uncle.\n\nOne day, while he was at home, this uncle came around. As they played chess, Iromini asked him what he did for a living. He worked with the oil company ExxonMobil and he had studied geophysics.\n\nIromini recalled, \u201cWhen my uncle mentioned geophysics, I thought to myself, \u2018This must be God speaking to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the career prospects of geophysics looking promising, he decided to study geophysics.\n\nA year into studying geophysics at Obafemi Awolowo University, he started questioning whether he had made the right choice.\n\nThe answer to that question came during a field trip to Ekiti. The students and lecturer had gone out to identify some rocks and minerals.\n\n\u201cDuring this field trip, a professor leading the delegates carried a boulder. I could see he was passionate about it. He then said if you really want to succeed as a geologist you need to fall in love with rocks. You need to romance rocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was at the back, watching and listening. I didn\u2019t find that appealing. I told myself there are better things in life to romance than rocks.\u201d\n\nNone of his lecturers back at school were passionate about rocks and they didn\u2019t answer field questions with certainty. By the end of the trip, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to end up in a career related to geophysics.\n\nThat trip became a turning point for him and pushed him to attend a variety of non-academic events. He got into a number of social impact and entrepreneurial programs like the One Young World, Goldman Sachs Program, World Business Dialogue and Global University Initiative. These programs expanded his mind and opened him up to a world of possibilities.\n\nContributing to society through business\n\nDuring one of these programs, his life took a turn after Nelson Mandela charged him and other participants to focus on changing Africa by looking for ways to contribute.\n\nHe returned from the program and started businesses in school. He opened a laundry business and restaurants on three campuses. He also started a social enterprise that helped students get internships.\n\nAs he built these businesses, other students supported him. Back then, he didn\u2019t know anything about financing. He just wrote a letter soliciting contributions from his peers and they showed up. He bought his first washing machine after a \u20a620,000 ($125 at the time) contribution came in from another student.\n\nDespite the initial support he was fortunate enough to receive, he realised it was difficult to get the additional financial support he needed to build his businesses. The traditional funding channels weren\u2019t a viable option because the business didn\u2019t have a track record.\n\nDuring this phase he stumbled on Kickstarter \u2013 a crowdfunding platform. At the time, it was a new idea that opened up his mind to the concept that people can leverage their social capital to raise funds. His businesses thrived because other people believed and supported him, so he wanted to build a similar platform for others around him to raise funds.\n\nTo build this platform he collaborated with some Indian engineers he met during a program he attended years before. Building the platform took longer than expected and he spent more money than he planned to.\n\nTo increase the pace of development, he learnt a bit of coding and joined in building the platform.\n\nEventually, Crowdy, a platform that helped people in his community raise funds from family and friends, was launched. Its fundraising process was similar to the rolling fund investment model.\n\nIn 2014, fresh out of school and still running the Crowdy platform, he was approached by AXA Venture Partners, they needed help in deal analysis and sourcing for African startups.\n\n\u201cThey were looking to invest in Africa, but they weren\u2019t sure about the numbers. With Crowdy we were able to aggregate startups, especially in East Africa for them. We were more like deal aggregators.\u201d\n\nIromini and his team at Crowdy helped conduct due diligence on the startups they referred to AXA Venture Partners, they were paid for the consulting services they offered.\n\nWhile at Crowdy, Iromini also partnered with the cofounding team for the first few months of the formation of agritech company Farmcrowdy.\n\nPreparing students for employment\n\nIn 2013, while still running Crowder he enrolled in an post graduate program in innovation and entrepreneurship at Stanford University. During the program, he spent a lot of time around the Stanford campus and other neighbouring universities. He noticed a common denominator that was missing back home. In every university, there was a career center. The schools were intentional about preparing students for the world of employment.\n\nComparing this approach with his undergraduate days where there was no structure around preparing students for employment, he decided to do something about this problem.\n\n\u201cUniversities should be thinking about career outcomes. How many [of their] graduates are employed, unemployed or furthering their education. Career outcomes are a selling proposition for universities,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nThis led to the creation of Lead 360, an education technology company. The company has worked with a number of public and private universities like Covenant University and Afe Babalola.\n\nBased on the few engagements Lead 360 had with these universities, they learned that it\u2019s more than just establishing a career centre in these schools. Making students more employable requires a step by step approach.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s typically found is that in many of these schools, in the final year, a one-week seminar on employability will be organised. You\u2019re meant to have a career advisor whose performance is based on the successful employment of students. Someone who helps with internships, reviewing CVs and evaluating the interests of students,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nAs opposed to engaging with governments and universities directly, Lead 360 has adjusted its model to focus on working with institutions like the World Bank and the International Labour Organisation first, then using them to engage with the governments and universities. It has proven to be more effective.\n\nThey\u2019ve successfully collaboration with the state governments and corporate organisations to develop over 40 digital centres like one in Makoko, Yaba, Lagos.\n\nLead 360 is working on a few projects right now. Top on the list is a labour market information system. A system that informs the government and universities on what skillsets employers are looking for and how many students have these skillsets in real time. This project is funded by international agencies.\n\nIt also has other solutions for students like career services, a learning management system, a transcript management system, and an education financing product.\n\nAs someone who has always sought to solve problems around him, Iromini is taking the Nigerian education system heads on.\n\nBy 2050, Africa is going to have a large population with Nigeria at the forefront, he is constantly asking himself, \u201cwhat are we going to do with this population?\u201d",

The company recently introduced Risk Score\u2014a game-changing feature that enables copiers to choose Master Traders based on the risk of their trading strategy.\n\nOctaFX Copytrading is a top-rated service among the company\u2019s clients. There are two great reasons for its popularity. First, you can access the service with just one tap through the OctaFX Copytrading app or the desktop version. Second, you need zero Forex expertise to start making a profit.\n\nWondering how it works? The clients, known as copiers, choose professional traders, known as Master Traders, to copy their trades. Whenever a Master Trader opens an order, the same order opens in a copier\u2019s account automatically. That way, a copier can simply trust a Master Trader\u2019s expertise and profit with minimum effort.\n\nHowever, it is important to choose a Master Trader wisely and invest your funds securely. For this reason, OctaFX offers a Master Rating, where the best traders are placed at the top. Previously, they were evaluated only by their profitability and popularity. Now OctaFX took it to the next level.\n\nOctaFX Copytrading introduced Risk Score\u2014a new feature that shows how risky each Master Trader\u2019s strategy is. The score is calculated by a special algorithm and depends on a Master Trader\u2019s average profit, number of orders, and how stable their strategy is. The introduction of Risk Score is fundamental because copiers can now choose a Master Trader based not only on their profit but also on their strategy. Master Traders who score 1 or 2 on a 6-point scale apply more stable, long-term oriented, and less risky strategies.\n\nOctaFX hopes that with this new feature, their copy trading clients will be able to choose Master Traders who best suit their preferences.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2021 \u2018Best Forex Broker Asia\u2019 award and the 2020 \u2018Most Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely offered more people access to the global financial system \u2014 but African consumers have repeatedly told us that Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be way too expensive to use in many cases, and it is therefore, not necessarily the answer for the financial needs of all communities. More African Bitcoin and Ethereum users are increasingly using other cryptocurrencies which offer better value for money\u201d\n\nOnuoha added: \u201cIn response to consumer demand, we are solely focused on the ease of sending and receiving value through cryptocurrency using the most affordable means. Our vision is to bring Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to low and middle income countries where remittances account for 5% or more of GDP and make these DeFi services more accessible.\u201d\n\nThe threshold for sending and receiving money using crypto on EasyShare.Africa is capped at a maximum of US$2,500 per transaction and a minimum of US$1. Users can seamlessly send money to a mobile wallet or bank account using crypto in five easy steps. EasyShare.Africa supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT ERC20) and other low transaction cost cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT TRC20) and Tron (TRX). More cryptocurrency options will be added in due course.\n\nThe Easyshare.Africa platform is crowdsourcing to meet its expansion plans\n\nIn addition to serving ordinary consumers, Easyshare.Africa is committed to extending its impact, by pioneering the world\u2019s first decentralized network of verified peer to peer crypto-powered remittance agents. Current crypto remittance systems and peer to peer platforms use centralized escrows to guarantee settlement. This centralized escrow model is oftentimes plagued with bad actors, as well as centralized judges and juries settling disputes.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing\n\nNigeria\u2019s information minister\u2019s invitation for questioning over Twitter ban\n\nNigerian Uber and Bolt drivers\u2019 partnership with local ride-hailing companies\n\nBolt\u2019s electric tuk-tuks and e-bikes in Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s information minister invited for questioning over Twitter ban\n\nIn yet another twist to Nigeria\u2019s Twitter saga in Nigeria, the House of Representatives has invited the Minister for Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to brief the house over the ban on the social network.\n\nThis is coming after widespread criticism by citizens over lawmakers\u2019 silence since the ban was announced. We even had some lawyers discuss the legality of the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the resumption of plenary duties, the House set up a Committee on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nWhat has been said? The speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, ordered the Committee to investigate the legality of the Federal Government\u2019s ban and report to the house within 10 days.\n\nHe noted that the legislative body recognised the value of social media as a tool for communication and commerce in the country but insisted that it must be balanced with the need to protect national interests.\n\nExternal pressure? Various bodies, including High Commissions and Embassies of foreign nations spoke out against the Twitter ban. However, this is the first response by the country\u2019s lawmakers.\n\nUber and Bolt drivers set to partner with local companies\n\nFighting back? The National President, Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA), Mr Idris Shonuga, has announced plans by members of the body to ditch Uber and Bolt in favor of local companies, Active Rides and My Cab App.\n\nThe drivers hope that this new arrangement would improve their welfare and customer service while giving the Association a greater say in decisions affecting its members.\n\nRecall that in April 2021, riders on Uber and Bolt drivers embarked on a week long warning strike. They called on the ride-hailing companies to review prices in line with increased living expenses in the country.\n\nUber responded with a 13% price hike for its UberX offering. However, it appears that the drivers remain dissatisfied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe not enough: While it seems drivers are getting improved conditions with this new arrangement, it is not yet clear how the Association\u2019s plan to partner with the local ride-hailing companies would play out. Its success would most likely hinge on users\u2019 adoption of the two partners which are relatively unknown.\n\nGo deeper with this article: Uber, Bolt drivers move to dump ride hailing companies, partner with indigenous firms\n\nBolt unveils electric tuk-tuks in Kenya\n\nBolt Foods electric motorcycles.

          "title": "Global EV adoption: The reality in Africa may be different",
          "text": "A decade ago, the notion that Electric Vehicles (EVs) could be an alternative to the popular gas vehicles was unthinkable. Then, electric vehicles were more for research & development projects and the few that roamed the roads were so expensive that they were exclusive to the rich.\n\nHowever, thanks to technological advancements, evolving policies and the growing popularity of EV companies like Jet Motor Company, EVs are now sharing the same roads with conventional vehicles. And some regions already perceived it as the future of transportation.\n\nAccording to reports, the adoption of EVs across the globe is rapidly gaining steam. It is estimated that adoption has increased more than six-fold since 2015.\n\nLast year, over 11 million registered electric vehicles including cars, buses, vans and trucks were on the road across the world. This number is projected to rise to 145 million by the end of the decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe number of different EV car models available in the market has risen to 370\n\nIn terms of sales, the past year was similarly a ground-breaking one for EVs. Sales grew globally by 41% in 2020 despite the 16% pandemic related drop in overall car sales across the world.\n\nEurope overtook China as the centre of the global electric car market for the first time. The region saw electric car sales of 3 million, with registrations doubling to 1.4 million, while in China\u2019s increased to 1.2 million.\n\nChina has been the world\u2019s largest market since 2015. It has almost five million EVs, accounting for more than half of the world\u2019s total, according to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security.\n\nThe US and Africa still lag in the transition to EVs. However, while the world\u2019s biggest economy has started adopting measures that would benefit the adoption soon, Africa has shown little progress.\n\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) says the huge gap in adoption between regions is related to the level of the challenges affecting the EVs growth.\n\nEVs Challenges in Africa\n\nElectric vehicles remain rare in most of Africa, the probability of finding one is about one in a million. In South Africa, which is thought to be the largest EV market on the continent, only 1,000 out of more than 12 million vehicles on its roads are EVs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven fewer electric cars are in operation in most other African countries. This is because the most popular vehicles are second-hand cars.\n\nReports estimated that about 40% of the global exports of used vehicles go to Africa. Specifically, in Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia it is estimated that the proportion reaches about 80\u201390% of total vehicles imported.\n\nGovernment Policies\n\nHowever, this might not change soon. Unlike Europe where government policies are forcing automotive markets to embrace more climate-friendly options like Evs, Africa\u2019s governments are more relaxed.\n\nOnly one African country, Cape Verde, has taken steps to phase out the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by targeting an end to imports of such vehicles by 2035.\n\nIn comparison, about 17 countries have made similar laws across Asia, Europe and America. In addition to that, many of the countries pledge to SDGs net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPoor Infrastructure \u2013 Roads, Electricity, EV chargers\n\nSecondly, even the relatively slow adoption of EVs in Africa faces infrastructural challenges like weak electricity grids, Bad roads and lack of public E-chargers.\n\nWhile grids in Europe have been able to cope with electric mobility, electricity systems in many African countries are already under strain. Frequent blackouts in some countries could limit consumer demand for electric cars, as it cuts off access to transport.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, the average access to electricity is about 12 hours and there are no known public EV charging stations in the country.\n\nThings are a bit better in SouthAfrica. The country is ranked fifth globally in the ratio of public electric vehicle (EV) chargers to electric vehicles in 2020. Only Korea, Chile, Mexico, and the Netherlands have more chargers per EV.\n\nHowever, that is just one out of 54 countries that are on the continent.\n\nInsufficient charging infrastructure continues to prevent wider use, as does the low supply of appropriate electric vehicles in many sectors, such as heavy industry.\n\nLess than the average cost of living\n\nThe cost of EVs have dropped drastically over the years, the advancement in Battery Technology and the huge investment in EV startups have made buying an EV affordable.\n\nHowever, despite falling battery costs, the promise of savings over the lifetime of an EV from lower fuel and maintenance costs, the upfront prices remain out of the range of average Africa.\n\nAccording to Cox Automotive, the average cost of a new electric vehicle is about $55,600 (N23M). This is way above the average yearly salary of N2M made by the average Nigerian living in Lagos.\n\nA local solution\n\nDespite the many problems plaguing the adoption of EVs in Africa, A handful of startups and companies in several countries are building electronic vehicles to push adoption within the continent.\n\nThese companies are finally bringing the electric-car revolution to the streets of Africa with the production of electric-vehicle fleets of light carriers and motorcycles\u2014vehicles well suited for the continent\u2019s challenging roads.\n\nWith smart technologies and appropriate regulation, these EVs could become an asset rather than a threat to grid stability, through dynamic charging and vehicle-to-grid applications.\n\nWhile electricity systems in many African countries are currently limited, they are expanding fast: power generation capacity is expected to more than double by 2040.\n\nAfrica has the smallest per-capita car ownership level of any region in the world. Transportation using buses, taxis and motorcycles are more popular than personal cars, this shows that it may be better suited to electrification first.\n\nIn addition, the shift to transport electrification will be far easier to manage if it is factored into grid upgrades at an early stage, instead of taking grid operators by surprise further down the line to consumers.\n\nSome examples of these startups are Kenya-based ARC Ride launched electric two- and three-wheelers for UberEats deliveries in Nairobi. In Kigali, Rwandan start-up Ampersand is introducing a fleet of electric motorcycle taxis and plans to expand to other East African countries.\n\nIn Uganda, locally manufactured electric buses from Kiira Motors have started transporting passengers in Kampala. Finally in Nigeria, Jet Motor Company has partnered with GIG Logistics to provide its EVs for both transport and logistics services in the Nigerian market.\n\nIn Summary\n\nWhile progress is being made, electric cars currently make up 1% of the global fleet. And significant barriers to the wholesale adoption of EVs remain. The report predicts that with even bolder climate programmes and emission reduction targets, there could be up to 230 million electric vehicles on our streets \u2013 12% of all road transport \u2013 by 2030.\n\nSimilarly in Africa, SDG scenarios are predicting around 40% of light vehicles in Africa are electric by 2050.\n\nWith market forces gaining momentum, consumer consciousness on the rise and the emergence of Local EV companies this forecast is not impossible.\n\nHowever, for Africa to become a fast-growing source of demand for electric transport, governments and investors need to support these innovations to scale up and accelerate adoption.",

          "title": "UPDATED: JUSUN suspends two-month-old strike",
          "text": "The Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (NJC) on Wednesday suspended its nationwide strike which paralysed the Nigerian courts for over two months.\n\nMembers of the union had embarked on the strike on April 6 to press home their demand for the financial autonomy of the judiciary.\n\nThe 64-day-old strike is the longest industrial action the Nigerian judiciary, as a whole, has ever seen. The closest to it which members of the union embarked on in January 2015 for the same reason only lasted for two weeks.\n\nJUSUN took the decision suspending the strike at a meeting of its National Executive Committee (NEC) in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nThe union announced the suspension of the strike in a communique issued at the end of the NEC meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIt cited the intervention of the National Judicial Council (NJC) and other stakeholders in reaching the decision to suspend the strike.\n\n\u201cNEC-in-session discussed extensively and after putting so many issues into consideration i.e. the intervention of the NJC and other stakeholders, the NEC has resolved that the strike is hereby suspended,\u201d the signed by the union\u2019s Deputy President, Emmanuel Abioye, and General Secretary, Isiah Adetola, read in part.\n\nJUSUN had convened the NEC meeting following an appeal by the National Judicial Council (NJC) to the union to call off the nationwide strike in the interest of the nation.\n\nThe NJC led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Muhammed, had made the appeal to the union at a meeting earlier on Tuesday.\n\nDemands\n\nThe union which commended the CJN, state Chief Judges, and other stakeholders for their efforts in ensuring the resolution of the crisis, also sought the protection of its members from persecution and \u201cpeculiar allowance\u201d for its members.\n\n\u201cNEC-in-session agreed that there shall be introduction of peculiar allowance throughout the state and federal courts,\u201d the union stated in its communique.\n\n\u201cNEC-in-session unanimously reiterated that no member of JUSUN should be victimised on strike action,\u201d it added.\n\nMatter not yet laid to rest\n\nThere are indications that the union took the decision to call off the strike on Wednesday despite that its demand for the implementation of the agreement it signed with the state governors on financial autonomy of the state judiciaries had yet to begin.\n\nIn broad sense, the union\u2019s demand is for compliance with constitutional provision which places the state judiciaries\u2019 budgets on the first line charge, a status that enables them to receive their funds directly from the federation account.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had last year signed the Executive Order 10 for the enforcement of the constitutional provision. The 36 state governors had kicked against the executive order.\n\nBut PREMIUM TIMES reported how the union, in May, signed a Memorandum of Action (MoA) with the governors on how to ensure the full implementation of constitutional provision.\n\nMajor highlights of the MoA include a provision that the \u201crespective states shall credit the accounts of each State House of Assembly and each state judiciary with the pro-rata amount due each of the two arms of government under the 2021 Appropriation for each state.\u201d\n\nBut the implementation had yet to begin as of Wednesday when the union suspended its strike.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTherefore, the union in its communique issued at the end of its Wednesday\u2019s meeting pleaded with \u201cthe NJC, the Presidential Implementation Committee, Attorney-General of the Federation, Accountant-General of the Federation, and all stakeholders to see that the issue of judiciary financial autonomy is laid to rest finally as provided in section 81(3), 121(3), and 162(9) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\u201d\n\nIt \u201ccondemns the actions of the Governors of Kaduna, Plateau and Benue states for withholding salaries of judiciary in their various states for months and urge all governors involved to do the needful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEC-in-session agreed that there shall be introduction of peculiar allowance throughout the State and Federal Courts.\n\nThe union also said it kicked against what it described as \u201cthe deduction of salary of JUSUN members of Bayelsa State.\u201d It demanded that \u201cthe deducted sum be restored forthwith.\u201d\n\n\u2018NJC advised JUSUN to call off strike\u2019\n\nThe NJC had said in an earlier statement that it had advised JUSUN to call off its over-two-month-old strike.\n\nThis came after the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, on Tuesday, directed the workers to return to work, threatening that the government might be forced to invoke \u201csections of the Trade Disputes Acts\u201d if the strike persisted longer.\n\nThe NJC said in a statement on Wednesday that it advised JUSUN to call off the strike during an emergency meeting it held with the leadership of the union on Tuesday.\n\nSoji Oye, NJC\u2019s Director of Information, said in a statement on Wednesday, that the meeting held under the chairmanship of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (NJC), Tanko Muhammad.\n\nThe meeting, according to Mr Oye, was attended by the Chief Judges of states, the JUSUN executive members as well as Senator Ita Enang, who is the Senior Special Adviser to the President and Secretary of the Implementation Committee.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES had reported that the meeting was summoned by the CJN, who doubles as the chairman of the NJC, in a bid to find a lasting solution to the lingering strike.\n\nThe workers have been on strike since April 6 in agitation for the financial independence of the judiciary. The strike has now led to the shutdown of Nigerian courts for over two months.\n\nSeries of meetings have been held between the leaders of the union and the labour minister, Chris Ngige, who is leads the federal government\u2019s negotiation team regarding the financial autonomy status of the state judiciaries and Houses of Assembly.\n\nThe JUSUN leaders\u2019 meeting with the NJC on Tuesday is the latest in the series of such reconciliatory meetings that that have been convened since April to resolve the lingering industrial crisis.\n\nGiving an update on the outcome of the meeting on Wednesday, Mr Oye said the council received briefings from the CJN and executives of JUSUN led by Emmanuel Abioye, who is the union\u2019s Deputy President.\n\n\u201cAt the end of deliberations, Council advised JUSUN to consider suspending the strike in the interest of Administration of Justice and National interest,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nNJC sets up monitoring committee\n\nThe statement also said the NJC set up a committee to monitor the implementation of the agreement on the judiciary\u2019s financial autonomy which the union signed with the state governors.\n\n\u201cThe council thereafter set up a five-man committee in order to monitor the implementation of the Memorandum of Action signed between the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and JUSUN,\u201d the statement added.\n\nCJN\u2019s briefing\n\nMr Oye said on Wednesday that the council received briefing from the CJN who was said to have lamented the negative impact of the strike on the nation at large.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Justice of Nigeria and other stakeholders during the interface, lamented that the strike had affected the judiciary in particular and the nation at large and therefore sought for a way to resolve the lingering issue,\u201d the statement read.\n\nJUSUN\u2019s grouse\n\nAccording to the NJC\u2019s statement, Mr Abiri, JUSUN\u2019s Deputy President of JUSUN, blamed the problem on state governors whom they said have refused to obey constitutional provisional provisions on the financial autonomy of the judiciary.\n\nMr Abioye explained that \u201cdespite the constitutional provision of sections 81 (3), 121 (3), 162 (9) and the judgement delivered since 2015 in favour of JUSUN, the Executive Order 10 of 2020 and the agreement reached between the Union, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, the governors have refused to yield financial autonomy to the state judiciary.\u201d\n\nHe added that the union\u2019s other grievances include, \u201cnon-payment of peculiar allowance for judiciary staff; attempt by the Kaduna State governor to place the State Judiciary under its civil service and scheming for a state judicial council.\u201d\n\nReferencing the agreement the union recently signed with the governors, Mr Abioye said, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) \u201cwas merely playing politics with the constitution and had also failed to remit the one-month payment agreed on at the end of May as a demonstration of their good faith.\u201d\n\nMr Abioye said the NGF could renege in fulfilling its promise at the end of the month of May, adding that there was no guarantee that it would not in June. He therefore requested that the Accountant-General of the Federation be directed to deduct from source the amount meant for the Judiciary before the Union could call off the strike.",

          "text": "The federal government has listed some conditions to lift the suspension on Twitter operations in Nigeria, saying it must now be registered in Nigeria as a business concern.\n\nApart from Twitter, the government said other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram must be registered in the country.\n\nMinister of Information, Lai Mohammed, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the virtual federal executive council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to him,Twitter has reached out to the federal government seeking high-level discussion to resolve the issue saying that he got the message on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe insisted that the microblogging platform was suspended because it provided an avenue for people that are threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the owner of Twitter helped to fund the recent #EndSARS protest while allowing the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to use the platform to call for the killing of policemen.\n\nHe said Twitter failed to take down Kanu\u2019s tweets despite repeated requests to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cas you are aware, last Friday the federal government suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria indefinitely. And the reason we gave was because of the persistent use of the Twitter platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOn Friday, also the government directed the regulatory body, the National Broadcasting commission, to immediately commenced the process of licencing all OTT, Over The Top social media operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that you\u2019ve done that I think by today, that advert is out asking that all Ott, and social media coverage operating in Nigeria should apply for registration and licensing.\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that is because Twitter has consistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence that is the reason for suspending their operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBecause, we\u2019ve found out that Twitter is actually the platform of choice for a particular separatist leader who resides outside the country and issues directives to its members to attack symbols of government authority, such as the police, the military, the Electoral Commission offices, correctional centres, etc.\n\n\u201cAnd this is being done willfully and consistently without any consequences from Twitter. You know, no country worth its name will tolerate that. And no company, no matter its self importance will force any nation to accept this.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know that most of the Ott and social media platforms operating in Nigeria do not have any office in Nigeria and do not pay taxes to Nigerian government for the billions they earn here.\n\n\u201cThat is not the best practice globally, and that is why we are insisting that for you to operate in Nigeria you must first be a Nigerian company and be licenced by the broadcasting commission.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any Ott or social media platform operating in Nigeria must do so legally. One, registered with Corporate affairs Commission, the licence by National Broadcasting commission and then adhere to the conditions stipulated in their licences.\n\n\u201cWe have already advertised the notice to the companies concerned to apply for registration of licence.\u201d\n\nMohammed further explained that freedom of speech has not been stifled by the suspension of Twitter as he maintained that to Nigerians can still use other platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nHe also denied that the suspension is not effective arguing that that Twitter is losing money as a result of the action.\n\nHe stated, \u201cfor those that have heard that , the ban is not effective, to the best of my knowledge, I think the ban is very effective. Otherwise, how would they be complaining that they are losing billions of Naira everyday if the ban is not effective.\n\n\u201cBut that is not the issue. Many one of the commentators that have said suspending the operation of Twitter is like stifling freedom of expression. And I said no. Twitter is just one of the many platforms through which Nigerians can express themselves. There is Facebook, there is Instagram, there\u2019s WhatsApp. There\u2019s Google Hangout, and others. They have not been suspended.\n\n\u201cAnd in any case, like I have said in several fora, it is because we have a country called Nigeria that we can start talking about free speech. And of course, there has to be a country before people can able to transact their businesses using social media platforms.\n\n\u201cWhen I addressed you on Wednesday, I said, among other things that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect. And I went further to say yes that Twitter funded the Endsars protests in Nigeria last year.\n\n\u201cAnd people have challenged it. And I\u2019m glad that the Cable has done some fact finding and their conclusions are as follows: they said the truth is that, fact checking showed that indeed, Twitter played a prominent role in helping to raise funds for the endsars protesters.\n\n\u201cWhether they paid directly, helped to pay or helped to raise funds, it\u2019s a matter of semantics. And here is what the factcheck the online newspaper revealed: A, that on October 14 2020. \u2026.. retweeted an article about the protests with the endsars hashtag alongside a link to the feminist coalition, one of the groups providing support for the protesters at the time. B, that on the same date, he asked people to donate via bitcoins to support the movement. C, on October 16, Dussen launched a special emoji to give the protesters more visibility on the microblogging platform.\n\n\u201cSo, whether donated money himself or help to raise money, the tweeter owner is one of those who helped to fund the endsars protests that was later hijacked leading to loss of lives and massive destruction of property.\n\n\u201cWe must never forget the toll of the endsars protests. Six soldiers and several policemen were killed. Policemen were injured, vehicles were destroyed, 134 police stations were burnt down, 57 civilians were killed. 269 private corporate facilities were burnt or looter and vandalise, 243 government facilities were burnt or vandalized, 81 government warehouses were looted.\n\n\u201clike I said last Wednesday, you can see from the factcheck the role of Jack Dossy is suspect. His interest in Nigeria is inimical to our growth. Our decision to suspend Twitter has been lauded by some, it has been decried by some. But we want to make it clear that what is important to us is the sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd until when Twitter responds and the cardinal thing is that Twitter must be registered in Nigeria. Twitter must be licenced in Nigeria and Twitter must stop using its platform for activities that are inimical to the growth of Nigeria and its corporate existence,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "By Olawale Jokotoye\n\nFormer President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday dropped a critical message for those agitating for secession of Nigeria.\n\nObasanjo\u2019s message meant for Sunday Igboho, Nnamdi Kanu (IPOB), Prof. Banji Akintoye and others is that Nigerians would fair better staying together than break up.\n\nObasanjo stated this in Abeokuta at his investiture as a Fellow of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyor (NIS) organised by the Ogun chapter of the Body of Fellows of the NIS.\n\nThe elder statesman called on agitators for the disintegration of the country to shelve the idea and work for the oneness of the country.\n\nAccording to him, it is better for Nigeria to remain as one indivisible nation than for each tribe to go its separate way.\n\nThe former president, who acknowledged that Nigeria is passing through challenges, insisted that \u201cdisintegration is not the solution\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, any Nigerian who does not feel concerned about the challenges of the country is a human being without being human.\n\nHe said \u201cIt is better that Nigeria stays together and find solutions to its challenges than for each tribe to go its separate way.\n\n\u201cI am a strong believer of one Nigeria, but not one Nigeria at any cost, but one Nigeria where every Nigerian can feel proud that he or she has a stake in this country.\n\n\u201cThose of us who have shed part of our blood and sweat for this country, we did so because we wanted a country where every Nigerian can claim as his or her own.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we talk among ourselves the way we should and if we change the narrative, I believe this is a great country.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we are not making Nigeria what God wants it to be is not the fault of God, but our fault, particularly the leaders.\u201d\n\nObasanjo who noted that Nigeria\u2019s diversity remained a major source of its strength, explained that disintegration would result in \u201cweak republics\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne thing that gives us strength is our diversity. If all that we have is Republic of Oduduwa for those who say so, members of that country will be diminished compared to being a citizen of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cCitizens of Oduduwa Republic or any other republic borne out of Nigeria will be diminished compared to being citizens of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn this age and time that we are talking about the reintegration of Africa for economic development, disintegration of any country will be almost idiotic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former president wondered what would become of the over 300 minorities in Nigeria if the three major tribes went their separate ways.\n\n\u201cIf we have Igboland as an independent country, Yorubaland, an independent country and Fulani/Hausaland an independent country, where will the Jukuns or the Gbasama belong? The only reason they can raise up their heads is because they belong to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAre we thinking of them or are we are just being selfish? We should note that It doesn\u2019t matter what we do, we will still be neighbours. We had seen it before, India was broken into India and Pakistan, they are still at war till today. Yugoslavia was broken into different countries, they haven\u2019t sorted it till today.\n\n\u201cSudan was broken into Sudan and South Sudan, I don\u2019t believe South Sudan is better for it and that is the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe elder statesman who described Nigeria\u2019s challenges as correctable and surmountable, counselled that it would cost less for Nigerians to work together for the unity of the country than to break up and be perpetually in war against each other.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, we will be spending our money on building armies. I know what is involved in building and maintaining an army which may not necessarily be productive, let us think about it,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nFounder, Household of God Church International Ministries, Rev. Chris Okotie has come under fire after he attacked late Prophet T.B. Joshua, saying it was God\u2019s divine indignation that consumed him.\n\nOkotie has been a sworn enemy of Joshua while he was alive and even in death he released a dastard message to send him to the grave.\n\nThe controversial pastor had on his Instagram page on Tuesday quoted Hebrews 1:13, which said \u201c\u2026 Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.\u2019\n\nHe said T.B. Joshua was the wizard at Endor and that God had consumed him at last.\n\nHe said \u201cthe wizard at Endor who assumed the title \u2018Emmanuel,\u2019 has been consumed by divine indignation. And now his disciples bewail his ignominious exit.\n\n\u201cNo marvel, one third of God\u2019s angels followed the disgraced anointed cherub Lucifer!!\n\n\u201cJehovah-Jesus our mighty gladiator has broken the head of the dragon with his mighty blows. He has descended from the mountain of spices with the fiery sword of his indignation.\n\n\u201cGlorious in his apparel and traveling in the greatness of his strength, he goes conquering and to conquer the adversaries of his church.\n\n\u201cLet those who swear by the Lord and by Malcham and the descendants of Haman, now tremble in fear. The day of the vengeance of our God has fully come to Nigeria. And they shall not escape. Operation Hupopodion (footstool) has commenced. More Power To You !!!\u201d\n\nBut Nigerians have attacked Okotie for his cruel comment on Joshua.\n\nAccording to Emo Mark, \u201cAt least TB Joshua never jump from one wife to another. All I can say about TB Joshua was good, he was a friend to all, both the rich and the poor, friends to all religions, the way people reacted to his death show how great he was, who can say that about you?\u201d\n\nNellydon_n replied Okotie: \u201cYou just want to trend. So unfortunate you don\u2019t even have followers \u2026. what God will Judge in this world. Many pretend to be Rev, Pastors and whatever they call themselves but they are just wolves in human form\u2026\n\n\u201cFrom your write up, where is the Christianity in you? You rejoice for someone\u2019s death who has touched lives of many positively ? I pity you and your congregations cos, no doubt you are misleading them\u2026.\n\n\u201cFor your mind, you are CHRIST LIKE??? Repent and ask God for forgiveness and may God have mercy on you for such utterances\ud83d\ude4f If they call Reverends to come out now you will follow come out? Who ordained you Rev for the first time?\u201d\n\nFrizi Trilli added: \u201cIf your a preacher of the word, what does the Bible tell you of blasphemy? And who is to judge? If not God \u2026bet me you will meet your Waterloo soon, woe to those who mock the dead.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tolsaacworld1, \u201cBible says by their fruit we shall know them\u2026since ever I grown to know you there\u2019s nothing I can emulate in you as a Christian\u2026your lifestyle, the way you talk, your marital life, nothing a youth christian can talk take home from you\u2026\n\n\u201cYour life doesn\u2019t edify the true gospel of Christ but rather depopulate the kingdom of God\u2026if there\u2019s one thing I can say about you, you are one of the end time pastors that will be left after the rapture must have taken place as an instrument for anti-Christ by then all those you have misled will come back for you.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t understand deep things cos you are carnally filled also a strong demonic agent here on earth to deceive people in other to populate the kingdom of darkness\u2026T.b Joshua is God\u2019s general, God\u2019s Saint who came, saw and conquered.\n\n\u201cThou pharisees, Sadducee and high priest we all should be ready for 3 major surprises when we get to heaven. Those you all expect to see will not be there, those you didn\u2019t expect will be found in the right hand of God and you yourself will be amazed you finally made it\u2026.let\u2019s all wait for this day.\u201d\n\nCutestnenye stated: \u201cAt least we can remember that so called \u201cwizard for his good deeds to humanity, and his philanthropic ways, but you, what will you be remembered for? ASHAWOISM.\u201d\n\nFor Peaches_onyin, \u201cMay The vengeance Of Jehovah God, The Father Almighty visit you in Jesus name, Amen. If this is who you truly are, have no value to the kingdom of Jesus.\n\n\u201cRemove the man of God from your name and replace it with Agent of Lucifer. Because dat is what you just displayed for the whole world to see.\u201d",

We should not pay ransom. This is my personal opinion.\n\n\u201cI have said it before and I will say it again, if I am kidnapped, don\u2019t pay any ransom. Rather pray for me that if it is death, I go in a good way and if I am going to be released that I am not violated.\n\n\u201cAs long as we are giving them the money and they hurt people around, they will not change. Collectively, as a country we have to say no, we cannot continue to give them our hard earned money to buy weapons and drugs to kill and maim our children.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t put a stop to this, they will destroy us all. They will even kidnap the person that takes the ransom to them. You will see that some of them you even give them the ransom and they kill the person, so you have lost twice.\u201d\n\nN10m ransom on varsity lecturer\n\nMeanwhile, the abductors of a lecturer in the Department of Theatre Art, University of Jos, Mr. Dan Ella, have demanded a ransom of N10 million to secure his release.\n\nChairman Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) of the institution, Lazarus Maigoro, confirmed the development to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Wednesday in Jos.\n\nNAN reports that gunmen abducted Ella in the early hours of Wednesday at his residence, Haske Quarters, Lamingo community of Jos North local government area of Plateau state.\n\n\u201cThis is a sad development; gunmen coming after our members who are just average Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, the kidnappers have put a demand for a ransom of N10 million to secure his release,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ASUU chairman called on security agencies to intensify efforts to ensure the release of his colleague.\n\nHe also urged the personnel to be proactive in addressing the security challenges in the country.",

          "text": "Business development experts have identified lack of adequate knowledge and requisite skills in chosen fields as factors responsible for the untimely death of most startup businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThe experts pointed out that most small scale entrepreneurs in the country go into businesses without being armed with the basic fundamentals and rudiments of the business they want to invest in, and as such, when they run into trouble waters, they have swept away in the tide, losing all their investments in the process.\n\nSpeaking at a two-day workshop organized by She4She Initiative, a not-for-profit Non-Governmental Organization, NGO, established to develop, empower and support women and the girl-child to attain self-dependency and sufficiency, Mr Olalekan Brahim, a business coach and founder Centre for Learning, CfL, emphasized that Knowledge of the business is the first capital to acquire and not money.\n\nIbrahim maintained that the mistake most people make is to go for money first believing once they have money, they can go into any business they want.\n\nHe said, \u201cKnowledge is the first thing, not money. But the mistake people do is go for money first. When you have the knowledge, money becomes tools for you, but if you have money without knowledge you will waste the money.\u201d\n\nThe business coach noted that beyond whatever one might have heard about entrepreneurship as a means of doing business, there are still certain critical facts to consider entrepreneurship before venturing into it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard about entrepreneurship, we know it\u2019s doing business, but there are things we don\u2019t consider on entrepreneurship. We don\u2019t consider the problem first.\n\n\u201cMaybe you want to sell or render service, you have to realize it\u2019s problem you are trying to solve. Once you determine the problem, you will be able to know the solution. You have to understand the problem, the customer, once you know the problem you be able to determine those who are carrying the problem and you be able to understand how you can find solutions to it.\n\n\u201cOnce you are able to establish this, you will be able to do analysis: am I really ready for this business? Do I have the right knowledge, resources, tools to do this?\n\nThe CEO of Centre for Learning advised every startup business owner to ensure they attend a workshop like this one put together by She4She in order to take advantage of opportunities like this.\n\nAlso speaking on Mental health and fitness development, Dr. Yomi Jaiye, a life coach and the founder of CECY Health, emphasized on the need for participants to develop their mindset to improve their creativity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to talk about mental wellness because wealth is a mindset. If you are able to develop your thinking, you can create anything in the world without needing anybody\u2019s help take your life from the lowest point to the top.\n\nIn her remarks, the founder of She4She Initiative, Barr. Oyanbo Peace Owei, said the essence of the 2-day training for empowerment of women and girls was to be able to impact their lives and to support women and girls so they can have access to quality health care, good education, personal development.\n\nBarr. Owei said, \u201cIt\u2019s a personal development training for women and girls child to be able to build themselves. \u201cWe looked at the statistics of unemployed, poor and deprived women, and out of school girl-child, we decided that we can not just fold our arms. After the adverse effect of the Covid-19 pandemic we decided to stand up for women and that\u2019s where the theme \u201cWomen Up\u201d meaning women stand up for women was coined from.\n\n\u201cWe want to use our platform and wealth of knowledge to let people know what they need to know to develop themselves. We also want to give them awareness about various government programmes and plans that are available for women that can benefit them that they are not aware of. We want to take this advocacy upon ourselves. We want to create positive impact in our society.\u201d\n\nThe workshop had in attendance over 200 participants who were drawn from the online platforms, and were taught how to develop and improve their businesses.\n\nOne of the participants, Felicia Anita, said, \u201cI learnt about entrepreneurship and public speaking. There are some mistakes I used to make during resume writing that I got to know they were actually the wrong. I ended up providing a Solution to the problem I didn\u2019t know was there in the first place.\n\nAnother participant said, Mercy Mikel Ogwuche, said, \u201cThe speaker we had yesterday taught us about public speaking and it was so helpful. I also learnt about entrepreneurship on how to set up my own business, my vision, mission and how to have market policy. I have my own business already, this will help me take my business to another level.\u201d",

He, therefore, requested that the Accountant-General of the Federation be directed to deduct from source the amount meant for the Judiciary before the Union could call off the strike.",

Ndudi Elumelu the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the statement, the Joint Minority Caucus also dismissed threats by the APC-led government to arrest and prosecute Nigerians using Twitter and calls on Nigerians to go ahead and use their Twitter as they would not be contravening any law in Nigeria or any international statute.\n\nThe Joint Minority Caucus recognized the provisions of Articles 19 and 20 of the United Nations Charter on Fundamental Human Rights, which Nigeria is a signatory to, as well as provisions of Sections 39 and 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and notes that by these provisions no one will be violating any law for using Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nREAD ALSO: Suspension: FG Should Have Sued Twitter, Not Place A Ban \u2013 Falana\n\nAs lawmakers, the Joint Caucus said it is pained by the anguish Nigerians, especially the youths, who find the use of Twitter as a means of livelihood and genuine social interaction, are passing through just because the APC-led Federal Government feels slighted that an individual\u2019s post, was deleted by Twitter for ethic violation.\n\nThe joint caucus, therefore, called on Nigerians to use various opportunities offered by technology and continue making use of Twitter since such does not violate any law in our country.\n\n\u201cIt is agonizing that Nigeria and Nigerians have been losing billions of naira on daily basis since the ban on Twitter. This is completely unacceptable as it is worsening the already biting economic hardship and frightening unemployment level in the country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the ban on Twitter in Nigeria appears to be in favour of criminal and terrorist elements, whose activities fester in an environment of suppressed information flow.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Minority Caucus sympathizes with the organized private sector, manufacturing and service providing companies, small and medium enterprises, online business owners and other hardworking entrepreneurs across the country, whose genuine business and means of livelihood have been crippled by the unwarranted ban on Twitter by the APC federal government,\u201d the statement partly reads.\n\nThe caucus also identified with our students, research-based organization, media houses, the organized civil society, faith-based organizations, community groups among others, whose information-based activities have been violently disrupted by the ban.\n\nIn the same vein, the Joint Caucus sympathized with regional, states, local government as well as members of the international community, whose genuine and constructive activities have been crippled by the prohibition of twitter in Nigeria\n\nIt also identified with traditional rulers, who have even found Twitter as a means of communicating with the constituents, especially in this era of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe Joint Caucus vehemently berated the APC-led government for abandoning its duty of addressing the serious economic and security problems confronting our nation to rather focus on dissipating energy victimizing Nigerians over their disagreement with Twitter for deleting a post by an individual.\n\nThe Caucus counseled the Federal Government to swallow its pride, accept its misdoing and go and settle whatever issue it has with Twitter instead of this resort to inflicting pains on Nigerians.",

          "text": "The US will buy 500 million more doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to share through the global COVAX alliance for donation to 92 lower income countries and the African Union over the next year, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was set to make the announcement Thursday in a speech before the start of the Group of Seven summit.\n\nTwo hundred million doses \u2014 enough to fully protect 100 million people \u2014 would be shared this year, with the balance to be donated in the first half of 2022, the person said.\n\n\u201cWe have to end COVID-19 not just at home \u2014 which we\u2019re doing \u2014 but everywhere,\u201d Biden said Wednesday in a speech to the U.S. military at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, the first stop of an eight-day, three-country foreign trip.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Wednesday that Biden was committed to sharing vaccines because it was in the public health and strategic interests of the U.S.\n\nAs Biden embarks on his first foreign trip, he is aiming to show \u201cthat democracies are the countries that can best deliver solutions for people everywhere,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThe news of the Pfizer sharing plan was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the president\u2019s formal announcement. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nThe U.S. has faced mounting pressure to outline its global vaccine sharing plan. Inequities in supply around the world have become more pronounced, and the demand for shots in the U.S. \u2014 where nearly 64% of adults have received at least one dose \u2014 has dropped precipitously.\n\nLast week, the White House unveiled its plans to donate an initial allotment of 25 million doses of surplus vaccine overseas, mostly through the United Nations-backed COVAX program, promising infusions for South and Central America, Asia, Africa and others at a time of glaring shortages abroad.\n\nOverall, the White House has announced plans to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June, most through COVAX.\n\nOfficials say a quarter of the nation\u2019s excess will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the U.S. to share directly with allies and partners.\n\nThe White House has also directed doses to allies including South Korea, Taiwan and Ukraine.\n\nGlobal public health groups had been aiming to use the upcoming G-7 meetings in Cornwall, England, to press the nation\u2019s wealthiest democracies to do more to share vaccines with the world, and Biden\u2019s plans drew immediate praise toward that end.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s decision to purchase and donate additional COVID-19 vaccine doses is the kind of bold leadership that is needed to end this global pandemic,\u201d said Tom Hart, acting CEO at The ONE Campaign, a nonprofit that seeks to end poverty.\n\n\u201cThis action sends an incredibly powerful message about America\u2019s commitment to helping the world fight this pandemic and the immense power of US global leadership.\u201d\n\nBut others have called on the U.S. to do even more.\n\n\u201cCharity is not going to win the war against the coronavirus,\u201d said Niko Lusiani, Oxfam America\u2019s vaccine lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to let the world help itself. Rather than more lucrative transactions with very profitable pharmaceutical corporations, we need a transformation toward more distributed vaccine manufacturing so that qualified producers worldwide can produce billions more low-cost doses on their own terms, without intellectual property constraints.\u201d\n\nBiden last month broke with European allies to endorse waiving intellectual property rules at the World Trade Organization to promote vaccine production and equity.\n\nBut many in his own administration acknowledge that the restrictions were not the driving cause of the global vaccine shortage, which has more to do with limited manufacturing capacity and shortages of delicate raw materials.\n\nSullivan said Wednesday that he does not expect the U.S. push to waive the patents on vaccines to cause tension with European counterparts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all converging around the idea that we need to boost vaccine supply in a number of ways, sharing more of our own doses,\u201d Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have more to say on that, helping get more manufacturing capacity around the world.\u201d\n\nGlobally, there have been more than 3.7 million confirmed deaths from COVID-19, and more than 174 million people have been confirmed infected.",

          "text": "A leading civil society organization, Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) has reminded the federal government that Twitter and other social media platforms belong to the Information Communications sector which contributed 14.9 per cent to the 2021 first quarter (Q1) gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nCSJ, which expressed regret over the recent ban on the micro-blogging site by the federal government called for an immediate reversal of the action.\n\nIn a statement made available to THISDAY by its Lead Director, Eze Onyekpere, the group described the ban as a gross violation of Nigerians\u2019 human rights and economic obligations to respect already accrued economic and social rights.\n\nThe group urged the government to refrain from taking steps that will prevent Nigerians from accessing services provided by third parties which do not violate laws enacted by the respective legislatures.\n\nIt noted: \u201cThe contribution to aggregate real gross domestic product as at Quarter 1 of 2021 by the Information and Communications Sector where Twitter and other social media platforms belong is valued at 14.91%, being one of the largest contributors to the total output of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications sector is composed of the four activities of Telecommunications and Information Services; Publishing; Motion Picture, Sound Recording and Music Production; and Broadcasting.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that the Nigerian economy grew by less than 1%, specifically by 0.51% in Quarter 1 of 2021 and the contributions of the major sectors to aggregate real GDP is as follows: Oil sector accounted for 9.25%; the agriculture sector accounted for 22.35%; manufacturing was 9.93%; trade\u2019s contribution was 15.61%, construction was 4.12%, etc.\u201d\n\nCSJ observed that the overall growth pattern of the economy in the first quarter of 2021 was tepid and did not match population growth, adding that it failed to respond to stagflation \u2013 high unemployment, slow growth, inflation, and other macroeconomic challenges facing the nation.\n\nIt observed that the fact that Nigeria is just struggling to exit recession even compounds the scenario.\n\nAccording to CSJ, Twitter as part of social media platforms is a veritable medium for the outreach of enterprises in the Information Communications Technology (ICT) and other sectors, arguing that banning Twitter will retard investments, productivity, employment generation and the overall output and outcome of the economy.\n\nIt noted that the ban on Twitter at a time of great economic and social crisis has so many downsides without any evident upside.\n\nCSJ listed the downsides as increasing the cost of production of goods and service delivery as Twitter is a cheap means of driving traffic, advertisement in the ICT and other key sectors of the economy.\n\nAccording to the group, the ban will also retard the ease of doing business as many of its services will now be done through resource and time-consuming methods which will make the business environment inclement.\n\nCSJ further noted: \u201cIt will make more Nigerians especially the younger generation jobless at a time the official unemployment rate is 33.3% and the percentage of unemployed youths exceed the unemployment average of the overall population.\n\n\u201cIt will deter local and foreign investors who will see the country as undemocratic, without the rule of law and its due process where the ego, whims, and caprices of one man determines policy direction.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing that the federal government\u2019s action would worsen insecurity considering that unemployment contributes to crime, criminality, and the pervasive insecurity across the nation, it observed that the ban is a drag on information dissemination, and will provide an environment for compounding of criminality by state and non-state actors.\n\nCSJ therefore called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reconsider and lift the ban immediately to stop further irreparable damage to the Nigerian economy and to the economic and social rights of citizens.",

          "text": "One of the wives of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna state, Hajiya Asia El-Rufai, has declared that she would rather die than ransom be paid to kidnappers if she gets abducted.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday while addressing participants at a peace and security training, organized for women by Equal Access International (EAI), Mrs. El-Rufai aligned herself with the position of the governor who has consistently maintained that no ransom should be paid to bandits.\n\nMrs. El-Rufai said the solution to ending kidnapping is to stop payment of ransom.\n\nShe said she was ready to die in the hands of kidnappers if it will bring peace to the country.\n\nShe said Nigerians must get back their once peaceful country, noting that women have a great role to play in achieving that.\n\n\u201cWe must sacrifice to bring this (kidnapping) to an end. I am ready to die in the hands of kidnappers if it will bring peace to this country.\n\n\u201cFor as long as you continue to pay ransom, it is like you are adding kerosene to fire. You are giving bandits, kidnappers money for ammunition to continue to haunt you.\n\n\u201cWe should not pay ransom. This is my personal opinion. I have said it before and I will say it again, if I am kidnapped don\u2019t pay any ransom, rather pray for me that if it is death, I go in a good way and if I am going to be released that I am not violated,\u201dshe said.\n\nAccording to her, as long as the bandits are paid ransom, they will not change.\n\n\u201cCollectively as a country we have to say no, we can not continue to give them our hard earned money to buy weapons and drugs to kill and maim our children,\u201d the governor\u2019s wife said.\n\nMrs. El-Rufai said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t put a stop to this, they will destroy us all. They will even kidnap the person that takes the ransom to them.\n\n\u201cYou will see that some of them you even give the ransom and they still kill the person, so you have lost twice.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting on the recent communal clashes in parts of Kaduna state, the governor\u2019s wife urged women to shun divisive narratives created by selfish politicians and work for the unity of the state.\n\nIn his remarks, the Country Director of the EAI, Mr. Maaji Peters said the training was aimed at securing Nigerian communities through creation of Civilian Security (CIVSEC ) who will make contributions and decisions on issues that affects them and their communities.\n\nBy John Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "title": "US Drops Trump Order Targeting TikTok, Plans Its Own Review",
          "text": "The White House has dropped Trump-era executive orders intended to ban the popular apps TikTok and WeChat and will conduct its own review aimed at identifying national security risks with software applications tied to China, officials said Wednesday.\n\nA new executive order directs the Commerce Department to undertake what officials describe as an \u201cevidence-based\u201d analysis of transactions involving apps that are manufactured or supplied or controlled by China. Officials are particularly concerned about apps that collect users\u2019 personal data or have connections to Chinese military or intelligence activities.\n\nIn revoking some of President Donald Trump\u2019s blanket-style orders against Chinese tech companies and replacing them with a narrower approach, the Biden administration has not actually weighed in yet on whether TikTok and other apps pose a danger to Americans.\n\nBut a senior administration official said Wednesday that the Trump actions weren\u2019t \u201calways implemented in the soundest fashion\u201d and the aim of the review is to set up clear criteria to evaluate specific data security and privacy risks for each app. He said that could lead to a range of potential future actions on an app-by-app basis.\n\n\u201cWe want to take a tailored, tough approach here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe department will also make recommendations on how to further protect Americans\u2019 genetic and personal health information, and will address the risks of certain software apps connected to China or other adversaries, according to senior administration officials.\n\nTikTok on Wednesday declined to comment. WeChat did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s attempted bans didn\u2019t hold up legally as courts blocked them, and also \u201cran up against this critique that they were mimicking China\u2019s Great Firewall,\u201d said Samm Sacks, a fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cWhat the Biden administration wants to do is maintain an open, secure internet that doesn\u2019t take a page from Beijing\u2019s playbook, while addressing legitimate risk.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s move reflects ongoing concern that Americans\u2019 personal data could be exposed by popular apps tied to China, a chief U.S. economic and political rival. The White House and Congress have both taken action to address Beijing\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nThe Biden administration last week expanded a Trump-era list of Chinese companies that Americans can\u2019t invest in because of purported links to the Chinese military and surveillance. Companies on the list include China\u2019s state-owned telecommunications companies, telecom equipment maker Huawei and Chinese oil company China National Offshore Oil Corp.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill that aims to boost U.S. semiconductor production and the development of artificial intelligence and other technology in the face of growing international competition.\n\nThe new executive order should lead to a framework for protecting Americans\u2019 data from China, rather than targeting specific companies, and could pressure Congress to enact a data-security law in the years ahead, said Paul Triolo, a tech policy expert at the Eurasia Group consultancy.\n\nCourts had blocked the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to ban TikTok and WeChat, which began in summer 2020, but a national-security review of TikTok by a government group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, is ongoing. CFIUS had set deadlines for TikTok to divest its U.S. operations, but such a sale never happened.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in the Chinese-owned app on national security grounds. Neither Oracle or Walmart returned requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe Biden administration earlier this year had backed off President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to ban TikTok and WeChat as it reviewed national security threats posed by Chinese technology companies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has put on hold a case challenging Trump\u2019s TikTok divestment order.\n\nA cybersecurity and privacy analysis of TikTok published in March by the internet watchdog group Citizen Lab found no evidence of malicious behavior and said TikTok\u2019s data collection practices were no worse than other major social platforms such as Facebook.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that there is no overt data transmission to the Chinese government by TikTok,\u201d the report said. It added that TikTok\u2019s service did not contact any servers within China, but it was still theoretically possible that servers outside China could later transfer user data to China-based servers.",
