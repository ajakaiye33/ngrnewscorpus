Infrastructural challenges are the main issues facing the industry.\n\n\u201cWhile power supply challenge will likely take the first position, there are other issues like low capacity utilisation, poor patronage with little or no protection by government, infiltration of the pharmaceutical market by fake and substandard products, multiple taxations, high cost of funds, and unavailability of forex at Official rates among others.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Industry is not in such a position to overcome these challenges without the government playing a key role.\n\n\u201cAll over the world, the industries that have made it had huge support from their governments.\n\n\u201cSo the Nigerian government shouldn\u2019t shy away from playing its role both in the general provision of infrastructural facilities but also in providing industry-specific incentives.\n\n\u201cNAIP has, however, proposed the establishment of pharmaceutical manufacturing parks as a way of providing these needed infrastructure and industry-specific incentives in a strategic way.\n\n\u201cNAIP is working with government and industry players to make this happen quickly. \u201cThe association is working with the Ebonyi state government to establish a world-class pharmaceutical park.\n\n\u201cThe Ebonyi State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Park will be the first-of-its-kind in Nigeria and West Africa, Anukwu said.\n\nThe industrial pharmacist also bemoaned the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pharmaceutical sector, noting that the industry is still reeling from the viral pandemic\u2019s effect.\n\n\u201cHonestly it\u2019s difficult to quantify the losses which started since the first quarter of 2020 and is still on.\n\n\u201cThe supply chain hasn\u2019t been restored and for such an import-dependent industry the losses are enormous.\n\n\u201cDuring a Webinar we had in June 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 restrictions, some industry players put their contraction between 20 to 70 per cent,\u201d he said.\n\nAnukwu, however, noted that the pandemic has spurred the use of technology in many facets of its operation, adding that it (the pharmaceutical industry) could also benefit from efforts by the government to strengthen the healthcare system.\n\n\u201cThe most visible gain of the COVID-19 pandemic is maybe an adaptation of technology.\n\n\u201cAnother silver lining could be in the area of strengthening of our healthcare system as it has become evident that in a pandemic, every country thinks of its citizens first.\n\n\u201cSo, if we are wise in this country, this is the best time for the nation to start investing heavily in research and development to facilitate the production of home-grown pharmaceutical products and solutions to address our challenges as a country.\n\n\u201cThe Central Bank Nigeria made a move in this direction but much more is needed and for a stretch of time,\u201d Anukwu said.\n\nThe industrial pharmacist also dispelled the fear that the pharmaceutical sector in Nigeria is over-regulate.\n\n\u201cOver-regulation or under-regulation are relative terms and they are about perception.\n\n\u201cThough in some circles, perception is said to be everything.

He was, however, nabbed by security operatives in the neighboring country.\n\nAnother source said: \u201cSunday Igboho has been arrested in Cotonou. He was arrested about an hour ago.\n\n\u201cHe was supposed to travel to Germany through Cotonou this night. He wanted to leave Africa through Cotonou. He was arrested by security operatives in Cotonou.\n\n\u201cThey are planning to bring him back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt was further gathered that Igboho was arrested for an immigration offence bordering on owning the country\u2019s passport.\n\nVanguard was reliably informed that he may be arraigned in court today for the offence.\n\nMoves for his extradition\n\nBesides, it was gathered that the Federal Government is making moves to ensure Igboho is extradited to Nigeria.\n\nBut there are also strong moves by some Yoruba leaders to stop Igboho\u2019s extradition to Nigeria.\n\nSome Yoruba leaders, it was gathered, were engaged in marathon meetings last night to see how the Federal Government\u2019s extradition move can be thwarted.\n\nA source familiar with the development, who pleaded anonymity, told Vanguard: \u201cMeetings are ongoing by Yoruba leaders to rally round him (Igboho). There are plans to ensure that Igboho\u2019s extradition is stopped.\u201d\n\nHowever, efforts to get the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, last night to confirm this proved abortive as calls made to his telephone lines were unreplied.\n\nBeninoise govt shouldn\u2019t extra-dite him \u2014Igboho\u2019s lawyer\n\nWhen contacted, Sunday Igboho\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Yomi Alliyu, SAN, said yesterday he hadn\u2019t been in contact with his client since news of his arrest filtered in.\n\nHe expressed shock over the news that the Federal Government arrested Igboho with the help of INTERPOL in the Benin Republic.\n\nAlliyu, who spoke with Vanguard, said: \u201cI have not had contact with my client since the news of his arrest in Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nHe, however, urged the Beninoise government to refuse any application for extradition by the Federal Government.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cAgain, another wife of our client, Mrs Ropo Adeyemo, a German citizen, has been arrested together with her husband in Cotonou. What offence has she committed to warrant this?\n\n\u201cThe INTERPOL and Benin Republic should be aware of the act of savagery committed in his client\u2019s house in the wee hours of 1st July 2021, between 1.00 am and 3.00 am; shooting their way through and killing two people in the process and maliciously damaging his properties in the course of that illegal invasion.\n\n\u201cThe invading DSS officers did not state any reason for their invasion to our client before or during the invasion. They later paraded 13 people, arms and ammunition which our client denied to be his as he is a peaceful campaigner for self-determination and it is on good record that the guns and ammunitions displayed were the same displayed in 2013 in another instance.\n\n\u201cThis could be seen on 2013 Facebook though DSS has dismissed this on their website. But what they cannot deny is that when they were leaving our client\u2019s house they left with two corpses and people arrested and nothing more except two guns belonging to the police escorts of Mr. Adisa Saheed Olalekan.\n\n\u201cOne of the people they killed was one Mr. Olalekan of Oladams Motors, Osogbo, who came to Sunday Igboho\u2019s house to discuss auto business. He came with two police escorts. Though the policemen were not among the people paraded to the public, heir guns were among those displayed.\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 among Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution the host country should not release the fugitive.\n\n\u201cArticle 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries. This made Chief Sunday Adeyemo a political offender who cannot be deported and/or extradited by the good people of the Republic of Benin for any reason.\n\n\u201cSecondly, that he cannot get justice or even be killed is apparent in how those arrested in his house were detained for more than 21days now without access to their lawyers. Even the wife among them could not change her undies for 21 days. Which inhuman treatment can be more this?\n\n\u201cWe urge the good government of the Republic of Benin and the international community, especially Germany, to rise and curb the impunity of the Nigerian Government by refusing any application for extradition of our client, who already has an application before the ICC duly acknowledged.\u201d\n\nAyo Adebanjo, Afenifere, Akintoye, YCE, others react\n\nThe news of Igboho\u2019s arrest, however, generated mixed reactions from Yoruba leaders and groups, including the leader of the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo; the Yoruba Council of Elders, YCE, leader of Ilana Omo Oodua, Professor Banji Akintoye; Afenifere Renewal Group, ARG, former governor of Oyo State, Chief Rashidi Ladoja and Kiriji Heritage Defenders.\n\nWe\u2019ve mobilized lawyers to fight Igboho\u2019s extradition \u2014 Akintoye\n\nIn his reaction, renowned historian and leader of the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, who confirmed Igboho\u2019s arrest said that he, alongside other Yoruba patriots are currently working to assist Ighoho prevent his extradition back to Nigeria, saying \u201cBenin Republic is a land that respects the rules of law.\u201d\n\nAkintoye in a statement by his Communications Manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, called on all Yoruba people within and beyond the shores of Nigeria to ensure their ancestral land was not defeated by invaders.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cI received last night the troubling information that Chief Sunday Adeyemo fondly called Igboho had been arrested at the Cotonou Airport.\n\n\u201cI and other Yoruba Patriots who are immediately available are now working to assist, and ensure that nobody will be able to do to him anything unlawful or primitive and to prevent him from being extradited into Nigeria which is strongly possible.\n\n\u201cFortunately, Benin Republic is reliably a land of law where the authorities responsibly obey the law. We have secured the services of a leading and highly-respected lawyer whom we can confidently rely on.\n\n\u201cWhat the situation now calls for is that the Yoruba nation at home and in Diaspora must stand strong, resolved that neither Sunday Igboho nor any other Yoruba person will henceforth be subjected to dehumanizing treatment of any kind.\n\n\u201cWe, Yoruba nation, are, by the grace of God, a very strong nation. We must arise now to show that strength.\n\n\u201cFor a start, we must all see to it now that Sunday Ighoho will get his freedom back to be able to move and operate as a free person. We all know he has committed no crime.\u2019\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re still studying situation\u2014Afenifere\n\nOn its part, Afenifere said though surprised over the Igboho\u2019s arrest, it was still studying the situation of events before making a formal statement.\n\nWhen contacted, Afenifere\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cThe news of the arrest was a surprise. But the body is still studying the situation before making a formal statement as details of the arrest is still sketchy.\u201d\n\nHe was, however, quick to add that \u201csecurity agencies appear to be more active in hunting those who are peacefully agitating for the rights and better deals for their people than they appear to be in dealing with bandits and terrorists who have deprived thousands of innocent Nigerians of their lives and properties.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIf half of the energy deployed to apprehend Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho had been deployed to the menace of terrorists and bandits who kill, rape, rob and kidnap people, we would not have been in the unfortunate security mess that we are.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that government will direct more attention to addressing issues that gave birth to ethnic agitations. The earlier this is done the better.\u201d\n\nWar has been declared on Yoruba people with Igboho\u2019s arrest \u2014Adebanjo\n\nBut Afenifere leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo said war has been declared on Yoruba people following the arrest of Yoruba freedom fighter.\n\nAdebanjo said: \u201cYoruba worldwide should take to the streets to make sure that Sunday Igboho is not brought back to Nigeria and if they bring him back, the Yoruba should ensure that he is not badly tortured or worse. They have declared war on our people.\n\n\u201cFreedom is never given, it is always won. People are too afraid of this regime and we have said it over and over that they should be bold to confront them and take back their country.\n\n\u201cThey are ruling us with a Constitution that we did not make. It is a military Constitution and they have been rejecting all efforts to adopt a new Constitution, including the 2014 national conference.\u201d\n\nHe should be given right to defend self \u2014YCE\n\nAlso reacting, the Yoruba Council of Elders, YCE, said Igboho should be granted the right to defend himself, if truly he had been arrested.\n\nThe Secretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, said: \u201cFor me, it has not been confirmed officially, and I am sure that the Department of State Security, DSS, will ultimately confirm if it\u2019s true. And if it\u2019s true, they have to go through the due process of law to carry out an investigation.\n\n\u201cHe should be charged to a constituted court of law and should be granted the right to defend himself. There should be no course for alarm until we hear officially if he has been arrested.\n\n\u201cBut I want to tell you, his arrest cannot in any way, affect the Yoruba nation agitation. If the agitations are genuine with their convictions, that should not derail them from achieving their aims.\u201d\n\nGrant Igboho, Kanu amnesty as Boko Haram insurgents, Ladoja tells FG\n\nSimilarly, a former governor of Oyo State, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, urged the Federal Government to grant amnesty to Igboho and the detained leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, just like it did to several Boko Haram insurgents that were also enlisted into some security agencies.\n\nLadoja, who spoke with journalists at his Ondo Street, Bodija, Ibadan residence, said arresting Igboho and Kanu could not end the agitation for self-determination across the country, adding that their agitations were a result of the government\u2019s failure to tackle insecurity in the country, which has escalated.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to appeal to the Federal Government to grant Igboho and Kanu amnesty, just as some of the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents, were given amnesty. Igboho and Kanu are the creation of the Federal Government. Why? Because whenever they arrested herdsmen, who were killing their people, the Federal Government never acts. That was why those two people came up to defend their people.\n\n\u201cThe Boko Haram members that were arrested a year ago by the Federal Government have been released to the Borno State Government. The Federal Government created Sunday Igboho in the context of Igangan massacre. People are agitating for what they believe in. They should be treated with care, and not as criminals.\n\n\u201cYoruba leaders, including the Alaafin of Oyo, have been complaining about atrocities committed by Fulani herdsmen without a response from the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cOrder would come from above to release them and that is why people resorted to self-help. It is in this process that Igboho was created due to the killings that had been happening in Ibarapa axis and nobody has been arrested and even if they were arrested, they will be released.\n\n\u201cArrest of Igboho will not change anything if Federal Government failed to do the needful, many Igboho will be created. Just like Kanu has become an acclaimed leader, and to some people, Igboho has also become a leader. If caution is not taken by the Federal Government, the issue might boomerang, leading to many Igboho and Kanu.\u201d\n\nViolent abuse of rights awaits Igboho, if extradited \u2014 ARG\n\nAlso reacting, the Afenifere Renewal Group, ARG, expressed worry that Igboho\u2019s right might be violently abused if he is extradited.\n\nARG\u2019s chairman and secretary, Messrs Olawale Oshun and Ayo Afolabi respectively, said: \u201cWe have just learned that Sunday Adeyemo, one of the leading activists against the unmitigated terror of herdsmen, has been intercepted in Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cIt is mind-boggling however that Nigerian central government\u2019s concerted effort to ground the peaceful pursuit of self-determination by Mr. Adeyemo is not commensurate with its grovelling attitude towards murderous herdsmen, whose plan to overrun Yorubaland and turn it into a terrorized space is not hidden \u2013 but for the solid determination of Yoruba governors. Similarly, we have not seen such concerted effort directed at checkmating bandits who have turned the country into a war zone.\u2019\u2019\n\nFG pursuing shadow, not substance \u2014 Ozekhome\n\nIn his reaction, constitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), yesterday, berated the Federal Government for engaging in what he termed as arresting and repatriation of \u201cdissenters and challengers of its morbid nepotic and sectionalisitic policies.\n\nOzekhome, in a statement, challenged the Federal Government to exert the same energy it applied in the case of Igboho and IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, to tackle \u201cAK-47 wielding armed bandits, Boko Haram and other deadly insurgents\u201d he said have continued to hold the nation to ransom.\u201d\n\nMaintaining that he was not impressed with the arrest of Kanu and Igboho, Ozekhome, said: \u201cThe FG appears supersonically efficacious when it comes to arresting and repatriating dissenters and challenges of its morbid nepotic and sectionalisitic government.\n\n\u201cThe same government paradoxically appears abysmally weak and hopelessly helpless when it comes to fighting AK-47 wielding armed bandits, Boko Haram and other deadly insurgents, including ransom-taking kidnappers who are almost kidnapping the very heart and soul of Nigeria daily. The Nigerian nation appears captured by non-state actors.\n\n\u201cTo me, this lopsided template demonstrates acute intolerance and ambivalence. It shows self-contradiction.\u201d\n\nIgboho shouldn\u2019t be treated like a criminal \u2014 Kiriji Heritage Defenders\n\nAlso, a socio-cultural group, Kiriji Heritage Defenders warned that treating Igboho as a criminal would only embolden more agitators against the Federal Government.\n\nIn a statement by its Director-General, Dr Ekundayo Ademola, yesterday in Osogbo, disclosed that treating Igboho as a criminal would only embolden more agitators against the federal government.\n\nConfusion trails Sunday Igboho\u2019s purported release\n\nConfusion has begun to trail the release of Sunday Igboho as Vanguard reliably gathered that Igboho is yet to be released.\n\nOne of Igboho\u2019s aides, Mr. Dapo Salami, who spoke to Vanguard, said the report that he (Igboho) has been released was false and misleading.\n\nSalami said: \u201cHe is still being detained. Disregard any information that says Chief Igboho has been released. But I believe notable Yoruba leaders should have been working on ways to secure his release without any delay.\u201d\n\nFollowing his arrest, Igboho\u2019s supporters and organisers like one Emmanuel Adebayo, are scampering for safety and seeking asylum for the fear of security operatives being on their trail.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "But there are also strong moves by some Yoruba leaders to stop Igboho\u2019s extradition to Nigeria.\nThere are plans to ensure that Igboho\u2019s extradition is stopped.\u201dHowever, efforts to get the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, last night to confirm this proved abortive as calls made to his telephone lines were unreplied.\nHe expressed shock over the news that the Federal Government arrested Igboho with the help of INTERPOL in the Benin Republic.\nWe all know he has committed no crime.\u2019\u2019We\u2019re still studying situation\u2014AfenifereOn its part, Afenifere said though surprised over the Igboho\u2019s arrest, it was still studying the situation of events before making a formal statement.\nThe earlier this is done the better.\u201dWar has been declared on Yoruba people with Igboho\u2019s arrest \u2014AdebanjoBut Afenifere leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo said war has been declared on Yoruba people following the arrest of Yoruba freedom fighter.",

          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), has formally applied for speedy trial of the treasonable felony charges brought against him by the Nigerian government.\n\nKanu has sought for a fiat to that effect from the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja, Justice John Tsoho, for permission for his trial to be held during the court\u2019s annual vacation.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that Kanu\u2019s action may not be unconnected with his wish to be moved out of the detention facility of the Department of the State Service DSS after an order by trial judge, Justice Binta Nyako.\n\nAlthough the trial has been slated for October 21 by the trial judge due to yearly vacation of the court, Kanu opted for an early date that will enable his lawyer to argue his already filed motion on notice seeking his transfer from the DSS custody to prison for continuation of his remand.\n\nNnamdi Kanu may remain in detention as judges begin vacation\n\nHowever at the time of this report, DAILY POST could not ascertain if the Chief Judge would be disposed to granting of the fiat request from Kanu since such request, by law, ought to be initiated by the Federal Government that filed the criminal charges.\n\nKanu\u2019s lead counsel, Mr Ifeanyi Ejiofor, confirmed filing the application for fiat to the office of the Chief Judge adding that it is in the interest of justice for the application to be granted.\n\nIt has been widely anticipated that the Federal Government might apply for a fiat from the Chief Judge to fast track Kanu\u2019s trial during the court vacation in view of the sensitivity and nature of the criminal charges.\n\nFindings by DAILY POST at the Federal Ministry of Justice in Abuja on Friday however revealed that the government was not contemplating any decision to rush the trial.\n\nRather, the government has opted that the trial be in line with the October 21 date fixed for resumption of the case by Justice Nyako at the last adjourned date.\n\nDependable government officials told our correspondent that there was nothing urgent in the charges to warrant the federal government seeking the prosecution of the defendant during court vacation.\n\nDAILY POST was also told that the justice ministry has opted to be meticulous and follow sequence order in the trial rather than disrupting the vacation calendar of the court.\n\nThe Ministry sources hinted that the adjournment of the trial to October 21 will rather be used to gather more evidence especially from outside the country on the alleged unlawful activities of Kanu when he jumped the bail granted him and escaped out of the country.\n\nIt was learnt that two major countries would be visited in the next few days by officials of the Federal Ministry of Justice to obtain information and gather more exhibits that will aid the government in establishing its case appropriately in court against the defendant.\n\n\u201cAs far as the government is concerned, there is nothing to warrant seeking hury or speedy trial. All we are concerned with is diligent prosecution of the charges.\n\n\u201cThe media should not forget that the defendant ran out of the country for over two years during which some other things, either lawfully or unlawfully were done. Security operatives are already looking at those things and their report will inform our line of action when trial resumes,\u201d a source said.\n\nFederal High Court begins annual vacation July 26\n\nThe source declined information on whether the charges against Kanu may likely be amended, adding that fresh evidence being gathered and findings of the security operatives on Kanu\u2019s activities while outside the shore of Nigeria in the past two years will give a line of direction.\n\nThe Federal Government counsel, Mr Mrohammed Abubakar, of the Federal Ministry of Justice could not be reached for comments on the issue.\n\nKanu\u2019s resumption of trial had on Monday July 26 been stalled on two grounds of failure to produce him in court for physical appearance as required by law and the yearly vacation of the court which commenced on that day.\n\nHis lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, had made concerted efforts to move the court to hear some motions but the trial Judge, Justice Binta Nyako drew the lawyer\u2019s attention to legality of doing so in the physical absence of Kanu as the defendant and the court vacation.\n\nThe judge had said that only the Federal Government, being the complainant in the matter, can move the court to sit during vacation by applying for a fiat from the Chief Judge to that effect adding also that the law forbids her court from applying for fiat on behalf of any party in the matter.\n\nJustice Nyako subsequently fixed October 21 as return date with an order that Kanu remain in the custody of the Department of the State Service, DSS.\n\nThe judge however ordered the DSS to allow counsel and family members access Kanu twice a week and during working days only.",

However, we are yet to receive our forms or get modalities on when the forms will be given to us and how the congress will be conducted on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Governor has hijacked the forms and other materials meant for the congress for his political group, IleriOluwa,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari and other national leaders of the APC to intervene and call Governor Oyetola and Prince Famodun to order.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, members of another group within the APC in Osun, The Osun Progressives (TOP), were seen with several copies of the delegate forms for Saturday\u2019s ward congresses in the state.\n\nIn his reaction, the Director of Media and Publicity of the party in the state, Barrister Kunle Oyatomi, in a telephone conversation with this medium, stated that the accusations were baseless as the party chairman nor the state was shielding any party official from the APC national secretariat.\n\nHe explained that since nobody was shielding anybody, what happened was that on arrival in Osun, they were given befitting and comfortable accommodations for them to get settled adding that party officials in the state and members were free to go and see them as they wished but that they will not be coming to the state secretariat.\n\nOyatomi also disclosed to DAILY POST that the ward congress in the state would still go on for Saturday 31st July, 2021 as planned because the party in the state is one family and there was no point in unnecessary infighting.\n\nHe advised party members to shun unnecessary divisions since the governor has done much for the party and the state in general.\n\nThe APC spokesperson in the state also assured that Oyetola will come out victorious in the gubernatorial election in 2022 based on his antecedents since inception of his administration in November, 2018.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the Secretary of the party in the state, Alhaji Rasaq Salinsile, had revealed that the congress may not hold on Saturday 31st July, 2021 because there was no consensus amongst members.",

The activities of HYPPADEC will be most beneficial to communities that have suffered as a result of the location of these hydro dams over the years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe governing council also visited Benue and inspected areas in Makurdi devastated by ecological challenges as a result of an overflow of water from dams. Benue state, unlike Niger and Kwara has no dam but experiences yearly devastation from overflow of dams.\u201d\n\nHe said the commission has flagged off the cutting of tree logs in Kainji and Shiroro lakes in Kebbi and Niger states to prevent boat accidents.\n\nManaging Director of the commission, Abubakar Yelwa said HYPPADEC will soon start providing succour to communities in the affected states following the approval of its budget by the National Assembly.\n\nHe added that the commission would start delivering meaningful projects once it finishes its needs assessment.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe had familiarisation tour to the states to give us an insight into the reconnaissance position of the communities. We are now working on a baseline survey to actuate the various difficulties faced by the various communities because not all communities face one problem.\n\n\u201cIn some communities, it is flooding in others it is not.

          "text": "How is that even possible?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t touch the money and rolling over the monthly return since November 2020, that is exactly what the figure would have been by end of April 2021.\n\nTeejay is the team captain of a telegram channel called FOOTBALL TRADERS CLUB. He gave account of how he did it and one would have thought it\u2019s a big deal but it is simple and easy.\n\nHe reinstates that he isn\u2019t a tipster but a smart business guy who has mastered the act of making truck loads of cash from football betting/trading with his team members.\n\nFirst step; He uncovered 2 reliable and trustworthy tipsters from Europe after testing several futile ones. He made use of the tips supplied from them daily. One supplies average of 1.7 odds daily and the other supplies average of 3 odds daily. Adetunji combines both to achieve 5+ odds daily. Last 10 months have all yielded profit\n\nThe journey to uncovering the trusted tipsters took him 4years of falling into the hands of scammers. He still does trying to get back-ups for his performing and trusted tipsters. So many stories but I have to cut short to save us time.\n\nSecondly step; Adetunji sees football betting from a different perspective unlike many others sees it. The reason he called his approach FOOTBALL TRADING and not football betting. He follows a laid down plan. Only 2% of people around the globe into football betting know about this secret approach.\n\nRandomly Selected Proof from few Members At the end of April\n\nThe highest earner up there traded with N4m in April to generate N14.7m\n\nN100,000 starting capital\n\nIt will wow you to know that 100k turned to 50million naira in 6 months. (he confessed he never rolled over for all 6 months). This was a journey from Nov. 2020 to April 2021. The strategy is to stake 5% of capital daily and as winnings comes and capital increases, recalculate capital and new 5% daily stake. You can see the drift in the tables of results as achieved in the last 6 months in discuss.\n\nI have subscribers who use =N=500k, =N=1M etc even up to =N=5M trading my football signal monthly and profiting awesomely for their braveness.\n\nTeejay is so proud and sure of his business and strategies that you will see his face like this on his telegram channel unlike most ghost online biz people you\u2019ve come across.\n\nThese 6 months as displayed below is verifiable. On the telegram channel, every win from November 2020 to date were captured in the posts there if scrolled to back to see.\n\nApril ended in 406%. That\u2019s a 306% profit for the month of March. Obviously a decent month. Best so far in 2021.\n\nMarch ended in 150%. That\u2019s a 50% profit for the month of March. Obviously the lowest so far in the last 5 months.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n28th ended in a loss and revenue dropped to N263,000. That is a 263% return for February. A 163% pure profit!\n\nJanuary 2021 ended at N235,000. That is a 235% return. A 135% pure profit.\n\nDecember ended at N241,000. That is a 241%\n\nNovember ended on N562,000. That is 562%\n\nVERY IMPOTANT!!!\n\nThis is not an investment program like some people have the misconception and thought they have to pay me money to give them profit. NO!\n\nRead through this content very well.\n\nThis is football trading and the service rendered by TEEJAY is sharing his daily tips and strategy to use like he does. It\u2019s this service that cost the fee he charges on his telegram channel.\n\nYou on your own will run it\u2026 open a sport betting account (sportybet, betking, merrybet etc), fund it with your trading capital. (profit is directly proportional to this since returns is measured by percentage monthly), use 1minute of your time daily (11am) to copy and paste the code given, load it and stake.\n\nMonth Returns May 2021 170% April 2021 406% March 2021 150% February 2021 263% January 2021 235% December 2020 241% November 2020 562%\n\nThat\u2019s the break down above. And the calculation is simple. Nov 2020 turned 100k to N562,000. If all amount was used in December and with 241% return, it will turn to N1,354,000.\n\nJanuary 2021, if N1,354,000 was used as the capital and a 235% return for that month, it means return would be N3,182,000. If all were used in February and at a 263% return, it would turn to N8,370,000.\n\nIf all were used in March and with 50% profit, it would have turned to N12.55million!\n\n406% in April. If all N12.55M were used, that would be N50M+\n\nImagine it\u2019s N200,000 started with, that would have been Over N100million.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t want to compound for long, you can get to a point of N1,000,000 return monthly within 3 months.\n\nOff-SEASON\u2019s RED FLAG\n\nMonth Revenue July 2021 135% (as at July 26th) June 2021 36% (64% of capital lost)\n\n100% transparency is the watch-word of the Captain of this system. Therefore, you need to be informed that whenever it is off-season (June/July), it\u2019s important you go on Vacation from part of your all season-long profit and take a break. As you can see, June never gave profit but swallowed a whooping 64% of Capital. July gave some profit though. Only Lion-hearted can roll in this period as the result are often poor coz of unavailability of enough league matches to analyse by the tipsters.\n\nN 50 Million in 6 months is the figure\n\nClick Here=> http://bit.ly/lndkjad, to subscribe to Adetunji\u2019s telegram channel and you will see the process to join his team. He doesn\u2019t gamble but follow a laid down rule. He use 5% of his capital to stake each game and does capital recalculation along the line. He trusted his tipsters from Europe and strictly use their games.\n\nHe confessed that there are times that the tipster does have bad days. He recalled a certain bad month where there were 10 back to back loss but having come a long way to trust them, he always keeps calm, think of long-term benefits and hope for the best. And overall, it\u2019s been fantastic.\n\nThis whole thing might look complex especially to those who are not used to football betting already. But it isn\u2019t. Even someone who hasn\u2019t done anything related to football betting before can implement this. Even if you don\u2019t know who C. Ronaldo or Mourinho is.\n\nI have told ADETUNJI to give more detailed explanation of the steps and processes involved, including sharing the games of his trusted Tipsters. If you want that, Great! It means you can replicate his success.\n\nWawwuuuu\n\nBelow is this Guy in the little world of his own. He vowed to me that his target is for Naija bookies to recognise his threat to them and come looking for him to pay him off with hundreds of Millions of Naira to stop teaching Nigerians how to beat them. You will do yourself a whole lot of Goods to get on board his telegram channel before that happens.\n\nI have convinced him to show this secret to just 97 people on how he did it.

          "title": "How To Detect Scam Gift Cards Platforms in Nigeria",
          "text": "Anyone can create a standard website or native application. Hence, you shouldn\u2019t expect scam websites to look shabby. Beautifully designed and well-structured websites may be the front for a scam. The aesthetics don\u2019t matter when it comes to scam. A gift scam exchange will get your gift card details and not remit payment. You\u2019ll contact support, but there will be no one to answer you.\n\nThere is little to what you can do when you fall victim to gift card scams. There is no government protection for gift card traders in Nigeria. It\u2019s also going to be difficult to get the platform\u2019s operators arrested because the address and other contact details you\u2019ll see are bogus.\n\nHence, when you want to trade your gift cards for cash, how can you avoid falling victim to scams? We explore preventive solutions in this article.\n\nHOW TO IDENTIFY AND AVOID SCAM GIFT CARD PLATFORM\n\nScammers won\u2019t necessarily create a dedicated website for their escapades. Some may leverage already existing peer to peer platforms. You must be able to identify these too. Here is a list of what you can do to avoid scammers in the Nigerian gift cards trading space.\n\nDon\u2019t Be Greedy\n\nGreed can lead you to accept offers that you\u2019ll normally see to be scams. Some scammers promise non-feasible rates to lure unsuspecting and greedy people. Hence, you should be aware of industry-standard rates, so you can know when someone is stringing you along in their scheme. When their rates are becoming too good to be true, it\u2019s time to take some steps backwards.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou can\u2019t become wealthy from trading gift cards for a few years. Trading gift cards will at most afford you just some extra cash per time. Hence, know what to expect and be content. Being greedy is the beginning of you running at a loss in whatever digital endeavour you get involved in.\n\nConfirm the Contact Details Are Functional\n\nWhen you find a new website you are interested in, ensure that you check their contact details. Though contacting the stated support or customer care details isn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s a start. When conversing with support, you should ask questions. If, however, you are in a hurry and want instant cash from your gift card, go to platforms like Gift Cards Hub.\n\nWhile querying the contact or support behind the website, you can identify if it\u2019s a scam. Scammers won\u2019t give you straight answers. Even if a new platform sounds so convincing, don\u2019t make hasty decisions. Do further research, except you are comfortable with losing money.\n\nCheck for Business Registration\n\nGift Card exchanges are businesses. Hence, you should, at least, check for the platform\u2019s registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Again, registration with CAC doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility of the operators being scammers. However, with registration, there is a glimmer of hope at locating the operators if something goes wrong.\n\nResearch In-depth\n\nScam platforms won\u2019t have much information you can track on the internet. Hence, conduct your research from trusted platforms. Please get to know the creators behind the platform, check through their social and digital footprints. You\u2019ll know shady people when you see them.\n\nIn-depth research may take time. However, in the end, it\u2019s worth it. Read through comments, search for the gift card trading platform on Twitter, and check their mentions. No amount of due diligence is too much when money is involved.\n\nDon\u2019t Feel Obligated To Use the Platform.\n\nEven if you know the creator of the platform, don\u2019t feel obligated to use any platform. Be logical in your decision to choose the best gift card trading app in Nigeria. Sentiments can land you in trouble. Even if an acquaintance introduces you to a platform, still do your due diligence. When conduct in-depth research, you may find something your referrer missed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt\u2019s possible to do your due diligence and still be scammed. Scammers are evolving per time and trying to beat people\u2019s common sense. Hence, it would be best to go for reputable platforms. On Gift Card Hub, you can securely trade whatever gift card you are interested in, at the best rate, without risk of scam. Start trading safely.",

          "text": "By Emma Njoku, Ndubuisi Orji, Molly Kilete and Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nA United States District Court has ordered the arrest of the Head, Nigerian Inspector General of Police\u2019sIntelligence Response Team (IGP-IRT) and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abba Kyari, for his alleged role in a multi-million dollar fraud perpetrated by Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, and his co-conspirators.\n\nA court document obtained by the media revealed that Otis Wright of the United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to track down Kyari and produce him in the U.S, for his role in large scale international fraud.\n\nHushpuppi, who was arrested in Dubai in June last year, has pleaded guilty to the fraud charges in the U.S. The FBI said Hushpuppi and Kyari, both of whom it alleged had been friends, conspired to launder money.\n\nThe FBI also indicted Kyari for allegedly receiving bribes from Hushpuppi to arrest a member of the syndicate in Nigeria. If found guilty of the allegation, Kyari may be jailed for 20 years.\n\n\u201cA criminal complaint and an indictment contain allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\u201cBoth conspiracy counts alleged in the indictment carry a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory two-year prison term,\u201d the court document revealed. Judge Wright\u2019s order for the FBI to arrest Mr Kyari and hold him in U.S. custody was unsealed on July 26.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari, has denied allegations of conspiracy with Hushpuppi, claiming that he only met him two years ago and never demanded nor collect any bribe from him.\n\nKyari, who made the clarification on his Facebook page, said those celebrating the allegations by the internet fraudster against him would be disappointed and put to shame.\n\nHe said: \u201cFriends: Abbas, who we later came to know as Hushpuppi, called our office about two years ago that somebody seriously threatened to kill his family here in Nigeria, and he sent the person\u2019s phone number and pleaded we take action before the person attacks his family. We traced and arrested the suspect and after investigations, we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life, and they were long time friends who had money issues, hence, we released the suspect on bail.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and said he liked them. He was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300,000 directly to the person\u2019s account. The native clothes and caps (five sets) were brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\u201d\n\n\u2022IGP orders his probe\n\nInspector General of Police(IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, has ordered an investigation into the alleged indictment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), against Abba Kyari.\n\nForce public relations officer, Frank Mba, who made this known in Abuja, also confirmed the receipt of the said allegations by the FB, by the police force headquarters.\n\nMba assured the commitment of the Nigerian Police to conduct a through investigation so as not to jeopardise its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners. The Force PRO in a statement yesterday in Abuja said: \u201cSequel to the receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against one of the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, Abba Kyari, the Inspector General of Police,Usman Alkali Baba has ordered an internal review of the allegations. The Nigeria Police Force reaffirms its commitment to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners. Further developments on this case will be communicated to members of the public accordingly.\u201d\n\n\u2022Go clear your name in US- HURIWA\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, (HURIWA) has advised the Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, to file and defend a counter affidavit of accusation of bribery made against him by a fraud suspect, Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi in the United States.\n\nA US court had said that Hushpuppi allegedly used Kyari to arrest and jail a co-conspirator, Chibuzo Vincent, after the latter threatened to expose a $1million fraud committed against a Qatari businessman.\n\nAlthough Kyari had denied allegations of conspiracy with Hushpuppi, URIWA\u2019s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, in a statement, yesterday, said Kyari should not be scared of injustice because of the transparent nature of the judicial system in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America is an organised Constitutional democracy, where the rule of law is supreme. So, if a crime suspect makes an affidavit accusation under oath against you, it doesn\u2019t need to be disclaimed in the local media here.\n\n\u201cThe best thing to do even before the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses the services of the INTERPOL to hunt you down, as someone who is sure that his conscience is clear, is to take the next available flight to Washington DC or New York, to connect to the court room, then use a legal representation to file and defend yourself through an affidavit evidence to counter what you think is a tissue of falsehood.\n\n\u201cTelling us this cock-and-bull story of how you, a very senior police officer, acted as the agent of a local tailor, is irrelevant and of no moment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022PDP demands full investigation\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded a forensic investigation into reports by the United States (US) FBI linking head of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari, to Abbas Ramon, popularly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, described the news about Kyari\u2019s alleged involvement in receipt of proceeds of international fraud as worrisome and a stain on the integrity of Nigeria.\n\nThe opposition party charged President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the IGP, Usman Baba, to question Kyari, and if found culpable, he should be handed over to the FBI.\n\n\u201cIt is, indeed, disquieting that the integrity of our nation has fallen so abysmally low under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration, to the extent that the head of its police intelligence unit is being charged in connection with international fraud.\n\n\u201cOur party demands that the APC administration should not sweep this matter under the carpet given the manifest rapport between Kyari and some top APC leaders.\n\n\u201cWe urge President Buhari not to \u201cease out\u201d this case of corruption but, immediately, restore the integrity and image of our nation, by allowing a forensic investigation on the suspect.\n\n\u201cMoreover, if this Abba Kyari matter is not well handled, it will be a permanent stain on the reputation of our police, security system and our nation at large,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have met with the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba to demand the arrest and extradition of Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari to the United States, SaharaReporters learnt.\n\nAccording to a top source, four FBI agents met with the IGP on Thursday asking that Nigeria's celebrated cop, Kyari be taken to the United States for interrogation over his role in the activities of suspected serial internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas, more commonly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nThe source stated that the agents have returned on Friday (today) to ensure their demands are met, citing the urgency of the case.\n\n\n\nHe said, \"FBI agents met with the IGP yesterday (Thursday) to demand Abba Kyari's arrest and extradition to the United States citing the urgency of the case. Four FBI agents returned to the IG\u2019s office this morning, they are there asking the IGP to release Kyari for interrogation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as of Thursday night, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, had ordered an internal review of the receipt of allegations and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation against Kyari.\n\n\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by the force's spokesperson, Frank Mba, on its Facebook page on Thursday night.\n\n\n\nThe force also stated that it is committed to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners.\n\n\n\nIt assured Nigerians to further communicate developments on the case to members of the public.\n\n\n\nThe statement read, \"Sequel to the receipt of allegations and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against one of the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, DCP Abba Kyari, the Inspector General of Police IGP Usman Alkali Baba psc (+), NPM, fdc has ordered an internal review of the allegations.\n\n\n\n\"The Nigeria Police Force reaffirms its commitment to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners.\n\n\n\n\"Further developments on this case will be communicated to members of the public accordingly.\"\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported that the United States' Court had issued a warrant of arrest for Kyari, over his role in Hushpuppi\u2019s multi-million naira fraud probe.\n\n\n\nOtis Wright of the United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to track down Kyari and produce him in the United States for his role in a multi-million dollar fraud.\n\n\n\nAbbas was arrested in Dubai last June and he pleaded guilty to fraud in the U.S. this week.\n\n\n\nThe FBI said Abbas and Kyari have been friends and were both involved in a conspiracy to launder money.\n\n\n\nAmerican prosecutors first sought a court warrant to arrest Kyari on February 12, 2021.\n\n\n\nAnother warrant was requested on April 29, 2021.\n\n\n\nJudge Wright\u2019s permission for the FBI to arrest Mr Kyari and hold him in U.S. custody was unsealed on July 26.\n\n\n\nHushpuppi had narrated how he bribed Kyari to have one of his rivals arrested and jailed in Nigeria following a dispute over a $1.1 million dupe of a Qatari businessperson.\n\n\n\nAbbas had asked Kyari to arrest and jail a fellow fraudster Kelly Chibuzor Vincent after both were locked in a dispute presumably over how to share the $1.1 million loot received from the Qatari businessperson.\n\n\n\nAbbas had pleaded guilty to a multi-million fraud earlier this month and faces up to 20 years in jail.\n\n\n\nHe will be sentenced in the coming weeks and will forfeit some of his assets and his rights to appeal while also paying restitution to victims of his years-long fraud.\n\n\n\nKyari in a statement on Facebook has, however, dismissed the allegations of bribe.",

We are diagnosing between 100 and 300 new cases every day,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur isolation facilities are full and filling up every day. We are creating more space as we speak, I will just like to appeal to everybody that COVID-19 is not over. We don\u2019t know how many more waves we are going to experience and so it is important that we stick to the non- pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n\u201cAs I came in here, I saw people shaking hands and hugging; I think the elbow greeting is appropriate for this time.

          "title": "In 2003, south-east voted for Obasanjo against Ojukwu -- why?",
          "text": "Those plunking for secession and advancing hate for the north may not know that the region was once a convenient political ally of the south-east. The political establishment of the 1960\u2019s was governed by the north and the south-east in expedient nuptials \u2014 before the January 1966 coup which opened Pandora\u2019s Box. The north and the south-east have had a crossed destiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe politics of the Igbo has not always been suffused with emotions and native prejudices. A good case is the pragmatic entente Nnamdi Azikiwe\u2019s NCNC forged with Ahmadu Bello\u2019s NPC in the 60s \u2013 despite the two parties\u2019 diagonal differences. While Bello\u2019s NPC was ultra-conservative, Azikiwe\u2019s NCNC had a liberal character.\n\nAlso, in 1979 the south-east worked with the north to see the emergence of Alex Ekwueme as Nigeria\u2019s first vice-president under a presidential system of government \u2014 and with Shehu Shagari as president \u2014 less than 10 years after the Nigeria-Biafra civil war. In fact, while Ekwueme was a member of the National Peoples Party (NPP), Shagari was a member of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). But this did not stop the entente cordiale.\n\nAlthough the NPP/NPN alliance later became fractious in 1981, the emergence of an Igbo citizen as vice-president a few years after the war blurred the blot of the Igbo being a conquered people. It was under this arrangement that Odumegwu Ojukwu was allowed to return to Nigeria from exile in Ivory Coast in June 1982. And a year after his return (in 1983) he ran for senatorial office \u2013 but lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe south-east was heuristic in these instances, and played realpolitik. But what happened afterwards?\n\nIn the 2003 presidential election in which Ojukwu, the famed Igbo leader, vied, the south-east voted tremendously for his rival \u2013 Olusegun Obasanjo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In fact, Ojukwu\u2019s \u2018\u2019Igbo party\u2019\u2019, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) could not even win governorship elections in the south-east except in Anambra \u2014 the late politician\u2019s native home.\n\nIn Anambra, Obasanjo had 466,866 votes which represent 54 percent of the entire count while Ojukwu had 279,378 \u2013 34 percent of the total tally. In Abia, Obasanjo had 386,748 votes (51.7 percent) while Ojukwu had 260,899 votes (34.9 percent). In Ebonyi, Obasanjo had 752,823 votes (94.5 percent) but Ojukwu polled only 20,525 votes (02.6 percent) within the same range as Muhammadu Buhari who had 16,308 votes in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Enugu, Obasanjo had 897,721 votes (79.7 percent) while Ojukwu had 177,050 votes (15.7 percent). And in Imo, Obasanjo polled 656,861 votes (64.6 percent), but Ojukwu had 281,114 votes (27.7 percent). The late Igbo leader\u2019s second attempt in 2007 was also unsuccessful.\n\nObasanjo trounced Ojukwu on his own turf. Why? The election was not so much about Ojukwu, but about the centring of the south-east. The Igbo elite consorted with the PDP which at the time had a national appeal, and they were able to pivot the south-east in the nucleus of national politics.\n\nBut the south-east\u2019s liaison with the PDP over the years has not yielded commensurate dividends in terms of economic and infrastructural developments for the region. The beneficiaries of the PDP years were the elite who had sizeable representations in government.\n\nWith the deracination of the PDP from central power, the south-east slumped into opposition \u2013 a role it has shown a lack of artistry and tact to handle. There is also the south-south quandary. With the south-south emerging as a redoubtable power bloc, the south-east lost its bearing and place as the \u2018\u2019beautiful bride\u2019\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe south-east regaining its place means it must look beyond a solitary party. It must put itself in the thick of things. And to sit at the table, it should discard isolationist politics and work with Nigerians across regions and parties \u2013 as it did in the past. It must forge new alliances \u2013 a political and social concordat.\n\nOJUKWU\u2019S VICTORY IN DEFEAT\n\nAlthough Ojukwu lost the election, his participation in the exercise was of consequence. His participation showed manifest belief in Nigeria. A non-believer in a united Nigeria will not seek to be the country\u2019s president. So, the involvement of Ojukwu, being a former separatist leader, in the election exemplified a reformed mindset committed to building a Nigeria where justice and equity reigns.\n\nIn a 2017 broadcast, President Buhari revealed his conversation with the late Ojukwu on Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u201cIn 2003 after I joined partisan politics, the late Chief Emeka Ojukwu came and stayed as my guest in my hometown Daura. Over two days we discussed in great depth till late into the night and analysed the problems of Nigeria. We both came to the conclusion that the country must remain one and united.\u201d\n\nWhatever change we seek is in the ballot and not in the barrel of a gun. Ojukwu\u2019s victory is the personal example he showed by participating in elections and chaperoning a political party \u2014 APGA \u2014 long after the war. He buried the hatchet and looked to a new future in a united Nigeria. The party stands to date. We should emulate him.\n\nBy Fredrick \u2018Mr OneNigeria\u2019 Nwabufo\n\nTwitter/Facebook/Instagram: @FredrickNwabufo",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, the job of a system administrator \u2014 sometimes called a sysadmin or system admin \u2014 had begun to fascinate me. But before we start, a little back story.\n\nMy first experience with system administrators was with the technical support staff in the ICTU/CRPU unit of the University of Benin. Depending on the mood you catch them in, you could get a good-natured, friendly personality or, a trash-talking grump \u2014 most likely the latter.\n\nFast forward to 2021, my job at Techpoint Africa led me to meet people like Karo, a soft-spoken but highly opinionated sysadmin who takes his job seriously and, quite frankly, knows what he is doing.\n\nThe difference was stark, but I still didn\u2019t know what exactly sysadmins did. And I decided to find out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho are System Administrators?\n\nWhen I first began down the rabbit hole called research, I expected to find a pretty complex maze of confusing terms and techy words. In the end, I did find them \u2014 words like awk, Perl, and shell. I also found semi-familiar words like server, network, and information.\n\nBut I discovered an underlying thread, troubleshooting. At the heart of the job of a system administrator is the ability to find solutions to the IT fires an organisation dependent on technology inevitably needs to put out.\n\nKolade Alonge, a former server administrator at MultiChoice, puts it succinctly, \u201cWe are problem solvers.\u201d\n\nMore than that, System Administrators are responsible for the general management and maintenance of computer systems \u2014 servers, storage, CPU, PC \u2014 including software and hardware.\n\nThey manage user accounts, server configurations, install, configure and update software. Essentially, they keep an organisation from falling apart. System Administrators troubleshoot all day, every day.\n\nFor the average sysadmin, the day is spent attending to tickets \u2014 troubleshooting requests \u2014 from users, checking for errors and making sure the server is running perfectly.\n\nIt is quite demanding, requiring sysadmins to have knowledge of computer architecture \u2014 both hardware and software \u2014 and stay abreast of the latest updates to software; constantly think widely for economical solutions for the organisation while trying to maintain some semblance of calm.\n\nThe path to System Administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fatosa Adigun, his journey began in the four walls of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, as a student in the Electrical/Electronics Engineering Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI started as an intern after my national diploma. Even though I was studying Electrical/Electronics Engineering, I was privileged to do my industrial training in an IT firm somewhere in Ikeja. I was posted to the Network and IT Department. I knew I\u2019d end up in the IT field.\u201d\n\nHis love for IT led him to go back to school for a degree in Computer Science, a programme which will end next year.\n\nAlonge\u2019s path was a different one. He studied Computer Science as an undergraduate and began his career as an IT Auditor, but eventually wound up as a System Administrator at Multichoice for the better part of a year. An experience he believes every IT professional should have.\n\n\u201cEvery auditor needs to have that experience of providing service before auditing service.\u201d\n\nAlonge and Adigun agree on one thing, going to university barely gives you 10% of the knowledge you need on the job. Many skills they acquired were primarily learnt as they went along or via courses and certifications they have had to take.\n\nAccording to Alonge, in Nigeria, school will teach you what you need to understand about computer architecture. If you are lucky enough, you get a lecturer good at programming who teaches well.\n\nWhile entry requirements for system administrators are relatively low, companies often prefer to hire persons with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a computer-related course such as computer science, electrical/electronics engineering, or telecommunications and networking.\n\nHowever, according to Olusegun Balogun, an IT Support Specialist, you don\u2019t necessarily have to have those degrees to become a system administrator.\n\n\u201cAt Southgate Technologies, where I did my IT, I had a boss then. He was a subject matter expert in networking, but his first degree was in sociology. It depends first of all on the passion you have for computers, or it could be the first job you landed, and you decided to build a career in IT.\u201d\n\nReal-life experiences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonge recalls receiving a call from his office informing him that his server room was on fire. Thankfully, this was not the case. The problem was with the cooling equipment. The room was quite hot, and the servers had to be turned off to prevent downtime.\n\nHeat is a sworn nemesis of servers. The ideal temperature for a server room is between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius. You also have to be careful not to keep the server room too cold \u2014 very dicey.\n\nApart from the health of the servers, what concerned him most was the fact that fellow staff members would be unable to work.\n\nHe recalls another incident; the backup solution was not working for the file server \u2014 where organisations store their documents and important information. He would have to update the hard drive, a tricky situation that meant that if he failed, not only would important information be lost, he could lose his job as well.\n\nEventually, everything went off without a hitch, with some prayer backing it along the way. He counts this as both his best and worst experience on the job.\n\nFor System Administrators, a problem solved is a highlight of their day. Adigun\u2019s best experience involved solving a network issue for a very important client, a government parastatal which shall not be named.\n\nHis worst experience was a bad boss at a former workplace. His superior shouted at him for a mistake he had inadvertently committed.\n\nHow important are System Administrators?\n\nAccording to Balogun, as long as an organisation\u2019s system depends on IT infrastructure, sysadmins are important. But he also says it depends on the size of the organisation\n\n\u201cSome organisations have in-house administrators because they can afford to hire them. But there are some organisations that cannot afford to keep those engineers in-house, so they just outsource those roles to big organisations.\n\n\u201cUltimately, all organisations, as long as you have some IT setup, routers, switches, LAN, some servers, definitely you will need a system administrator for maintenance. It now depends on the size of the organisation to know whether you are going to outsource or not,\u201d he concludes\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer GFI Software \u2014 a business-IT essential software provider \u2014 IT admins rarely have enough time, find it challenging to work without impacting users, keep everything running smoothly, and find users unpredictable.\n\nThat post was made in 2014, and if Adigun\u2019s statements are factual, it remains the norm. For him, the job is quite time-consuming. Sometimes, he has had to leave the office at 10 p.m. He also finds dealing with users in other departments stressful and keeping up with updates to the software.\n\nAlonge identifies scenarios where an organisation wastes money to get gadgets that might not be needed or repair systems that can be repaired with a bit of technical know-how.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the gadgets; it\u2019s about the knowledge,\u201d he says.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAs is the natural progression of things, technology has evolved over the years. Many jobs now involve a lot more automation than they did in the last 10, 20 years.\n\nCan AI take over the job of a sysadmin? Experts disagree, at the very least not until AI does not need the input or guidance of a human being.\n\nA Medium post by mindsync explains this quite well, \u201cIn order to use the algorithms effectively, you need the talent of a living person (it\u2019s not enough to just teach the algorithm on a sample, you need to understand the business context, data features, and be able to interpret the results correctly).\u201d\n\nBoth Adigun and Alonge agree with this assessment\n\nSystems Administrators Appreciation Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you are probably wondering. Why are we talking about sysadmins?\n\nToday, Friday, July 30, 2021, is the 22nd annual System Administrator Appreciation Day. Ted Kekatos created it.\n\nKekatos was inspired by an HP magazine ad in which a system administrator is presented with flowers and fruit-baskets by grateful co-workers as thanks for installing new printers \u2014 the same model he had just installed at his workplace.\n\nIt is a day created specifically to appreciate the tireless and sometimes thankless job that sysadmins do, 24 hours a day, 365 \u2014 or six \u2014 a year.\n\nOn the website, it says: \u201cProper observation of SysAdmin Day includes (but is not limited to): cake & ice cream, pizza, cards, gifts, words of gratitude, custom t-shirts celebrating the epic greatness of your SysAdmin, balloons, confetti, did I say gifts?\u201d\n\nSo, to all sysadmins, up at 3 a.m. trying to work out a server downtime issue, or racking your brains, trying to find the answer to a firewall problem, we say thank you.\n\nAnd most of all, we say a big thank you to Muyiwa Matuluko, Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant and Ognenekaro Obrutu, former Technical Product Lead, for putting out our IT fires \u2014 which we may or may not cause ourselves.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are all LoftyInc Capital Management (LCM) portfolio companies, one of the oldest venture capital firms in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom inception to commercialisation, LCM claims to leverage global partnerships and standards to ensure that investments are impact-driven. LCM says it applies technological innovations to Africa\u2019s most pressing problems with skilled indigenous and returning world-class African teams.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Wole Odetayo, Idris Ayodeji Bello, Dami Agboola, and Michael Oluwagbemi, the firm partnered with the Africa Leadership Forum to launch Wennovation hub to provide technology support to Africa\u2019s social impact sectors.\n\nHow does LoftyInc get deals? Bello revealed that there are five major sources of deals for the firm. With a strong network at home and in the diaspora, the firm gets access to startups building amazing startups.\n\nHe also disclosed that founders who have been funded frequently refer other founders to them.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Idris Ayodeji Bello, a Managing Partner at the firm to get an insight into the firm\u2019s activities.

Although dyslexia may co-occur with eye and vision conditions, these conditions are unrelated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat then is dyslexia? Dyslexia is a learning disability. Per the International Dyslexia Association, it is a \u201clanguage problem that refers to a cluster of symptoms that result in people having difficulties with specific language skills, particularly reading.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? Caused by a deficiency in the brain\u2019s ability to convert visual or auditory input into comprehensible language, dyslexia impacts reading comprehension and fluency, writing, memory, listening, and executive functioning in the workplace or school.\n\nBesides, dyslexics may struggle with spoken language, even after being exposed to positive language models at home and receiving appropriate language training in school.\n\nThey may have difficulty expressing themselves clearly or fully comprehending what others say. While such language difficulties are difficult to identify, they can cause significant difficulties in education, the workplace, and interpersonal relationships.\n\nHence, the need to adopt tech tools to help them perform better. Last month, we discussed how assistive technology helps people with learning disabilities to unleash their potential.\n\nThis is an excellent time to revisit it: The unique case of Africans with learning disabilities and assistive technology.\n\nMany assistive technologies exist to aid dyslexics with reading, writing, and organising their work or events, but we highlighted four tools that help them succeed academically and professionally.

Google has announced a new policy update on the Android Play Store to support user control, privacy, and security, beginning September 1, 2021.\n\nThe new update prohibits apps focused on \u201ccompensated sexual relationships.\u201d \u201cSugar dating\u201d apps will no longer be allowed on the Android Play Store as part of a series of platform policy changes.\n\nIs the old policy similar? Before announcing the update, Google\u2019s Play Store policies already prohibited apps promoting \u201cservices that could be interpreted as providing sexual acts for a fee.\u201d\n\nHowever, the updated policy includes \u201ccompensated dating or sexual arrangements in which one participant is expected or implied to provide money, gifts, or financial support to another participant.\u201d\n\nWhile Google didn\u2019t announce why the apps are being prohibited on its Store, there has been a significant rise in efforts to prevent sex work in the United States.\n\nSince implementing the FOSTA-SESTA legislation in 2018, the protections granted to online content for the promotion or facilitation of prostitution have been revoked.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with the new update, Google is providing a Developer Preview of app set ID for critical use cases like analytics and fraud prevention. Also, the search giant is adding new restrictions to its Family Policy which is aimed at children.\n\nIt is also adding a new section to its Enforcement Policy that will allow it to close inactive or abandoned developer accounts after one year of inactivity, among other things.\n\nGoogle claims that with its User Data Policy update, it will be illegal to link persistent device identifiers to personal and sensitive user data or resettable device identifiers unless for pre-approved use cases.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nFacebook Gave Investors 10.4 Billion Reasons To Be Happy\u2014But Its Stock Sank Anyways.

For others, it might be the non-stop chatter between overly familiar people journeying through life, hand in hand.\n\nWhatever the shape or form it takes, friendships require the fresh air of something called \u2018communication\u2019, without which many relationships would wither and die.\n\nFrom pen friends in ancient times to cloud friendships of this day and age, solid friendships have always relied on one medium or the other for communication, interaction, and exchange of information.\n\nFormerly known as \u2018World Friendship Day\u2019, the United Nations (UN) in 2011 declared July 30 as the \u2018International Day of Friendship\u2019 to celebrate the role that friendship plays in promoting peace across different cultures and backgrounds.\n\nWhen social media hardly existed, it was championed by the greetings card and letter writing industry.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIn June I wrote an article to warn APC that it will lose Anambra, Ekiti and Osun elections. My advice was ignored. Supreme Court ruling on Akeredolu versus Jegede has vindicated me. By this judgment, it is clear that APC is out of Anambra 2021 governorship election.\n\nAPC has conducted its party primary for Anambra-2021 under Buni and that is illegal now. If APC conducts its primaries for Ekiti-2022 and Osun-2022 elections, it will lose because caretaker committee is strange to APC constitution. Caretaker committee is illegal.\n\nThe leadership of the party the All Progressives Congress, APC must act fast to avoid a situation where all their candidates for Anambra, Ekiti and Osun gubernatorial elections 2021-2022 will be disqualified and even lose their seats to the opposition if they win the main election. I am worried over Kolapo ALIMI in Osun who was illegally suspended on social media in Osun State at a time when the party wants to get more members. APC constitution does not recognize caretaker committee talk less of their activities. The tenure of APC chairman in Osun expired in 2018. Gboyega Famodun; the Chairman of the caretaker committee of the party in Osun is acting illegally, mismanaging APC plurality, the equivalent of sowing seeds of discord among members, and it is strange to APC constitution.\n\nAPC will lose Anambra, Ekiti, Osun Gubernitorial Elections because the All Progressives Congress National Working Committee organized a strange meeting in a strange location, Federal Executive Council Chamber and took a strange decision not known to the APC constitution to wit: dissolution of NWC. The Party also set up a strange body called a caretaker committee, sworn in by a strange person, Attorney General of the Federation, who by APC constitution is not allowed to hold a party position. APC is preparing to conduct party primaries for Anambra 2021, Osun and Ekiti 2022 elections with an illegal caretaker that is strange to the party constitution.\n\nAPC will lose Anambra, Ekiti, Osun gubernitorial elections because \u201cthe APC constitution provides in Article 18(iv) \u201cNo officer in any organ of the Party shall hold executive position office in government concurrently.\u201d The word dissolution is not in the APC constitution, that the action of dissolution is unlawful and illegal.\n\nAPC will lose Anambra, Ekiti, Osun gubernitorial elections because\u201d dissolving elected party administrators in a wrongly constituted meeting is a coup against the constitution of the party,\u201d \u201cthe Caretaker Committee membership is also a violation of the Article 18(iv), which forbids an elected governor from holding a party position.\u201d\n\nFurther, that this \u201cillegal appointment and oath administered to the governor of Yobe is a violation of his oath of office as governor and a gross abuse of his office as governor. He should resign and rescind that oath immediately.\u201d I want to demand that parties should keep to their constitutions.\n\nThe practice of democracy in Osun APC is today a mockery to democratic principles. Governor Oyetola and Gboyega Famodun; the Chairman of the caretaker committee of the party in Osun, want to stop democratic ethos and institutions that promote and defend mass participation and rule of law in Osun APC. These duo and their hangers-on do not want members of Osun APC to freely choose candidates for elective offices within party. All they want is the imposition of themselves and their favorites through dubious consensus, on the Party.\n\nMembers of APC respected the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the Oshiomhole-Led NWC, and his instruction that no member of the party must approach the courts to resolve any party related case for now, and even those already in court should withdraw their cases. President Buhari knew the legal implication of his action against Oshiomhole.\n\nHowever, all it takes is for one dissatisfied member to approach the court to determine if the decision reached by a caretaker executive or leadership at the ward, local government and state level (which by the way is not recognized by the party constitution, talk less of one whose tenure had originally expired) is in tandem with the constitution of the APC and by extension, if all the decisions taken by them in the course of holding sway is valid or null and void.\n\nA simple case of fighting the suspension of a party member can snowball into removal of elected officials. While I\u2019m not advising aggrieved party faithful to approach the courts, it is important for APC leaders to discourage a situation where arbitrary decisions are made against law abiding party members in Osun and others.\n\nMy attention has been drawn to a purported suspension Kolapo Alimi by the APC caretaker committee in Osun State, Elerin, ward 9, Irepodun South LCDA, Erin-Osun, State of Osun. The purported suspension of Alimi Kolapo came to me as a rude shock because according to Article 21 of APC Constitution, \u201cSUSPENSION\u201d is categorized under \u201cPUNISHMENT\u201d and before any member could be punished, such a person ought to have been alleged of any form of misconduct against the party and ought to be given the opportunity to defend him/herself.\n\nIn the instant case, nobody has accused him of any misconduct either orally or by writing, formally or informally. And he was not invited by any Committee of the party, either at ward, Local Government level or at State Level to come and defend any allegations whatsoever.\n\nHowever, I need to state a fact that might be the root cause of this suspension, the Chairman of Alimi\u2019s ward, who coordinated the suspension under the heavy presence of the Police, Mr Tajudeen Adebayo a.k.a Lekosta is the immediate younger brother to S.A sanitation to Governor Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nI want to state clearly that APC WILL LOSE ANAMBRA, EKITI, OSUN GUBERNITORIAL ELECTIONS 2021-2022 because of its disregard to the relevant provisions of APC Constitution and the 1999 constitution of Nigeria as amended.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Osogbo, Osun State via inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJohannesburg \u2014 On July 28 internationally acclaimed Nigerian author and renowned feminist, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie presented the second University of Cape Town (UCT) Vice-Chancellor\u2019s Open Lecture titled The Idolatry of Theory: A Defense of Storytelling.\n\nBut the university\u2019s Students\u2019 Representative Council (SRC) held a parallel lecture to boycott Ngozi Adichie, whom they accused of transphobia, with guest speaker Dr Anastacia Tomson who spoke on \u201cthe dangers of sectional feminism in the context of trans women\u201d.\n\nThey boycotted Ngozi Adichie\u2019s lecture because of an interview with BBC in 2017, where she said \u201ctrans women are trans women\u201d in response to a question about whether she considers trans women as real women. She apologised after getting a backlash. She was criticised by members of the LGBTQIA+ community for the comment, saying she is transphobic and her feminism is \u201clacking intersectionality\u201d.\n\nThe SRC said, in a statement, that: \u201cAs an institution which actively promotes intersectional feminism through its curriculum, it is important for us to recognise that Ngozi Adichie enhanced the divide in the feminist community with her anti-trans remarks, instead of using her platform and influence to highlight how trans women also have a right to simply be recognised as who they are without having to defend their womanhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe argument that transwomen are different from cis women assumes that trans women did not experience any form of discrimination prior to transitioning,\u201d the SRC tweeted.\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: A cisgender person is a person whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth. For example, someone who identifies as a woman and was identified as female at birth is a cisgender woman. It is often abbreviated to \u201ccis\u201d.)\n\nIn their parallel lecture which they called a \u201csafe space\u201d, the SRC clarified that the boycott was not about \u201ccancel culture\u201d but a call for institutions like UCT to support people like Ngozi Adichie who have anti-trans views and sideline affected people.\n\nThe request that the VC Mamokgethi Phakeng change her as the speaker in solidarity with transgender students and staff at the institution fell on deaf ears.\n\nAccording to News24, UCT viewed the lecture as an opportunity for debate and different perspectives on the same issue.\n\nPhakeng has also been criticised on social media for having the rainbow flag as part of her Twitter bio, yet \u201cshe entertains people with anti-trans views\u201d.\n\nLorde @TshepiMamashela The rainbow flag in the Twitter name and CNA as a guest speaker will never make sense.\n\nCall Me J4M4L @CallMeJ4m4l UCT said let\u2019s give the known TERF and transphobe with her entry-level feminism a platform. That Pride Flag is clearly just for varbs.\n\nNkgono Neria @neriahlakotsa Read the room. Respect Trans people. Stop being arrogant. Noone needs to hear Chimamanda.",

          "text": "BEDC Electricity Plc (BEDC), has decried the rising cases of vandalism across its franchise zone which it says aside being an economic crime is an act of sabotage against the good purpose and intents of the company, canvassing that the effects of vandalism should stimulate tougher laws to be enforced to protect public property, especially electricity infrastructure.\n\nThis information was made available by the company in a press statement signed by the Head, Corporate Affairs, Mr Adekunle Tayo, where he appealed to members of the public on the need to be vigilant and security conscious on the activities of some unruly elements in the society whose aim is to make life unbearable for them through their nefarious acts.\n\nAccording to BEDC, the power sector has been the most hit in the most devastating manner and the effect of vandalism cannot be over emphasized as residential customers, industries, small and medium scale businesses are being starved of power as a result of the activities of vandals.\n\n\u2018\u2019The recent surge in cases of vandalism within our franchise area calls for greater attention. More worrisome is the fact that these miscreants are continuously innovating new ideas beyond human comprehension to perpetrate their criminal acts. We see the recent vandalism of 14 spans of electricity conductors in Ilu-titun, Southern Ondo state, on a line currently being rehabilitated by the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) as very disturbing. More disturbing is the fact that Okitipupa town was recently thrown into blackout as a result of the vandalism of 20 spans of electricity conductors which occurred between Ode-Aye and Okitipupa. As a company, we see these as acts of economic sabotage against the good intents of BEDC,\u201d he remarked.\n\nAccording to Mr Tayo, BEDC regrets the situation whereby the money that could have been judiciously invested on network upgrade such as energisation of new transformers or construction of new lines to relief existing ones would now be channelled towards replacing the vandalised items. It is indeed unfortunate that revenue that could be used for critical development projects are being used to restore damaged and stolen equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2019We are however not relenting in our quest to overcome this societal issue through improved community relations drive of involving all stakeholders at the grassroots aside ensuring that our facilities are well secured in our bid to arrest this ugly trend,\u201d the statement added.\n\nVandalism of electricity distribution network and other forms of electrical thefts are serious threats to power sector sustainability and economic growth and have been major acts negatively affecting service delivery to customers.\n\nEfforts by BEDC at curbing the menace of vandalism on its network had received a boost with the sentencing of one David James to three years imprisonment by a Benin Magistrate Court 6 in Egor Local Government area of Edo state recently.\n\nOn 3rd July 2021, a 2.5MVA, 33/11KV Injection Substation at Igarra near Auchi, in Edo state was vandalized while RUM, upriser cables, incomer cables etc. were removed by the vandals.\n\nHowever, luck ran out of the vandals as they were arrested by the Police Division at Ogorimagogo in Kogi State and the stolen items were recovered. The arrested suspects were later transferred to SCID Lokoja, while efforts are being made by the Edo State Police Command to retrieve the arrested suspects and exhibits to Edo State where they will be charged to court at the end of Police investigation.\n\nOnly last week there was a reported case of high-tension cable conductor vandalism at Esaba, Otutuaima, Oghangbla and Iuhre-Ogun communities in Ughelli South Local Government area of Delta State. The suspects; Messrs. John Moses, Bako Michel, and Azikewe Festus in these communities were said to have vandalized 65 poles of high tension cable conductors in June this year. They were reportedly charged to Ogwuashi-Uku Magistrate Court on early this month and remanded at Ogwuashi-Uku Correctional Center Ogwuashi-Uku.",

          "title": "Osun PDP: The Long Walk to Justice, By Dr. Longe Oyeleye",
          "text": "On 29th Day of July 2021 the erudite Honourable Justice S.O Oke sat on the much awaited case on the controversial removal of Hon Soji Adagunodo as the Chairman of Osun PDP. The Honorable Justice in his wisdom affirmed that the ongoing appeal filed by the Adeleke group at the court of Appeal in Abuja should be exhausted before giving his judgment on the substantive suit.\n\nThe Court sitting in Osogbo was filled to capacity by supporters of Hon Soji Adagunodo and Adeleke to hear the judgment. The road leading to this point has been rough, difficult and it is obvious that the long walk to justice has not ended.\n\nThe 24 hours leading to the judgment was frenzy, the Adeleke group threw caution to the winds and railed all kinds of accusations against the judge and the judiciary. They even released a fake judgment claiming that it was written by another judge. They accused the incumbent government of attempts to hijack the PDP, all kinds of blackmails and propaganda were flying left and right all in a bid to intimidate the judiciary into submission, hold the party to ransom and delay justice.\n\nWhen the petition against the Honorable Judge failed to hold waters, they proceeded to the Court of Appeal in Abuja and made efforts to arrest the judgment. The three (3) justices who sat on the case were unanimous in their judgment that the Adeleke groups were trying to tie the hands of the judiciary and buy time to hijack the legal proceedings. The Adeleke group has never failed to let everyone know that they could procure judgment with money.\n\nDespite the venomous attacks on his person and sheer pressure up to the night before the sitting, the Honorable Justice followed legal procedures to allow the court of appeal to exhaust its process. The Adeleke Group in their sheer ignorance went into wreck jubilation, without realizing that what they got was a judicial mirage that would soon evaporate.\n\nIt was anticipated that resolving the Chairmanship tussle at the court today would have laid to rest the continued uncertainty of the participation of the party at the coming gubernatorial elections but the Adeleke group in their desperation to subvert the path of justice have just burgled the chance of the party. When the Court of Appeal resolves the issues, if it does not go to the Supreme Court, the case will return back to the lower court for adjudication and the circle to the court of appeal and supreme courts will continue. It is a long walk to justice indeed.\n\nSadly, the PRO of the Party, Hon. Sunday Bisi, who was illegally elevated to the position of the party chairman without due process in his press release accused Hon. Soji Adagunodo of conniving with the APC to wreck the PDP. It is a case of either sheer ignorance or an attempt to give the dog a bad name in order to hang it. It is very clear that it is the Adeleke Group that is trying to subvert the PDP and waste her chances at the polls. The Adeleke Group financed the faceless Rebuilders who sent petitions to the NWC of the PDP accusing him of crimes he did not commit and the NWC without any evidence sprang into action to remove an elected Chairman. It was the Adeleke Group, who forged signatures of SWC members to pass a vote of no confidence on Hon. Soji Adagunodo. It was the Adeleke Group who made a spirited attempt to steal the case file from High Court 4, Osogbo. They were the people who filed an appeal against a judgment that had not been given. We are yet to see the hands of the APC or any other group in all of this desperation to hijack the PDP.\n\nWhen the Bukola Saraki reconciliation committee was inaugurated and he met with representatives of Osun PDP, hope was raised that a political solution would be found for the crisis, but the Adelekes stopped the resolution and forbade the Saraki group from even visiting Osun State. While they made progress at resolving the crisis in Ogun and Lagos State, Osun and Ekiti was locked in the cold through the Adeleke/Fayose tango. Even the South West reconciliation committee led by Gov Olagunsoye Oyinlola was rebuffed by the Adelekes, they failed to attend any of the hearings held in Ososgbo to find a political solution to the crisis. It is sheer ineptitude on the part of Hon. Sunday Bisi or anyone for that matter to have accused the opposition (ruling party) of fueling the crisis in the PDP. The Adelekes are the culprits.\n\nMajor stakeholders had watched with keen interest how Hon. Sunday Bisi working with pathfinder, the Adeleke group within the party, to adopt Senator Ademola Adeleke as the sole candidate of the party for the gubernatorial election. This is a man who jumped bail and has been away from Osun State since 2018. It is obvious that hijacking the party is aimed at getting a consensus ticket for the runaway senator in hope that he would be able to return back to the country and enjoy immunity. It can be recalled with nostalgia several failed announcements of his return and distribution of Ankara to their supporters for his coming during the Ileya holidays. The Adeleke group are either too blind or they are half clever. The APC Government understands the game much more than they give them credit.\n\nAs the debacle hangs on the neck of the PDP, Hon Soji Adagunodo is advised to continue to pursue justice if not for anything to clear his family name from the mud spilled by the Adeleke group. This is very important because every man has a right to prove his innocence not just in the court of public opinion but also in the court of justice. It is expedient to call on the leaders and well-meaning members of the PDP to rise up and take their party from the hands of the usurpers. Head or tail, the Osun PDP is in deep shit!\n\nThis shall be a long walk to justice.\n\nDr Longe Oyeleye,\n\nPDP, writes from Dallas, Texas.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Osun State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sunday Bisi has hailed the ruling of the Osun State High Court, Osogbo which suspended its judgment on the party\u2019s chairmanship tussle till after the Appeal Court in Akure concludes its own ruling, saying that it is a reinforcement of the hope and aspiration of the party to rescue Osun State from its ruinous path.\n\nMr. Bisi stated this in a press briefing shortly after the judgment on Thursday at the party\u2019s secretariat in Osogbo.\n\nHe observed that his acceptance as the bonafide leader of the party in the state can be seen in the tremendous joy expressed by members of the State Working Committee and key leaders who, without any prompting or formal invitation, opted to show unprecedented solidarity in the face of a deliberate attempt by some disgruntled elements in the party to draw it backward\n\nWhile noting that the status quo in the party still stands, Bisi condemned the supporters of the ousted chairman, Olasoji Adagunodo for making themselves pawns in the hands of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state in order to bring about distractions ahead of the coming governorship election in 2022.\n\nHe disclosed that the issue was no more hidden as, according to him, Adagunodo\u2019s supporters have surrendered themselves to the desperate antics of APC in a bid to infiltrate the PDP as the last tread of survival for their collapsing house of fraud.\n\n\u201cThe intended distraction of dragging us to court in the first place is not an option for us. We will not be distracted, we refuse to be distracted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur practice since I took charge as chairman of this PDP is all about our people and the overriding interest of Osun State. We have so far been able to reshape our party and restore hope.\n\n\u201cWe have traversed the length and breadth of the state to reawake and reenergize structures and another support base for our party. These we will continue to do as the only party next in line to assume the mantle of governance in our state.\n\n\u201cLike I said, the motive behind the present gang up against the party is clear. Their aim is to ambush us and jeopardize our chances at the poll next year. This we want to assure them will not see the light of the day. We will work assiduously in line with our objectives and goals as a people, to strengthen the party and confine Apc to the dustbin of history in our dear state.\n\n\u201cTo our party members and supporters, I want to assure you all, on behalf of my colleagues at the level of the State Working Committee, that nothing has changed. And nothing will change. If there is going to be any change at all, it is our candidate becoming the next governor of Osun come next year.\n\n\u201cThis party under our watch will not succumb to evil machinations of whatever guise, no matter where it is hatched.\u201d\n\nJustice Sikiru Oke of the Osun State High Court, Osogbo had suspended and postponed judgment on the matter till after the Appeal Court in Akure concludes its ruling on the case.",

          "title": "In 2003, south-east voted for Obasanjo against Ojukwu \u2013 why?",
          "text": "By Fredrick Nwabufo\n\nThose plunking for secession and advancing hate for the north may not know that the region was once a convenient political ally of the south-east. The political establishment of the 1960s was governed by the north and the south-east in expedient nuptials \u2014 before the January 1966 coup which opened Pandora\u2019s Box. The north and the south-east have had a crossed destiny.\n\nThe politics of the Igbo have not always been suffused with emotions and native prejudices. A good case is the pragmatic entente Nnamdi Azikiwe\u2019s NCNC forged with Ahmadu Bello\u2019s NPC in the 60s \u2013 despite the two parties\u2019 diagonal differences. While Bello\u2019s NPC was ultra-conservative, Azikiwe\u2019s NCNC had a liberal character.\n\nAlso, in 1979 the south-east worked with the north to see the emergence of Alex Ekwueme as Nigeria\u2019s first vice-president under a presidential system of government \u2014 and with Shehu Shagari as president \u2014 less than 10 years after the Nigeria-Biafra civil war. In fact, while Ekwueme was a member of the National Peoples Party (NPP), Shagari was a member of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). But this did not stop the entente cordiale.\n\nAlthough the NPP/NPN alliance later became fractious in 1981, the emergence of an Igbo citizen as vice-president a few years after the war blurred the blot of the Igbo being a conquered people. It was under this arrangement that Odumegwu Ojukwu was allowed to return to Nigeria from exile in Ivory Coast in June 1982. And a year after his return (in 1983) he ran for senatorial office \u2013 but lost.\n\nThe southeast was heuristic in these instances and played realpolitik. But what happened afterwards?\n\nIn the 2003 presidential election in which Ojukwu, the famed Igbo leader, vied, the south-east voted tremendously for his rival \u2013 Olusegun Obasanjo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In fact, Ojukwu\u2019s \u2018\u2019Igbo party\u2019\u2019, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) could not even win governorship elections in the south-east except in Anambra \u2014 the late politician\u2019s native home.\n\nIn Anambra, Obasanjo had 466,866 votes which represent 54 percent of the entire count while Ojukwu had 279,378 \u2013 34 percent of the total tally. In Abia, Obasanjo had 386,748 votes (51.7 percent) while Ojukwu had 260,899 votes (34.9 percent). In Ebonyi, Obasanjo had 752,823 votes (94.5 percent), but Ojukwu polled only 20,525 votes (02.6 percent) within the same range as Muhammadu Buhari who had 16,308 votes in the state.\n\nIn Enugu, Obasanjo had 897,721 votes (79.7 percent) while Ojukwu had 177,050 votes (15.7 percent). And in Imo, Obasanjo polled 656,861 votes (64.6 percent), but Ojukwu had 281,114 votes (27.7 percent). The late Igbo leader\u2019s second attempt in 2007 was also unsuccessful.\n\nObasanjo trounced Ojukwu on his own turf. Why? The election was not so much about Ojukwu, but about the centring of the south-east. The Igbo elite consorted with the PDP which at the time had a national appeal, and they were able to pivot the south-east in the nucleus of national politics.\n\nBut the south-east\u2019s liaison with the PDP over the years has not yielded commensurate dividends in terms of economic and infrastructural developments for the region. The beneficiaries of the PDP years were the elite who had sizeable representations in government.\n\nWith the deracination of the PDP from central power, the south-east slumped into opposition \u2013 a role it has shown a lack of artistry and tact to handle. There is also the south-south quandary. With the south-south emerging as a redoubtable power bloc, the south-east lost its bearing and place as the \u2018\u2019beautiful bride\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe south-east regaining its place means it must look beyond a solitary party. It must put itself in the thick of things. And to sit at the table, it should discard isolationist politics and work with Nigerians across regions and parties \u2013 as it did in the past. It must forge new alliances \u2013 a political and social concordat.\n\nOJUKWU\u2019S VICTORY IN DEFEAT\n\nAlthough Ojukwu lost the election, his participation in the exercise was of consequence. His participation showed manifest belief in Nigeria. A non-believer in a united Nigeria will not seek to be the country\u2019s president. So, the involvement of Ojukwu, being a former separatist leader, in the election exemplified a reformed mindset committed to building a Nigeria where justice and equity reign.\n\nIn a 2017 broadcast, President Buhari revealed his conversation with the late Ojukwu on Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn 2003 after I joined partisan politics, the late Chief Emeka Ojukwu came and stayed as my guest in my hometown Daura. Over two days we discussed in great depth till late into the night and analysed the problems of Nigeria. We both came to the conclusion that the country must remain one and united.\u201d\n\nWhatever change we seek is on the ballot and not in the barrel of a gun. Ojukwu\u2019s victory is the personal example he showed by participating in elections and chaperoning a political party \u2014 APGA \u2014 long after the war. He buried the hatchet and looked to a new future in a united Nigeria. The party stands to date. We should emulate him.",

This is his picture after we arrested him today.\u201d\n\nKYARI sent the biographical information about, and photograph of, CHIBUZO to ABBAS using two different WhatsApp numbers\u2014the second of which KYARI said was his \u201cprivate number.\u201d From that point on, KYARI and ABBAS primarily discussed the arrest and detention of CHIBUZO through WhatsApp on this \u201cprivate number.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving the photograph of CHIBUZO, ABBAS stated, \u201cI want him to go through serious beating of his life.\u201d\n\nKYARI responded, \u201cHahahaha,\u201d and ABBAS replied, \u201cSeriously sir.\u201d KYARI then asked for details about what CHIBUZO did \u201con audio,\u201d which KYARI said was \u201cSo that we will know what to do.\u201d\n\nIn response to KYARI\u2019s question about what CHIBUZO had done to ABBAS, ABBAS sent KYARI an audio message, which is transcribed here, describing how CHIBUZO had tried to steal away a fraud victim (i.e., \u201cthe job\u201d) from him.\n\n\u201cWhat he did is, I have one job. The job want to pay me 500, umm, 75,000 dollars [i.e., $575,000]. He went to message the job behind me because I told him to help me make one document for me to give the job. Then he went\u2014he has a\u2014I gave him the details. Then he went to message the job behind my back and try to divert the money and in this process, he tell the job because of the documents he gave me that I gave the job, he tell the job, \u201cThese document they sent to you before. These people are fake. This money\u2014is me who can help you to get it. Come to me le\u2014bring this money you want to pay these people to me. I\u2019m the only one who can help you,\u201d and all these things to divert the job for himself.\u201d\n\nAfter listening to the message, KYARI wrote, \u201cOk I understand [\u00b6] But he has not succeeded.\u201d\n\nABBAS claimed CHIBUZO had taken some money and provided KYARI with two screenshots, one of which contained the phone number 3054405586 (the phone number CHIBUZO used to contact the Victim Businessperson). The screenshots showed a person contacting the Victim Businessperson and stating that he was providing information to try to \u201chelp\u201d the Victim Businessperson.\n\nKYARI responded, \u201cYeah I understand.\u201d KYARI did not request other information or evidence relating to CHIBUZO\u2019s role in the scheme, ask questions about the nature of the transaction, or ask about why CHIBUZO told the Victim Businessperson that ABBAS was \u201cfake.\u201d\n\nABBAS then told KYARI, \u201cNow the [Victim Businessperson] was skeptic to pay me the money cos he keep attacking the [Victim Businessperson] from his end. Now I can handle the [Victim Businessperson] correctly.\u201d\n\nABBAS further told KYARI that he wanted to pay money to send CHIBUZO to jail for a long time, stating \u201cPlease sir I want to spend money to send this boy to jail, let him go for a very long time.\u201d\n\nKYARI responded, \u201cOk bro [\u00b6] I understand [\u00b6] I will discuss with my team who arrested him . . . And handling the case [\u00b6] We will do something about it.\u201d\n\nABBAS responded, \u201cLet me know how I can send money to the team sir[.] let them deal with him like armed robber.\u201d\n\nKYARI responded, \u201cOK I will send their account details to u.\u201d\n\nABBAS further wrote, \u201cHe betray me and try to take food out my mouth, this is great punishable sin,\u201d and KYARI responded, \u201cYeah bro.\u201d ABBAS then continued, \u201cI want him to suffer for many years.\u201d KYARI responded, \u201cHahahaha [\u00b6] Hahahaha.\u201d\n\nApproximately six minutes later, KYARI provided the account information for a bank account at a Nigerian bank, Zenith Bank, in the name of a person other than KYARI himself. ABBAS responded \u201cOk sir, tomorrow by noon,\u201d indicating that he would make the payment to KYARI\u2019s team by the next day.\n\nOn the same day, ABBAS sent JUMA the photograph of CHIBUZO in custody, which KYARI had sent.\n\nApproximately a month later, on February 19, 2020, KYARI sent a message to ABBAS, saying, \u201cHello hush with [sic] need to talk about the subject under detention with me.\u201d\n\nABBAS asked \u201cShould I call u on this number sir?\u201d to which KYARI replied, \u201cYes call me.\u201d\n\nThe following day, KYARI sent ABBAS multiple photographs of CHIBUZO, including close-up photographs showing a rash or skin disease on CHIBUZO\u2019s torso and arms. ABBAS responded, \u201cI don pity am, make them leave am from Tuesday.\u201d\n\nKYARI wrote, \u201cOk bro, they just brought him from hospital. The fever and the rashes is giving him serious Wahala [\u00b6] He got the disease from other suspects in the cell.\u201d\n\nABBAS responded, \u201cI see am, I no too pity am [\u00b6] That\u2019s what people like him deserve but I go forgive am for God sake.\u201d\n\nIn other words, based on my training and experience with Nigerian Pidgin, ABBAS was essentially stating, in part, \u201cI don\u2019t pity him. That\u2019s what people like him deserve, but I will forgive him for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nBased on the date of the messages and later discussion described in paragraph 150, ABBAS was\u2014on Thursday, February 20, 2020\u2014 requesting that KYARI not release CHIBUZO until Tuesday, February 25, 2020.\n\nABBAS then told KYARI that CHIBUZO\u2019s girlfriend messaged him, trying to raise one million naira to secure CHIBUZO\u2019s release, and said ABBAS promised to contribute 100,000 Naira. KYARI stated \u201cThey were thinking it\u2019s normal arrest that is why they think money can remove him . . . No money can remove him here [\u00b6] Hahahaha.\u201d\n\nABBAS added, \u201cBut it\u2019s better for them to think that way, I like it like that,\u201d and KYARI responded, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nABBAS then said, \u201cNo problem sir from Tuesday he can go,\u201d apparently giving KYARI his blessing to release CHIBUZO from custody.\n\nKYARI responded, \u201cOk bro [\u00b6] We will also keep his phone and other gadgets for some weeks.\u201d\n\nABBAS responded, \u201cYes those ones they should not give him again, those ones are gone . . . Make he no see those ones again for life,\u201d instructing KYARI not to return CHIBUZO\u2019s electronic devices.\n\nKYARI responded, \u201cYes he will not see it [\u00b6] again,\u201d indicating that he would accede to ABBAS\u2019 request.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Nigeria Police Force Thursday acknowledged receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against DCP Abba Kyari.\n\nBlueprint also gathered that the police hierarchy would be setting up a high-power panel to interrogate the propriety or otherwise of the allegation brought against Kyari by Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO) CP Frank Mba said the Inspector General of Police Usman Alkali Baba has ordered internal review of Hushpuppi\u2019s claims.\n\nMba, who disclosed this in a statement Thursday in Abuja, said: \u201cSequel to the receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against one of the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, DCP Abba Kyari, the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba psc (+), NPM, fdc has ordered an internal review of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Force reaffirms its commitment to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners.\n\n\u201cFurther developments on this case will be communicated to members of the public accordingly.\u201d\n\nU.S Court\n\nA court in the United States of America had issued a warrant of arrest on Kyari over his alleged links to Hushpuppi.\n\nA spokesperson in the United States Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed that the warrant was issued by U.S Magistrate Judge Otis Wright.\n\nKyari had arrested and jailed one Chibuzo Vincent, an estranged co-conspirator in a $1.1million fraud case at the behest of Hushpuppi.\n\nThe DCP also allegedly sent a bank account to Hushpuppi reportedly for the payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\n\nThe trial\n\nHushpuppi, who had pleaded guilty to the multi-million dollar fraud charges filed against him by the United States government, risks 20 years in prison.\n\nHe reportedly explained how the proceeds from the crime were spent leading to the indictment of DCP Kyari.\n\nAccording to the indictment, \u201cAbbas was assisted in laundering the proceeds of the fraud by Rukayat Motunraya Fashola, a.k.a. Morayo, 28, of Valley Stream, New York, and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka, a.k.a. Bolamide, 34, of Linden, New Jersey. These two defendants also were arrested on July 22, 2021, by FBI agents.\n\n\u201cApproximately $230,000 of the stolen funds allegedly were used to purchase a Richard Mille RM11-03 watch, which was hand-delivered to Abbas in Dubai and subsequently appeared in Hushpuppi\u2019s social media posts.\n\n\u201cOther illicit proceeds from the scheme were allegedly converted into cashier\u2019s checks, including $50,000 in checks that were used by Abbas and a co-conspirator to fraudulently acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship, as well as a passport for Abbas obtained by creating a false marriage certificate and then bribing a government official in St. Kitts.\n\n\u201cCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma were engaged in fraud. After this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force, who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest.\n\n\u201cKyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment,\u201d the US court document read in part.\n\nI\u2019m innocent \u2013 Kyari\n\nCountering the claims in a Facebook post Thursday, DCP Kyari denied the allegations, assuring he would be vindicated at the end of the travails.\n\nThe senior police officer said he did not demand any money from Hushpuppi. He, however, said he introduced the accused to a cloth seller whom Hushpuppi paid about N300, 000.\n\nThe Facebook post reads in part: \u201cFriends: Abbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about two years ago that somebody in Nigeria seriously threatened to kill his family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s phone number and pleaded we take action before the person attacks his family.\n\n\u201cWe traced and arrested the suspect and after investigations we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life and they were long time friends who had money issues between them hence we released the suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThe native clothes and caps (five sets) were brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the suspect when we discovered there was no life threat from the Suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\u201d\n\nKyari further stated that, \u201cFor those who are celebrating that this is an indictment on us and mentioning some fictitious big money they will be disappointed once again as our hands are clean and our record of service for two decades is open for everybody to see.\n\n\u201cThey will continue seeing us serving our father land and we will continue responding to all distress calls from all Nigerians provided they are life threatening.\u201d",

          "text": "The International Space Station (ISS) was destabilised after engines of a newly-arrived Russian module inadvertently fired up, officials say.\n\n\u201cMission control teams corrected the action and all systems are operating normally,\u201d US space agency Nasa said.\n\nThis was done by activating thrusters on another module of the ISS. An investigation is now under way.\n\nUS and Russian officials said that the seven crew members aboard the space station were never in any danger.\n\nThe malfunction happened several hours after Nauka module docked with the ISS on Thursday, following an eight-day flight.\n\nNasa tweeted that \u201cthe module\u2019s thrusters started firing at 12:45pm ET (16:45 GMT) inadvertently and unexpectedly, moving the station 45 degrees out of attitude\u201d.\n\nIt added that \u201crecovery operations have regained attitude\u201d and that \u201cthe station is back in attitude control and is in good shape\u201d.\n\nCommunications with the ISS crew were lost for several minutes during the incident. However. they \u201creally didn\u2019t feel any movement\u201d as the space station pitched at half-a-degree a second.\n\nThe mishap forced Nasa and Boeing to push back an uncrewed test flight of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft to the ISS from 30 July to at least 3 August.\n\nThe 13m-long, 20-tonne Nauka was earlier attached to the rear of the orbiting platform, linking up with the other major Russian segments on the station.\n\nThe module should have launched in 2007, but the vessel suffered repeated slips in schedule, in part because of budget difficulties but also because engineers encountered a raft of technical problems during development.\n\nEven after it launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan a week ago, it experienced propulsion issues that required workarounds from controllers in Moscow.\n\nIn the end, however, it docked with the station on the planned date.\n\nThe new module will result in a significant boost in habitable volume for the ISS, raising it by 70 cubic metres.\n\nCosmonauts will use the extra space to conduct experiments and to store cargo. They\u2019ll also use it as a rest area, and it has another toilet for crew to use on the station.\n\nIn addition, the module carries with it a large robotic arm (ERA) supplied by the European Space Agency (Esa).\n\nThis 11m-long device will be able to operate all around the Russian end of the ISS. With the aid of an \u201celbow\u201d joint, it will shift position by moving hand over hand.\n\nNauka\u2019s installation comes just as Russia has been questioning its future role in the ISS project.\n\nMoscow officials recently warned about the more-than-20-year age of some of their on-orbit hardware and intimated the country could pull out of the station in 2025. And Russia has shown little interest in joining the US-led lunar platform, known as the Gateway, which will be assembled later this decade.",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s Tatjana Schoenmaker was the star of the day, setting the first individual swimming world record at the Tokyo Olympics on Thursday.\n\nOthers shone, too.\n\nEvgeny Rylov completed a backstroke double for Russia, Emma McKeon gave the Aussie women another gold, and China earned a return trip to the top of the medal podium.\n\nThe mighty Americans? For the first time in the meet, they spent the entire session Friday watching others win gold.\n\nSchoenmaker, a 24-year-old South African, won the women\u2019s 200-meter breaststroke with a time of 2 minutes, 18.95 seconds, breaking the mark of 2:19.11 set by Denmark\u2019s Rikke Moller Pedersen at the 2013 world championships in Barcelona.\n\nIt was the third world record at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre, with the first two coming in women\u2019s relays.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that at all,\u201d said Schoenmaker, who added to her silver in the 100 breast. \u201dIt couldn\u2019t have been a better race. It still just doesn\u2019t sink in, maybe one day.\u201d\n\nRylov thoroughly snuffed out America\u2019s dominance in the backstroke, adding the 200 title to his victory in the 100 back.\n\nRylov won with an Olympic-record time of 1:53.29, while American Ryan Murphy wound up with the silver (1:54.15).\n\nMurphy was a double-gold medalist at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where he extended an American winning streak that began at the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\nMcKeon touched first in the 100 freestyle with an Olympic-record time of 51.96, becoming only the second woman to break 52 seconds in the sprint.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Siobhan Haughey earned the silver in 52.27, while another Aussie, Cate Campbell, took the bronze in 52.52. American Abbey Weitzeil was last in the eight-woman field.\n\nThe Australians have won four individual women\u2019s events at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre, in addition to setting a world record in a 4\u00d7100 free relay that included both McKeon and Campbell.\n\nThe team from Down Under has six golds overall, tied with the Americans, though the U.S. has the lead in the overall medal count.\n\nThe Americans won three medals Friday, also claiming the other two spots on the podium behind Schoenmaker.\n\nBut it was the first time the U.S. team went through an entire sessions of finals in Tokyo without winning at least one gold.\n\nLilly King set a blistering pace early in the 200 breast and held on for a silver in 2:19.92, adding to her bronze in the 100 event. Annie Lazor nabbed the bronze in 2:20.84.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t come from behind, that\u2019s for sure, so I just wanted to put it out there and see where it goes,\u201d King said. \u201cI thought I did great.\u201d\n\nA day after winning its first two golds at the pool, China picked up another victory when Wang Shun touched first in the men\u2019s 200 individual medley.\n\nWang edged Britain\u2019s Duncan Scott with a time of 1:55.00. Scott took the silver in 1:55.28, while the bronze went to Switzerland\u2019s Jeremy Desplanches in 1:56.17.\n\nIt was another disappointment for hometown star Daiya Seto, who didn\u2019t even qualify for the final of his first two events. He got through in the 200 IM, but just missed out on a medal with a fourth-place finish \u2014 a mere five-hundredths of a second behind the Swiss bronze medalist.\n\nAmerican Michael Andrew led after the third leg, powering to the top spot on the breaststroke. But he faded badly on the freestyle to wind up in fifth, more than 2 seconds behind the winner.\n\n\u201cI think it hurt worse than it looked, and it looked pretty bad,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cI knew I had to be fast at the 150 and I was praying for some Holy Spirit power to get me home in that (final) 50, but it wasn\u2019t all there.\u201d\n\nBut the U.S. has several good chances to claim gold over the last two days of the swimming competition.\n\nCaeleb Dressel has two individual finals remaining, and Katie Ledecky is a big favorite in the 800 free.\n\nDressel set another Olympic record in the semifinals of the 100 butterfly.\n\nMinutes after Hungary\u2019s Kristof Milak took down the mark in the first semifinal heat, Dressel went even faster with a time of 49.71 in the second heat.\n\n\u201cI feel fine,\u201d Dressel said. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the schedule. I\u2019ve had it written down for a couple weeks now. I know what\u2019s coming. I know how to pace it correctly. I know how to take care of my body.\u201d\n\nIt was the third-fastest time in history and left Milak as the second-fastest qualifier at 50.31.\n\nIn the preliminaries, Dressel tied the former Olympic record of 50.39 set by Singapore\u2019s Joseph Schooling to win gold at the 2016 Rio Games.\n\nDressel will be a big favorite in Saturday morning\u2019s final, though he could get pushed by Milak. The Hungarian already won the 200 fly with a dominating victory.\n\nDressel picked up the first individual gold medal of his career with a win in the 100 freestyle.",
