          "text": "Amarachi Okey\n\nA sexual and reproductive health expert, Dr. YemiAdeyemi has said that using sex toys could reduce stress and give relief from menstrual cramps.\n\nAccording to Adeyemi, sex toys can also help boost moods and release sexual tension.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise in an interview, the sexual reproductive health expert, however, warned that sex toys should not be shared because they could be a rich source of sexually transmitted infections.\n\nAccording to Health Shots \u2013 an online health information medium \u2013 sex toys can help reduce chances of STDs to almost zero, as there is no human intervention in its use and thus prevents viruses like HPV and HIV.\n\nHealth Shots also stated that sex toys can help reduce stress, improve libido and solve the problem of vaginismus \u2013 unbearable pain during penetrative sex.\n\nAlso sharing her experience on the use of sex toys with PUNCH Healthwise, Zainab (not real name) corroborated the view of Dr. Adeyemi, noting that the toys help her to ease tension and reduce stress.\n\n\u201cYes, it reduces stress. It also helps prevents infections because you are not worried about an unfaithful partner,\u201d Zainab said.\n\nZainab told our correspondent that she is open with her decision to use sex toys revealing that her partner, who loves trying new things, is aware and comfortable with her using sex toys.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we use them together. We love trying new stuff,\u201d she said.\n\nZainab also stated that she is not worried about getting a sexually transmitted infection from sharing her sex toys with her partner.\n\n\u201cWell, to some extent I trust my partner and whenever we want to share, I clean it up. If it involves penetration, we use a condom,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso sharing her experience with PUNCH Healthwise, OmolayoAiyelabola,owner of an online sex toy store, Intimates by Amope, agreed that sex toys relieve stress and tension.\n\n\u201cSex toys help reduce stress. Many women do not cum or orgasm via penetrative sex.So many women are not satisfied with their sex lives, hence the need to use the toys to be fine.\n\n\u201cWhen you use the right sex toys, it has a way of calming you down. It is amazing really.\n\n\u201cIf you are very tired and exhausted and you just use your sex toy to relieve the tension, and you are able to reach orgasm, you will sleep like a newborn baby.\n\n\u201cIt has happened to me on several occasions and I have had people send me reviews saying, \u2018Oh my goodness, Amope, after I finished using it, I just slept off\u2019.\n\n\u201cSome women have also said that using sex toys has helped them reduce menstrual cramps. They said that when they use their sex toy during their menstruation, it brings about a huge relief for them.\n\n\u201cI also believe It helps to reduce sexually transmitted diseases in people that do not want to cheat.\n\n\u201cThis applies to both male and female gender. When I know I can always get myself a sex toy when I need to relieve tension, why would I want to cheat?\n\n\u201cIt actually reduces sexually transmitted diseases but it is only among partners who know that they do not want to cheat.\u201d\n\nDr. Adeyemi, however, reiterated that sex toys should not be shared, noting that those sharing the intimate toys put those using them more at risk of STDs.\n\n\u201cThis is because some of the body fluids could remain on the device and this is a rich medium for the transmission of infection,\u201d Adeyemi said.\n\nThe physician added that women sharing sex toys are also at risk of yeast infection, noting that users should also pay attention to the quality of the material used to produce the toy.\n\n\u201cEnsure that the material used to make the product is body-safe.\n\n\u201cThe recommendation is non-porous materials like silicone, glass, stainless steel. Finally, ensure you clean them well and keep them in a dry, aerated place,\u201d Adeyemi said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "No fewer than 15 Borno indigenes in the internally-displaced persons (IDP) camp in Uhogua, Ovia North-East Local Government Area of Edo, have been forced out of school by management of the camp due to financial challenges.\n\nReports have it that the IDPs, who dropped out of schools, were in various levels in different tertiary institutions across the country.\n\nSome of the drop-outs, who spoke with Newsmen in tears, expressed sadness that their hope of attaining education so that they could be useful to themselves, the society and the country had been cut short.\n\nThey appealed to Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno to come to their aid so that they could continue their education.\n\nJohn Ayuba, an IDP from Gworza in Borno, disclosed that for more than two years, the IDPs of Borno origin in the camp had tried in several ways to reach Zulum to appeal to him to take over their education and help them pay their fees.\n\nAlso Read: Kano Assembly suspends state\u2019s anti-corruption chair\n\nHe noted that in spite of their efforts, they had gotten no response from the governor, adding \u201cwe don\u2019t know why the governor is not responding to our cries\u201d.\n\nAnother IDP from Borno, Usman Philemon, told Newsmen that the least the government could do for them was to encourage them by sponsoring their education.\n\n\u201cIt is not by our making that we have become IDPs, but since we have found ourselves in this condition, we cannot afford to become useless in life. That is why we have decided to pursue our education.\n\n\u201cWhen we finish, we will come back home to help develop the state and give back to the state its investment in us.\n\n\u201cImagine in this camp, we have about 12 of us from Borno studying Medicine, another 12 studying Law and five studying Chemical Engineering.\n\n\u201cThe management of the camp has been sponsoring us from secondary school up till now, but today, things have become very difficult for us; they can\u2019t meet up with the sponsorship again.\n\n\u201cThis has forced some of us to drop out of school.\n\n\u201cWe are still appealing to our governor to come to our aid and help us achieve our educational dream so that we be useful to the state and become worthy ambassadors,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Coordinator of the camp, Pastor Solomon Folorunsho, told NAN that the 15 IDPs, who dropped out of school, were from the 63 IDPs presently in various higher institutions of learning across the country.\n\nHe explained that it was quite painful to the management that some of them had to stop schooling, adding, however, that it was due to the present realities in the camp.\n\nFolorunsho said that the management of the camp could no longer fund the education of the IDPs due to financial constraints and other challenges which the management was trying to cope with.\n\nHe added that the management of the camp had been responsible for their education since the insurgency forced them out of their state and they found shelter in the camp more than seven years ago.\n\nThe coordinator also stated that the management tried to reach out to some persons and even state governors where the IDPs came from, but no response had been received.\n\nAccording to him, it has been quite challenging from the period of COVID-19, adding \u201cit has been very challenging to pay their fees.\u201d\n\nThe coordinator, however, disclosed that aside from the 15 IDPs from Borno, three from other states were also affected.\n\nSpeaking on the last UTME, the coordinator said that 134 out of the 150 IDPs enrolled were able to write the exams.\n\nHe explained that the 16 IDPs, who didn\u2019t write, couldn\u2019t get their centres until after the exams.\n\n\u201cAs I speak to you, those ones are just hoping that they will be called again to do the exams,\u201d he said.\n\nFolorunsho further disclosed that out of the 134 IDPs, who sat for the examination, more than a quarter scored above 200.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

If you see my picture when I was sworn in, my hair was very black but look at how it has become. This is a very difficult job and that is just state governor, one state out of 36, a big one, yes; a difficult one, yes, but it is not the same as Nigeria,\u201d\n\n\u201cPresidency of Nigeria is a very serious job, it is too much for a 62-year-old,\u201d he said.\n\nOn vying to be the Vice-President, he said: \u201cI have not thought about it at all. I have said it that in the political system we have, after eight years of President Buhari, the presidency should go to the south.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been suffering this presidential ambition suspicion since 2006, I have suffered it for 15 years today, and I am sick and tired of it. There are people that are out to paint me in a particular picture so that, I will be out of the presidential race, but they don\u2019t know that I am not in any race anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have called me all sort of names; they said I am a Hausa-Fulani irredentist, I am Jihadist and all that, Jihadist when? Where? I am not even an active member of any Islamic organization.\u201d\n\n\u201d I am Muslim yes, a devote one but, I believe religion is private.

It was Pastor Tunde Bakare that actually introduced me to Buhari and CPC. I didn\u2019t join the CPC because Buhari lives in Kaduna or he is a northerner.

          "text": "By Luminous Jannamike, ABUJA\n\nAt least, 10 people were arrested after members of the Take-It-Back movement led by a former presidential candidate, Omoyele Sowore, stormed the Dunamis International Gospel Centre church service, on Sunday, to protest against \u2018bad governance\u2019.\n\nVanguard gathered that the church had asked all first-timers to come out for prayers, but the activists trooped out with \u2018Buhari Must Go\u2019 T-shirts, chanting the inscription writing on their clothes and live streaming the drama on social media.\n\nThey reportedly ignored the church administrators pleas to disperse them as they marched through the aisle to the altar.\n\nConsequently, security operatives were drafted in to help disperse the demonstrators because the church service became rowdy.\n\nAlso Read: BREAKING: Sporadic shooting as policemen invade Alaba Int\u2019l Market\n\nHowever, a member of the Take-It-Back movement, Mr Sanyaolu Juwon, accused the leadership of the church of double standards.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe church asked all first-timers to come out for prayers. The patriotic citizens obeyed the clarion call from the Altar with their fully displayed \u2018Buhari Must Go\u2019 shirt.\n\n\u201cThey were immediately apprehended by the church security on their way out of the church and subsequently handed to the DSS.\n\n\u201cKudos to the courageous activists for this creativity. I\u2019m certain if the activists had worn a shirt inscribing \u2018Sai Buhari\u2019, they would have ranked as Pastor Enenche\u2019s new best friend.\n\n\u201cIn revolutionary epochs, the church has always been one with the oppressive state. And this wretched trend has not changed and it\u2019s not likely to change until we create a social system that consciously separates religion from the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, the leader of the group, Omoyele Sowore, criticised the church for demanding that his supporters delete the live-streamed videotapes from social media.\n\n\u201cDr Paul Enenche\u2019s security men and the DSS at Dunamis International Gospel Centre have forced the campaigners to delete the live-streamed videotapes at the church premises,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the media office at Dunamis headquarters, Lugbe, Abuja, confirmed the incident to Vanguard, adding that the church\u2019s leadership would state the matter.\n\nBut as of the time of filing this report, 7:05 pm, the church was yet to release the statement or respond to further inquiries by Our Correspondent.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "A groom with terminal cancer collapsed and died at the altar as his horrified bride walked down the aisle with their son.\n\n\n\nPaul Wynn, 57, a father of eleven children from North Ayrshire, Scotland, collapsed at Saltcoats town hall last Friday just minutes before he was due to be wed to Alison Wynn, his partner of 21 years.\n\n\n\nAccording to Mail Online, Mr. Wynn was originally diagnosed with cancer in May and was later told it had turned terminal eight days before he then decided to marry his partner Alison, 36.\n\n\n\nThe report said he was told he had six weeks and two months left to live by doctors, who told him his pancreatic cancer had spread to his liver and lungs.\n\nOn the day, which was supposed to their wedding, Wynn collapsed at the altar as Alison walked towards him with their son.\n\n\n\nAlison described him as a 'fantastic dad' in a heartfelt tribute following his sudden death. She also revealed that her partner hadn't received any treatment before his death.\n\n\n\nAlison said: 'If I had known we didn't have long I would've tried to arrange the wedding for the beginning of the week. He never actually got any treatment.'\n\n\n\nAlison left her home on the afternoon of Friday, June 25 feeling overwhelmed after organising a wedding at such short notice. She waited 10 minutes outside the town hall for a friend to bring her flowers after she forgot them at home.\n\nAfter collecting them, she went upstairs where she saw the groom, who she said looked uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nShe explained: 'By the time I had gotten my flowers and went up the stairs. Everything seemed to be okay although Paul seemed to be a bit uncomfortable by this point and his kilt had been loosened a wee bit to help him feel more comfortable.\n\n'He had actually been wheeled up in an office chair into the lift and taken up the stairs as he had no energy to get up to the room. He was out of breath and struggling from what I was told.'\n\n\n\nSandy, 20, the couple's eldest child, walked her mother down the aisle after the guests were seated.\n\n\n\nAs Alison started her walk, she realised Mr Wynn had slumped down in the chair.\n\n\n\nShe said: 'By the time I got to him I called his name a couple of times. He didn't turn round, he didn't look at me and I realised there was something wrong and I started breaking down and I started shouting his name and we knew something wasn't right.'\n\n\n\nFirst-aiders also rushed to administer CPR and use a defibrillator - but Mr Wynn couldn't be revived.\n\nReacting to her partner's death, Alison said: 'It was hard. It's taken me a wee while to get to where I am now and every day just seems to merge into one.\n\n'It feels like only yesterday that it happened. I'm having to get up and moving every day for the sake of my children but I can't eat.\n\n'Paul and I lost a child in 2004 after I had a miscarriage so it give me a bit of comfort that he's up there with our child. His mother passed away in 2020 so at least he's with her now too.'\n\n\n\nThe couple had met in 1999, before having an on-and-off relationship.\n\nThey had five kids together, Sandy, 20; Tarquin, 15,",

And for the state, it will not only yield dividends to its treasury but will create thousands of jobs for our teeming youths. I am overjoyed by this new entrant into the aviation sector.\n\n\u201cCally Air took delivery of its first Boeing 737-300 (737-31S, 5N-BYR, msn 29266) on April 6, 2021. A second Boeing 737-300 (5N-BYQ, msn 30334) has also been delivered on April 28, 2020. The two Boeing 737 aircrafts have a carrying capacity of 142 and 144 passengers respectively. And more aircrafts are still underway.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ayade\u2019s decision to establish Cally Air is as a result of the high cost of air fares in the country, particularly the Lagos-Calabar and Calabar Abuja routes where a passenger pays over N70,000 to fly to Calabar. The route to Calabar, either from Lagos or Abuja, is the most expensive in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe governor had said the outrageous charges was due to the non-corresponding surplus of airlines coming into Calabar which was the reason he promptly responded to the yearnings of the people.\n\n\u201cConsidering the tourism potentials in the state, I am sure you understand better than I do, the need to have an affordable and efficient airline plying the route which Cally Air is the right answer to,\u201d Ekpere-Eta said.\n\nEkpere-Eta said Ayade, having created the ministry of aviation was also constructing an airport to support the patronage of international tourists coming to Obudu cattle ranch.\n\n\u201cThe airline, according to the governor, will fly Lagos-Calabar Obudu and Abuja- Calabar-Obudu-Lagos-Abuja routes for now. The two aircrafts will resume operations in few weeks time. So, it is clear that Governor Ayade is not only developing the economic fortunes of Cross River State but putting the state on the global map.\u201d\n\nEkpere-Eta also expressed delight that Governor Ben Ayade has joined the progressive family following his recent defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nShe said with the development, the state would gain from all fronts considering the enabling potentials in the state and President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s disposition towards the governor and the state.\n\nEkpere-Eta noted that even before joining the APC, Buhari has been supportive of Cross River State, which she said was visible in the industrialisation of the state, particularly in the empowerment of women and youths.\n\nOn recent remarks by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Governor Ayade\u2019s decision to join the APC, particularly the quit notice by the National Secretariat of the PDP led by Prince Uche Secondus, Ekpere-Eta said she was not losing sleep over what some disgruntled politicians think of him.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Wilfred Eya, Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa and Chinelo Obogo\n\nThe leadership of Ijaw nation has solicited the support of the British government to break away from Nigeria.\n\nA delegation led by the President of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Prof. Benjamin Okaba, made this known during a meeting with representatives of the British High Commission led by Mr John Kekeh, at the Ijaw House in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State.\n\nIn a seven-page address he presented on behalf of the Ijaw nation, Okaba lamented that the British government has abandoned the Ijaw people after deceiving them to join Nigeria with the assurance that they would be well taken care of.\n\nHe said the people were no longer at ease with the contraption called Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAgain in the light of truth, good conscience, fairness, equity and justice would the British people and her government be perpetually silent and feign ignorance to the excruciating plight of the Ijaw people.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, perhaps the once colonial masters would with all intent and purpose act to rescue the ugly situation- may we ask if not now then when?\n\n\u201cWe are indeed eager and anxious to know: Is your intervention coming when we are completely ripped off of our God-given oil and gas natural resources and abandoned to our fate in a wallowing and criminally degraded environment without remediation?\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, would that not be a crime against humanity where the British government would be seen as accomplices,\u201d he said.\n\nOkaba while reiterating that the Ijaw people would leave Nigeria peacefully and legally called on the British government to come and undo what they did decades ago by forcing them into Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe visitation is about us telling them that you (British) brought us into Nigeria and they should play their role to take us out of this country. The British have the moral duty to take us out. We were deceived to join Nigeria; they abandoned us and deceived us. Let them do the needful. As Ijaw people, we are tired of this country. We have suffered in this country; we have carried the burden of this nation on our shoulders for too long. We have placed minimum conditions. The first condition is the restoration of true federalism. Number two, we have to be placed not as balkanised people. We cannot be scattered into different states and make us minorities and slaves. We cannot be slaves in a place where our resources are used to sustain the people. It is unacceptable. So, Ijaw people are saying to the Federal Government that if this minimum requirement is not met, we are no longer committed to the Nigerian project. And that if we are leaving as Ijaw republic, we shall do it peacefully and legally. This is the message we are sending to British government to come and undo what they did.\u201d\n\nKekeh promised to deliver the message back to the leadership of the British High Commission.\n\nHowever, spokesman, Coalition of Northern Youth Groups, Alhaji AbdulAziz Suleiman, said any tribe or unit that wanted to leave should be allowed to do so to douse the rising tension in the country.\n\nHe called for a general referendum, saying the North was 100 percent in support of any region which wants to secede in peace.\n\nAlhaji Suleiman regretted that there had never been a time Nigerians genuinely sat down to discuss the future of their country.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvery unit that wants to leave should leave. That is why we have supported the people of Biafra to leave. If we allow these old folks to continue to have their way, Nigeria would not go anywhere. Among most African countries, it is only Nigeria that is still clinging to the name given to it by the British.\u201d\n\nBut for the Middle Belt Forum, President Muhammadu Buhari should facilitate the restructuring of the country to halt the quest for secession.\n\nPresident of the forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus said the spate of agitations was because \u201cNigeria is not working for everybody.\u201d\n\nHe called on President Buhari not to midwife the disintegration of the country.\n\nThe Ohanaeze, the apex socio-cultural organisation of Igbo and Afenifere, the umbrella Yoruba organisation, said they believe in one Nigeria that is restructured for fairness, equity and justice.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, Alex Chidozie Ogbonna said the Igbo wants a restructured country that gives equal opportunities to all citizens.\n\nHis colleague in Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said Yoruba did not want to leave Nigeria as it has contributed more than any other group in the development of the country. He said those calling for secession were doing that out of frustration.\n\nReacting, former member of the National Assembly representing Kano Central District, Senator Rufai Hanga, urged President Buhari to immediately call for a national dialogue to address the calls for secession from different parts of the country.\n\n\u201cBuhari is a very stubborn man who lacks capacity and that was why he lost his position during the military regime. If someone is as stubborn as he is, he does not usually see the implication of his actions. I believe that every group has the right to agitate but if I were Buhari, I would call for a National Conference that would lead to a referendum to know which way we are going. Do we want Nigeria to be separated and what would the modalities be? That is the first thing that someone who knows what he is doing should do. You can\u2019t rule people by fiat or force people into doing what they don\u2019t want to do. If you do that, you are inviting perpetual trouble and that is why we are having these problems.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By John Shiklam\n\nSeveral students of Bathel Baptist High School, Damishi, Kaduna, were abducted in the early hours of Monday by bandits who attacked the school.\n\nThe hoodlums were said to have invaded the school at about 2am. The bandits were said to have stormed the school in larger number, armed with sophisticated weapons.\n\nMany of the students are believed to have been abducted, though the number is yet to be determined.\n\nKaduna state Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, who confirmed the incident in a telephone interview, said his son who is also a student in the school, was among some of those who narrowly escaped the bandits.\n\nHe said many of the students were missing, explaining that it is not possible to determine the number of those abducted until those who probably ran into hiding are back and a census of the students is taken.\n\nHe however said many of the students were believed to have been abducted.\n\n\u201cWe cannot give the exact figure of those abducted for now, until those who ran into the hills for safety are back and a census of the students is taken, but we know they took a lot of students.\n\n\u201cI am just speechless, I don\u2019t know what to say! My son was among the students who narrowly escaped.\n\n\u201cI am part of this unfortunate incident because it is my church. This is a very, very sad situation for us.\n\n\u201cI was informed that bandits invaded the school around 2am.\n\n\u201cThey have just started the NECO exam and see what we are going through\u201d, Hayab said.\n\nMohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna state police command, did not respond to telephone calls when contacted.\n\nThe latest attack on the school came less than 24 hours after bandits, in the early hours of Sunday raided the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Centre, Zaria, abducted seven people, includinh a nursing mother.\n\nDetails later\u2026\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Draft electoral bill mandates INEC, security officials to take oaths of neutrality, loyalty\n\n*To swear not to accept bribe\n\n*Party member that seeks appointment into INEC risks jail term\n\n*Nomination of unqualified candidate attracts N10m fine\n\nChuks Okocha and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nConcerns mounted yesterday over what social critics called attempts by federal legislators to rig the 2023 general election ahead of time through the manipulation of the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021.\n\nMany critics who spoke to THISDAY pointed specifically at Section 50 (2) of the draft bill, whose consideration begins tomorrow at the National Assembly, which bars electronic transmission of results.\n\nIn fact, about 22 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have raised the alarm over the alleged plan by the National Assembly to pass the bill without the inclusion of the electronic collation of results in the bill.\n\nThe critics argued that since President Muhammadu Buhari would not be in contention, the lawmakers are working to the answer for their own selfish purpose, calling on Nigerians to resist them.\n\nThe CSOs in a statement yesterday said the manipulation of Section 50(2) undermined the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC)\u2019s efforts to improve the election results management regime.\n\nThe CSOs also expressed concern over the increase in spending limits for presidential candidates and others, saying it is an indication that the National Assembly is committed to entrenching a political system that is heavily monetised.\n\nThey called on the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and House of Representatives Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, to speak up clearly that they are not aware of these amendments and are not part of any attempt to subvert the voices of Nigerians.\n\nThe CSOs urged Nigerians to stand up to resist the attempt by the National Assembly to manipulate the Electoral Act for self-perpetuation and self-interest, adding that they will continue to make the contact information of lawmakers available so that Nigerians can engage their representatives directly.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cEveryone may be aware that the National Assembly will pass the Electoral Amendment Bill (2021) this week. Barring any last-minute changes, the bill is expected to be passed by both chambers on Thursday. Some proposals canvassed by citizens were adopted in the bill e.g. electronic voting, financial independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and new timelines for submission of list of candidates.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are discrepancies between the approved version of the bill and the alleged final copy, where some key provisions have been manipulated.\n\n\u201cIn the alleged final copy, some key priority amendments were rejected by the leadership of the National Assembly, e.g. electronic transmission of results has been prohibited (S.50(2)) and the limits on campaign expenses have been increased (S.88).\n\n\u201cFollowing, the events of the 2019 general elections, we are convinced that INEC needs to have this power in order to prevent politicians from going through the backdoor to win the election and steal electoral mandate at gunpoint!\u201d\n\nThe CSOs include, Centres for Liberty, Electoral Hub, Yiaga Africa, Raising New Voices, Ready to Lead Africa, MACAA, Speak Out Africa Initiative, Centre for Development Alternatives Research and Studies, Aspilos Foundation, Free Nigeria Coalition, Adopt A Goal for Development Initiative, Concerned Nigerians, SING Nigeria, Enough is Enough, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Community Life Project (CLP), FAME Foundation, Women in Politics Forum (WIPF), UTO Foundation,

Development and Social Rights, Move on Nigeria, Institutional and Sustainable Development Foundation and Initiative for Research, Innovation and Advocacy in Development (IRIAD).\n\nThe bill, however, provides that all officials of INEC and security agencies on election duties must swear oaths of neutrality and loyalty before they are sent out to carry out such assignments.\n\nAccording to the bill, any person who violates the provision commits an offence punishable under Section 120 of the bill.\n\nAlso, the harmonised bill specified that a member of a political party that presents himself for employment into the commission risks a two-year jail term or a fine of N5 million or both.\n\nAlso, the new draft bill provides that the deployment of security officials for election duties must be at the instance of INEC.\n\nAccording to Section 26 (1) of the harmonised draft bill sighted by THISDAY, \u201cAll staff, electoral officers, presiding officers, returning officers and security officials taking part in the conduct of an election shall affirm or swear to an oath of loyalty and neutrality as in the Second Schedule, indicating that they will not accept bribes or gratification from any person, and shall perform their functions and duties impartially and in the interest of the Federal Republic of Nigeria without fear or favour.\n\n\u201c(2) Any person who violates subsection (1), commits an offence and is punishable under Section 120 (dereliction of duty).\n\nAlso, Section 27 (1) states: \u201cThe commission shall for the purposes of an election or registration of voters under this bill, appoint and designate such officers as may be required provided that no person who is a member of a political party or who has openly expressed support for any candidate shall be so appointed.\u201d\n\nThe draft legislation also provides that the officers appointed under subsection (1) shall exercise such functions and duties as may be specified by the commission, in accordance with the provisions of this bill, and shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person or authority other than the commission in the performance of their functions and duties.\n\nAccording to the bill, the commission shall be responsible for requesting for the deployment of relevant security personnel necessary for elections or registration of voters and shall assign them in the manner determined by the commission in consultation with the relevant security agencies.\n\nThe bill also stipulates that the commission shall only request for the deployment of the Nigerian Armed Forces for securing the distribution and delivery of election materials and protection of election officials.\n\nThe draft bill said: \u201cA person who, being a member of a political party, misrepresents himself by not disclosing his membership, affiliation, or connection to any political party in order to secure an appointment with the commission in any capacity commits an offence and is liable on conviction, to a fine of N5, 000,000 or imprisonment for a term not more than two years or both.\u201d\n\nThe harmonised draft electoral bill also stipulates that the commission shall, within 60 days after each year, make available to every political party the names and addresses of each person registered during that year.\n\nIt said when a general election is notified by the commission under section 28 of the bill, the current official register of voters certified by the commission in accordance with the provisions of the law shall be the official voters\u2019 register for those elections.\n\nIn the case of every by-election conducted under the bill, it prescribes that the official voters\u2019 register for use at such elections shall be the current register relating to the senatorial district or the constituency concerned.\n\nThe draft bill said the results of all the elections should be announced by the (a)presiding officer at the polling unit; (b) ward collation officer at the registration area or ward collation centre; (c) local government or area council collation officer at the local government or area council collation centre; (d) state collation officer at the state collation centre.\n\nOn how to announce election results, the bill provides that \u201cthe returning officer shall announce the result and declare the winner of the election at (a) registration area or ward collation centre in the case of councillorship election in the Federal Capital Territory; (b) area council collation centre in the case of chairmanship and vice chairmanship election in the Federal Capital Territory; (c) state constituency collation centre in the case of State House of Assembly election;\n\n22(d) federal constituency collation centre in the case of election to the House of Representatives; (e) senatorial district collation centre in the case of election to the Senate; (f) state collation centre in the case of election of a governor of a state; (g) state collation centre in the case of a presidential election; and (h) national collation centre in the case of election of the president, (3) the chief electoral commissioner shall be the returning officer at the presidential election.\u201d\n\nOn the commencement of elections, the harmonised draft electoral bill also provides that \u201cthe commission shall not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding of an election under the bill, publish a notice in each state of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory- stating the date of the election; and appointing the place at which nomination papers are to be delivered.\n\nIt said the notice shall be published in each constituency in respect of which an election is to be held, adding that in the case of a by-election, the commission shall, not later than 14 days before the date appointed for the election, publish a notice stating the date of the election.\n\n\u201cThere shall not be substitution of candidates in a by-election except where a candidate of a political party in a by-election dies, the party shall submit to the commission the name of its substitute candidate within seven days of the death of the candidate in the form prescribed by the commission,\u201d it says.\n\nThe new bill also provides that \u201cevery political party shall, not later than 180 days before the date appointed for the general election under the bill, submit to the commission, in the prescribed forms, the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor at the elections, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political party.\u201d\n\nIt adds: \u201cThe commission shall, within seven days of the receipt of the personal particulars of the candidate, publish same in the constituency where the candidate intends to contest the election.\n\n\u201cAny person may apply to the commission for a copy of the nomination form, affidavit and any other document submitted by a candidate at an election and the commission shall, upon payment of a prescribed fee, issue such person with a certified copy of the document within 14 days.\u201d\n\nIt further provides: \u201cAny aspirant who participated in the primaries of his political party who has reasonable grounds to believe that any information given by his political party\u2019s candidate in the affidavit or any document submitted by that candidate in relation to his constitutional requirements to contest the election is false, may file a suit at the Federal High Court against that candidate seeking a declaration that the information contained in the affidavit is false.\u201d\n\nThe draft electoral bill provides that \u201cwhere the court determines that any of the information contained in the affidavit is false only as it relates to constitutional requirements of eligibility, the court shall issue an order disqualifying the candidate and the sponsoring political party and then declare the candidate with the second-highest number notice of election.\u201d\n\nThe bill further provides that \u201ca political party which presents to the commission the name of a candidate who does not meet the qualification stipulated in this section, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of N10,000,000.\u201d\n\nThe bill says: \u201cA political party shall not be allowed to change or substitute its candidate whose name has been submitted pursuant to Section 29 of this bill, except in the case of death or withdrawal by the candidate, provided that in the case of such withdrawal or death of a candidate, the political party affected shall, within 14 days of the occurrence of the event, hold a fresh primary election to produce and submit a fresh candidate to the Commission for the election concerned.\u201d\n\nThe bill also provides that a candidate may withdraw his or her candidature by notice in writing signed by him and delivered personally by the candidate to the political party that nominated him for the election and the political party shall convey such withdrawal to the commission not later than 90 days to the election.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City, Okon Bassey in Uyo, Sylvester Idowu in Warri, Emmanuel Ugwu-Ogo in Umuahia, and James Sowole in Akure\n\nGroups from oil-bearing communities in Abia, Delta, Edo and Ondo states have demanded an upward review of the three per cent host communities\u2019 fund approved in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which was passed last Thursday by the National Assembly.\n\nClause 240 of the draft bill had proposed five per cent of the annual profit of the oil companies for host communities.\n\nBut shortly before passage, senators reduced the trust fund for host communities to three per cent.\n\nBut in an interview with THISDAY at the weekend, the President-General of Urhobo Progress Union (UPU), Worldwide, Chief Moses Taiga, called for an objective, realistic and patriotic review of the fund to 10 per cent.\n\nHe, however, stated that despite any shortcomings that may be observed, the PIB as passed is a good and practical starting point towards changing the administrative, regulatory and fiscal framework of the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nTaiga commended senators and members of the House of Representatives from the Niger Delta for their roles in ensuring the passage of the PIB.\n\nSecretary of Warri Consultative Forum (WCF), Mr. Amaechi Ogbonna, warned that the three per cent equity approved by the National Assembly for host communities could instigate inter-communal crisis in the Niger Delta region.\n\nOgbonna, an Itsekiri stakeholder, told THISDAY that the three per cent was not the solution to the underdevelopment in the host communities.\n\nAlso, a retired Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) and community leader in Akwa Ibom State, Udom Udo Ekpoudom, told THISDAY that the National Assembly was not fair to the oil-rich Niger Delta region over the PIB.\n\nHe wondered what the National Assembly members from the region were doing to allow only three per cent of the 15 per cent originally allotted to host communities, adding that the National Assembly members from the area have failed their people.\n\nHe urged that the three per cent be reviewed upwards for the sake of peace and justice for the host communities.\n\nHe said: \u201dIf you are from the area affected, you can\u2019t be happy. If you go to a place like Rivers State, you can\u2019t wash your clothes and keep outside because within one hour, it becomes charcoal and they went and approved only three per cent.\n\n\u201dAs such, nobody from the Niger Delta, including myself is happy. The only solution is that the National Assembly should adjust it and make it meaningful. They shouldn\u2019t take us for a ride.\n\n\u201dThey can\u2019t take our oil resources and develop their places and give us a paltry three per cent. It is not fair.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Abia State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (ASOPADEC) has condemned the approval of what it described as a mere three per cent in the PIB, saying that it has fallen short of expectations.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Commission, Mr. Ikechukwu Onwuegbu, said it was a sad development that PIB failed to meet the expectations of oil-bearing communities.\n\n\u201cIt is a bad omen for the oil communities that have been clamouring for a sense of belonging. We are not happy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe wondered why the lawmakers could not accept the 15 per cent increment recommended by the committee but rather settled for three per cent.\n\nAccording to him, the federal lawmakers were insensitive to the plight of oil communities by giving them three per cent while providing 30 per cent for frontier states whereas the reverse should have been the case.\n\nPresident of Benin Solidarity Movement (BSM), Mr. Curtis Ugbo, described the three per cent as grossly inadequate going by the sufferings host communities go through because of exploration and exploitation.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow can you be producing something and someone else who does not have such resources is the one sharing it for you?\u201d\n\nHe blamed Southern leaders for such abnormality, noting that they should instead be asking for the lion\u2019s share of their natural resources.\n\nCivil Rights Activist and President, One Love Foundation, Benin, Mr. Patrick Eholor, described the three per cent stake as unreasonable, adding that it is a ploy to shortchange the goose that lays the golden egg.\n\nEholor, from Ikpoba-Okha, one of the oil-bearing local government areas and host communities, blamed the representatives of the region in the National Assembly for the reduction in the percentage of the trust fund for the host communities.\n\nIn Ondo State, the stakeholders in the oil-producing areas described the three per cent as inadequate and unacceptable.\n\nThey said the approved percentage fell short of their expectations as discussed during stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Ilaje, Ondo State.\n\nA former Chairman of the Ilaje Regional Development Committee (IRDC) that is operating Global Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of NNPC/Chevron Joint Venture, Prince Philemon Ebiessuwa, said the communities were disappointed by the approved percentage.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen the committee came to Ilaje for stakeholders\u2019 meeting, we unanimously presented our position that the host communities should be given five per cent and that was what we stood on.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that the Senate passed the bill proposing three per cent to the host communities in spite of the degradation and lack of development in the oil-producing areas.\u201d\n\nImmediate past Chairman of the Ondo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (OSOPADEC), Mr. Gbenga Edema, described the three per cent as unfair.\n\n\u201cThey have given about 30 per cent to NNPC for oil exploration in the North, which is another venture nobody is sure of returns. So, the three per cent is inadequate,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A United States District Court in Maryland has ordered the founder of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Dr Daniel Olukoya, to pay $7,320 within 30 days as part of sanctions in the suit he entered against human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, alleging defamatory publications.\n\nThe court, in a ruling by US Magistrate Judge, Timothy Sullivan, and obtained by SaharaReporters, titled, \u201cDKT 75 Order re \u2013 Motion for Sanctions 18-cv-02922,\u201d added that Olukoya was also \u201cprohibited from (1) making any use of any documents related to the U.K. Charity Commission that he produced to the Defendants after January 2, 2021; and from (2) challenging the admissibility of these documents on any basis.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had published stories involving Olukoya in September 2017 when some church members in Maryland accused him of importing religious books without paying customs duties.\n\nIt had been revealed that the church dragged some of its former pastors and members to court over monetary and property disputes.\n\nThe sued pastor and former church members had, in turn, accused the General Overseer of engaging in fraudulent activities in the US, including evasion of duties owed to US authorities.\n\nIn an action filed in the Circuit Court for Prince Georges\u2019 County of Maryland, U.S.A., (Case No. CAL16-26532) on behalf of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International, Lagos, and Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, USA, Nevada, the church had sought declaratory judgment and damages against Pastors Lawrence Adetunji, Ronke Adetunji, and 11 former members of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Bowie, Maryland. See Also Corruption Mountain Of Fire Ministries General Overseer, Olukoya, Threatens SaharaReporters With Fresh Lawsuits In Attempt To Stop Further Reports On UK Charity Commission Scandal\n\nAlso joined in the suit had been the Christ the Truth Ministry, the successor of MFM Bowie.\n\nAt issue are real property described as 5506 and 5503 Church Road in Bowie, Maryland, which were acquired by MFM Bowie in 2001 and 2004, respectively. Also in contention are funds for the MFM building in Bowie.\n\nIn October 2018, Olukoya and the church had instituted a court action at the US District Court for the District of Maryland against Sowore and Sahara Reporters Media Inc. in a suitcase number, 8:18-cv-02922, which Judge Theodore D. Chuang then heard. See Also Exclusive How United Kingdom Commission Appointed Interim Manager For Mountain Of Fire And Miracles Ministries Over Fraud Case\n\nHighlighting the Sahara Reporters publication of September 27, 2017, entitled \u201cFormer Mountain Of Fire Miracles Ministries Pastors Accuse General Overseer, Olukoya, Of Illegal Importation Of Goods In US Property Dispute,\u201d Olukoya and the church lawyers had stated in its 49-paragraph complaint their three causes of action which were; \u201cdefamation, defamation per se and false light.\u201d\n\nThey, therefore, claimed an award against all defendants to compensate for all economic damages sustained as a result of their tortious conduct; an award against all defendants to compensate for all presumed actual reputational damage; an award against all defendants to compensate for all presumed actual damages resulting from mental anguish and emotional distress; an award against all defendants of punitive damages; attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\n\nSaharaReporters had, nonetheless, in August 2020 also reported that Olukoya was considering taking another legal action against the online news publication to stop it from reporting about the United Kingdom Charity Commission scandal involving his church.\n\nOlukoya, in a letter written by his lawyer, Ime Nya Asanga, had alleged that SaharaReporters levelled false allegations against him and the MFM board of trustees.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported how the UK Charity Commission appointed an interim manager for the MFM in August 2019.\n\nThe commission, in a statement, said the interim manager assumes these duties at the exclusion of the charity\u2019s trustees, stating that the trustees retain control over matters relating to religious activities.\n\nThe UK charity regulator claimed it had serious concerns over MFM Chair of Trustees, Dr Daniel Olukoya, and his handling of serious incidents.\n\nIt accused Olukoya of illegally meeting a former employee of the charity alleged to have stolen between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3190,000 of the charity\u2019s funds in Nigeria, then entered into an agreement with the individual without consulting with other trustees.\n\nOlukoya had in the past filed three libel suits against the Publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, in Nigeria and another one before the District Court of Maryland, United States.\n\nWhile all the cases in Nigeria had been dismissed, the one in the US was decided only on June 24, 2021.\n\nWhile ruling on the suit, the US District Court magistrate said Olukoya should pay $7,320 within 30 days as part of sanctions in the suit he entered against Sowore while alleging defamatory publications.\n\nThe magistrate said, \u201cPlaintiff Daniel Olukoya brought this lawsuit against the Defendants to recover for purported defamatory statements that the Defendants made about him and his church in an article published on September 27, 2017.2 See ECF No. 73. During discovery, the Defendants sought information related to the U.K. Charity Commission\u2019s investigation of Olukoya\u2019s church. ECF No. 72 at 1-2. When Olukoya failed to provide the requested discovery, the Defendants filed a motion to compel (ECF No. 55). Among the discovery requests at issue was a request for \u201c[a]ll documents relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission related to Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International.\u201d ECF No. 55-3 at 13.\n\n\u201cIn response to the motion to compel, Olukoya stated that he had responded to the discovery requests and that the motion to compel was therefore moot. ECF No. 59. Thereafter, the court held a telephone conference to address a related dispute (whether Olukoya would be required to produce discovery responses directed to a party whose claims had been dismissed), but otherwise treated the Defendants\u2019 motion to compel as moot.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Olukoya\u2019s response to the motion to compel contained a serious misrepresentation; he had not produced any \u201cdocuments relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission related to Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International.\u201d See ECF No. 68 at 5 (noting that Olukoya produced no documents responsive to this request). And at 1 Judge Chuang referred this case to me for all discovery and related scheduling matters. ECF No. 57. 2 Other claims that Olukoya brought against the Defendants have been dismissed. ECF No. 26. Olukoya\u2019s deposition, which was held on April 23, 2021, Olukoya testified that there were \u201ctons and tons of documents in [his] possession\u201d that relate to the inquiry by the U.K. Charity Commission. ECF No. 72-8 at 34.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate added that the defendants, therefore, sought sanctions against Olukoya for his failure to produce the requested documents relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission.\n\nThe magistrate said, \u201cThe conclusion is that; for the reasons set forth above, the Defendants\u2019 Motion for Sanctions will be granted in part and denied in part. The court will enter the following sanctions against the Defendants: Olukoya is prohibited from (1) making any use of any documents related to the U.K. Charity Commission that he produced to the Defendants after January 2, 2021; and from (2) challenging the admissibility of these documents on any basis other than Fed. R. Evid. 401 and 403.\n\n\u201cOlukoya will also be required to pay the Defendants\u2019 reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with his discovery failures, which total $7,320.00, within 30 days of the date of this Order. Payment should be made directly to the Defendants\u2019 attorneys. These sanctions are entered against Olukoya pursuant to Rules 37(c) and 26(g).\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the response of Olukoya\u2019s legal team to the court, it already admitted that the said online publications did not lead to any harm for the church.\n\nThe court papers obtained by SaharaReporters said, \u201cDefendant Omoyele Sowore\u2019s Request for Admissions. Responses 1. Admit that Plaintiff Daniel Olukoya did not suffer any economic harm due to the publication of the Challenged Statements. RESPONSE: Plaintiff denies this request. 2.

          "text": "Jeff Bezos, American business magnate, who is founder and chief executive officer of one of the world\u2019s largest technological organisations Amazon, steps down from Amazon on Monday - exactly 27 years after he founded it.\n\nHowever, Bezos will retain a crucial role as the executive chair of the organisation. He will not be a part of the daily management and will spend more time on other projects including his Aerospace company Blue Origin.\n\nWithin the period, Bezos was CEO, he developed a series of unusual leadership principles - which some argue are the backbone of his success.\n\nThe chief of Amazon Web Services, Andy Jassy, will become the new CEO.\n\nAmazon Web Services, the astoundingly successful cloud computing service, didn't really have much to do with Amazon's core business: e-commerce.\n\nBut Bezos supported the idea, giving his trusted employee Andy Jassy the freedom, and capital, to go about creating a company within a company.\n\nBezos views Jassy as an entrepreneur, not just a manager - a key part of why he will take over as Bezos' successor.\n\nAmazon employees testify to Bezos' customer obsession. For Bezos, profit was a long-term aspiration. For a company to be successful, it had to have happy customers - at almost any cost.\n\nOne of Amazon senior managers, Nadia Shouraboura who started working for Amazon in 2004 told BBC that when she first started, she thought she was going to be immediately fired.\n\n\"I made the biggest mistake of my life during our Christmas peak,\" she said.\n\nShouraboura said she had ordered key products onto warehouse shelves that were too high. It would take time and money to get the right products off the shelves.\n\n\"I came up with a clever way for us to lose as little money as possible, and sort of fix the problem. But when I talked to Jeff about it he looked at me and said, 'you're thinking about this all wrong'.\n\n\"You're thinking how to optimise money here. Fix the problem for customers, and then come back to me in a few weeks and tell me the cost.\"\n\nBezos, however, has many critics. Last month, an article from ProPublica claimed to have seen Bezos' tax returns alleging he paid no tax in 2007 and 2011. It was a stunning claim about the world's richest man.\n\nThere have been other negative stories about Amazon, its ruthlessness, its claims of monopolistic behaviour that have been a dent on Bezos reputation.\n\nHowever, many people who worked closely with him have described him as a business visionary - a man with a singular focus who has created a legendary work philosophy and a company worth almost $1.8 trillion.\n\nAlways fascinated by space travel, later this month he aims to fly into space on the first crewed flight made by his company Blue Origin.",

          "title": "'You pay for pen, drinks' -- Couples recount tales of extortion, bribery at Ikoyi registry",
          "text": "Some couples who got married at the federal marriage registry, Ikoyi, Lagos state, have recounted their experiences with officials who extort and force them to pay bribes while applying for statutory licences and during the weddings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn investigation published by TheCable had exposed how corrupt officials of Ikoyi marriage registry, often touted as Nigeria\u2019s most patronised registry, charge prospective couples above the official application fee and divert millions of naira into their personal bank accounts.\n\nAfter the publication of the story, more applicants spoke to TheCable on how they were exploited by officials of the registry and made to part with more money after their certificates were withheld. Some took to social media to express their displeasure over the systemic corruption at the federal agency.\n\nFunmi, an applicant who got married just weeks ago at Ikoyi, said she paid N45,000 into the personal accounts of one of the officials for a special marriage application. Then, she paid another N60,000 for a change of venue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2020, the federal government reduced marriage registration fees and implementation began on July 1, 2020. A statutory ordinary marriage, which is between two Nigerians was reduced from N21,000 to N15,000, while the statutory special marriage, which happens when one partner is non-Nigerian, was reduced from N35,000 to N25,000.\n\n\u201cWe had to pay N45,000 because it was a special marriage since I have dual citizenship, then we wanted a private ceremony which is basically a change of venue. We had to pay an additional N60,000 for that into the personal account of one of the workers even though it states on the price list it\u2019s N30,000\u201d Funmi told TheCable.\n\n\u201cWe then had to pay for the registrar\u2019s Uber fees from the registry to the place of ceremony and from the place of the ceremony back to her house. My husband and I do not live in Nigeria and we would have to come do oath swearing, etc. We had a short period of time in Nigeria and this was termed \u2018fast track\u2019. I think we were also exploited because they knew we didn\u2019t live in Nigeria and that automatically translates to money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August, Mayowa Agunsoye was asked to pay N37,000 by an official of Ikoyi registry to \u201cfast track\u201d the process, but he was able to bargain well and eventually paid N27,000. While sharing his experience with TheCable, he said he had to return to Ikoyi after paying N21,000 to apply for a marriage certificate at a local government registry in the Oniru area of the state and was told that a licence from the LGA will not be recognised by embassies and international organisations.\n\n\u201cIkoyi refused to accept my Oniru registration and I was asked to start over,\u201d Agunsoye said.\n\n\u201cAt Ikoyi, you pay for biro, buy drinks for them, pay the joiner, two ladies on a seat at the entrance writing names of couples and assigning their names to a ghost syndicate, exorbitant dress rentals, the parking guys along the road with LASTMA. A colleague of mine, Afolabi Kuforiji, spent even far more than I did.\u201d\n\nTo corroborate his colleague\u2019s statement, Kuforiji said: \u201cThe worst part was when I was told to pay N3,500 at a particular time. I asked what it was for but they said it\u2019s Saturday morning. I couldn\u2019t negotiate, had to tell my wife to get a POS merchant across the road until the money was completed. And so many other unwanted expenses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a Twitter chat with Oby, who also got married at the Ikoyi registry on May 20, she said she received a receipt of N15,000 after paying a registration fee of N29,500. She said as of 10 am that she was married and leaving the venue, she heard officials calling on the couple on number 98 in the list.\n\n\u201cMrs Ade (Ikoyi official) told him (her husband) to pay N29,500, he didn\u2019t negotiate because his cousin had his in April and that was what they paid. There was no receipt issued or given. It was when I insisted because I know the government-approved price and knew he was extorted, the woman gave him a printout boldly written N15,000,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAfter we were joined, the lady asked for offering and we put together N1500 (my witnesses and couple); she said it\u2019s too small. She seized our certificate and asked us to go and bring money, while whispering in my ear \u2018your husband bu aka gum\u2019 meaning your husband is stingy in Igbo. We made use of POS and gave her N2,000 naira including the N1,500, so that\u2019s N3,500 in total. She repeated it, \u2018your husband bu aka gum\u2019.\u201d\n\nTobiloba Kanmi wrote: \u201cWhat baffles me is getting there at 6 am and I was given number 105.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat baffles me is getting there at 6am and i was given number 105 \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \u2014 LOL\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39 LITTLE OF LAGOS (@tobilobalokanmi) July 3, 2021\n\nMelon usk wrote: \u201cBought 2 pens each at 200 naira per pen or so.

The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive into the story. Entertaining Africans With the Twitter ban still waxing strong in Nigeria, popular skit makers like Oli Ekun, Koye \u201cK10\u201d and Switope (aka queen of impressions) are not losing their steam. These three are part of a new crop of talented comedians who have envious social wealth and are adding incredible value to Nigeria\u2019s creator economy.\n\nBeyond providing African creators with the tools they need to entertain their fans, video-sharing and creating platforms also connect influential creators to local and international brands who are willing to spend big bucks on customer acquisition and retention. Who else is impressed by the rise of Elsa Majimbo\u2019s success story? The well-loved Kenyan comedienne, who rose to fame after posting satirical monologues on Twitter, has hung out with Naomi Campbell, collaborated with Valentino, and posed on the cover of GQ South Africa. Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nIf you are African then you know how opposed African parents are to their children studying anything but science subjects. But the 2020 pandemic opened the floodgates of creative juices and it looks like gifted creators are finally getting the respect they deserve. Widening the creator\u2019s pool I first discovered Cameo after Feyikemi Abudu posted a video of Amir Arison (The Blacklist) shouting her out on camera. With Cameo anyone can hire a celebrity actor, athlete or musician to make a personalized shout-out video. Cameo gives its celebrity users the freedom to decline video requests that don\u2019t suit their tastes. While Cameo has a database of celebrities from mostly the US and Europe, the app hasn\u2019t onboarded any African celebrities. Imagine being able to pay Burna Boy or Yemi Alade to make a shout-out video for you or a loved one? In 2016, IrokoTV launched IrokoX \u2013 an online network designed to help indie (independent) creators hack monetisation and distribution. The platform has since gone quiet and all that is left is a paper trail of online press releases. But all hope isn\u2019t lost yet. Last week, Minly \u2013 an Egypt-based creator platform \u2013 announced that they raised $3.6 million in a seed round to enable stars in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) to create personalized videos for their fans. Like most startups with an eye for the creator economy, Minly launched late last year during the thick of the COVID pandemic. Since their entrance into the digital ecosystem, Minly has onboard over 50,000 users and have an impressive list of regional celebrities on their platforms. Now the question on my mind is: Will Minly expand to other countries on the continent or will we see African entrepreneurs build creator platforms to cater to their home country\u2019s entertainment needs? FROM THE CABAL TeamApt closes an undisclosed amount in its recently announced Series B round. According to the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Tosin Eniolorunda, they have their eyes set on Francophone Africa.

          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "FairMoney, like many other Nigerian fintechs, started out in the lending business and is about completing its evolution into being a full-fledged digital bank.\n\nToday it announced a $42 million Series B round. It was led by Tiger Global Management with existing investors like DST Partners, Flourish Ventures, Newfund, and Speedinvest participating.\n\nThe investment comes after FairMoney raised $11 million Series A two years ago and $16 million in total within its first four years.\n\nFor Tiger Global which led the round, this is its fourth investment in an African startup after iRoko (2013), Takealot (2014) and Flutterwave (2021). Notably, this is the first time the investment firm is investing in two African startups within a year. A sign of its renewed interest in the African continent after a long hiatus.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with FairMoney as they build a better financial hub for customers in Nigeria and India,\u201d Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement. \u201cWe were impressed by the team and the strong growth to date and look forward to supporting FairMoney as they continue to scale.\u201d\n\nFairMoney\u2019s Performance\n\nFounded in 2017 by Laurin Hainy, Matthieu Gendreau, and Nicolas Berthozat, FairMoney started its operations in Nigeria before expanding to India last year.\n\nFrom having a little over 100,000 users in its first year of operation, FairMoney has grown to have 1.3 million unique users who have made more than 6.5 million loan applications. Last year, the company disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million.\n\nWithin the short time its being in India, the company has processed more than 500,000 loan applications from over 100,000 unique users.\n\nThis year, FairMoney achieved one of its crucial goals by acquiring a microfinance bank license in Nigeria. The license allows FairMoney to operate as a financial service provider in Nigeria.\n\nLooking forward\n\nComing off a fantastic 2020, the company says it is projecting to disburse $300 million worth of loans this year. It\u2019ll finance this by raising bonds.\n\nFairMoney has come a long way since it started as a credit provider, it\u2019s ambition according to co-founder Laurin Hainy is that \u201cby the end of the year, its customers will have a full-fledged banking experience from P2P transfers and lending to debit cards and current accounts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also working on a number of additional services including savings, stock trading, and crypto-trading products. These are subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nWith this new funding, rather than expanding into other countries, FairMoney wants to focus and consolidate its position in Nigeria and India. While it\u2019s not expanding further geographically, its talent pool is, with about 150 open positions.\n\nFairMoney is not alone in its ambitions to dominate the Neobank scene in Nigeria, Kuda in March raised $25 million.\n\nWith more players coming onto the Neobank scene in Nigeria, one might get a feel that it\u2019s a space that\u2019s getting crowded but the fact that about 56% of Nigerian adults are unbanked hints that there\u2019s room for many to play in this space.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Faith Keza is leading Irembo to fully digitise Rwanda",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were living in Rwanda today and needed to get a government-issued certificate, you can simply fill out some forms and make your payment \u2013 all online. Your certificate will be sent to your inbox when ready.\n\nIrembo is leading this digitisation of services in Rwanda. And steering the Irembo ship is Faith Keza.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 pm in Lagos when we sit to talk over Google Meet. Due to scheduling conflicts, our conversation had been delayed for some weeks but I was excited to be speaking with her.\n\nAfter getting her degree from MIT, she worked at Oracle, Delphix, Google and is now the CEO of Irembo. Faith is also on the board of the Rwanda National Bank and the Rwanda Development Board.\n\nSo how is she able to do all this? In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor two children to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top students in the country and in the end, Faith Keza and another student were on their way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking. In 2018 and 2019, she was nominated to be on the boards of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).\n\nOn these boards, she does a lot of things including consulting on the state of tech in the country and how the country can work towards their digital goals.\n\nBased on her hobbies, it\u2019s likely that Faith is looking forward to spending more time reading, making recipes from the internet, or watching Netflix \u2013 after they put out some new shows because she insists she has watched all the good ones.\n\nAnd now, as CEO of Irembo, the goal is to expand. With the largest growing youth population in the world, a digitised Africa will be a sight to behold.\n\nWith Faith Keza, Irembo could be at the front of that movement.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "6 ways to convert your Instagram followers into paying customers",
          "text": "This post is a delayed version of SME Clinic newsletter, a weekly newsletter that provides tips and recommendations to help you position your small business for success. Register to attend SME Clinic 2021 here.\n\nFor the most part, people sign up for Instagram to connect with friends and enjoy content while simultaneously growing their followers and improving engagements.\n\nHowever, as a business owner, your focus should be on turning these followers into clients \u2014 people who pay for your products and services.\n\nIf only a handful of your Instagram followers have ever patronised your business, or you do not even know how to start advertising on the platform, here are a few ways to convert your followers into paying, repeat customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Have a clear idea of your target audience\n\nOften, it\u2019s so easy to think that your products/services are solutions to all problems. But that\u2019s not true. As a business owner, you\u2019re not for everybody.\n\nYour product/service has a specific problem it\u2019s proffering solutions to. Find out what problems your followers have that can be solved with your product/service.\n\n2. Post persistently, but more importantly strategically\n\nIf nobody knows what you\u2019re selling, you won\u2019t get buyers. Be loud about what you do! Own your brand and promote it relentlessly and strategically.\n\nCreate content around your product/service offering and share consistently. Pick specific days in the week that you post, and let the content always emphasise what you\u2019re offering and what makes it unique.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to take a break, but communicate with your followers beforehand.\n\n3. Engage your audience regularly\n\nThis cannot be overemphasised. Building a good relationship with your followers is very important. It\u2019s as easy as constantly leaving kind and witty comments on their posts, sending them wishes on their birthdays etc.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, it\u2019s important to go first! You could personalise it and go a step further to send DMs, know what they care about, and engage their interests as observed from their posts. This will create a leeway to introduce your products/services. Outstanding customer relationships are key.\n\n4. Customer feedback is a pot of gold\n\nSo, you\u2019ve completed an order for one or two followers; don\u2019t let it end there. Ask for feedback. What was their experience like using your products? What did they wish was better? Without the interactions, it\u2019s not social; it\u2019s just media!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd share this feedback. Let your service do the talking. Word of mouth is a fast selling medium. There are products you\u2019ve used today because you know someone who knows someone that knows someone.\n\n5. Invest in paid advertisement\n\nPaid advertisement prices on Instagram depend on what package you and for how long you want the ads to run.\n\nBut even when you do this, you still have to engage with your customers to keep them. Reply DMs; it shows trust. Research shows that the longest a customer on social media is willing to wait for a reply is 4 hours. After this, they might no longer trust you.\n\n6. Give often\n\nGiving in a world that keeps taking is rare, and this is good for a change.\n\nPick a time \u2014 maybe once or twice a month \u2014 when you let your followers apply for a giveaway. This helps to get and publicly share feedback on your product/service.\n\nIt\u2019s never been easier to promote oneself and build in public; however, it\u2019s never been so easy to be open to the unexpected. But at the end of the day, a great deal of the shots we miss are the ones we don\u2019t take!\n\nJoin us at SME Clinic 2021 to learn more about how to market and grow your business online.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Early Bird Offer!

          "text": "Good day,\n\nIn April 2019, South Korea claimed to be the first country to deploy 5G commercially, an hour ahead of the US. At the end of May 2021, it had 15.84 million 5G subscriptions, 22% of its 71.45 million mobile subscribers. The highest penetration numbers of any country.\n\nApart from this, According to Statista, South Korea\u2019s Jeonju is the city with the fastest Internet downloads speed in the world at 415.6 Mbps.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not been a bed of roses. The country still suffers from spotty connection, limited availability \u2014 only in urban areas \u2014 and poor network quality. Recently, South Korea\u2019s three main cellular networks \u2014 SK Telecom, KT Corporation, and LG UPlus \u2014 were sued by more than 500 5G subscribers for disappointing service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this concern you? In the last few months, there\u2019s been a lot of 5G news flying about. Kenya became the second African country to deploy the technology commercially. Nigeria announced the signing of an MOU on using the C-band Spectrum for its deployment while also creating a committee to hash out the terms of the auction for the Spectrum licence.\n\nLast week, MTN Uganda signed a partnership with Telecom Infra Project (TIP), an engineering-focused community, to automate its network preparation for 5G technology. With such impressive numbers, there might be a few lessons to learn from the Asian country.\n\nWhat can Africa learn from South Korea? A recent report by Speedcheck notes that a major contributing factor to the country\u2019s 5G success is its early usage of the C-band Spectrum, a mid-range frequency set at 3.6 GHz-4.2 GHz.\n\nIt is often touted as the best frequency for the deployment of 5G services because it balances the disparity found in other frequencies. It allows for wider area coverage than high-range frequencies while also giving better quality connection than low-range frequencies.\n\nOf the two countries in Africa where 5G has been commercially deployed, none have held auctions for a C-band Spectrum licence. South Africa halted sales while Kenya has been relatively quiet on its adoption.\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria is making plans to conduct an auction before deployment. Would this prove helpful eventually? South Korea\u2019s experience says yes.\n\nOther factors include easy access to 5G enabled devices, aggressive rollout strategies like subsidies and vigorous marketing \u2014 which has had some adverse effects like the lawsuit I mentioned earlier \u2014 and recently allowing independent mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to offer cheaper data plans dissociated from mobile network operators (MNOs).\n\nThe 5G network promises faster download speeds and connectivity and access to augmented reality and autonomous driving. South Koreans already enjoy these, although not as well as advertised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Africa\u2019s Internet speed barely hitting the 10% mark of South Korea\u2019s, even with 5G deployment in some cities, maybe we might have to take a closer look at the Asian country\u2019s strategy.\n\nSpeaking of Internet speed, MainOne has set up another data centre in Appolonia City, Accra, Ghana, to expand its digital footprints in West Africa.\n\nA data centre is a facility that an organisation uses to store, process, and disseminate data and applications. MainOne\u2019s MDXi data centre is a commercial service which it offers to its clients. It currently operates in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nWhat does this mean for Ghanians? According to the company, it would mean faster internet connections and direct access to content providers.\n\nIn the spirit of our earlier conversation, I did some digging and found that 5G might require data centres to restructure their systems to handle data processed from technology like autonomous driving, smart grids, and online gaming. Read more here: How 5G will affect the structure of data centers\n\nEmmanuel\u2019s article on MainOne\u2019s launch would give you more insight. Don\u2019t forget to check in later today.\n\nMeanwhile, let\u2019s take a quick detour to Nigeria and have a short chat about its Electoral Act, more specifically, electronic transmission of results.\n\nPer Punch, the National Assembly is set to receive and debate the provisions of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill on Tuesday, July 6, 2021. But there may be trouble brewing. A provision regarding electronic transmission of results \u2014 the subject of great discourse in preceding months \u2014 might have been removed.\n\nMembers of the House intend to oppose removing the provision which former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ikweremadu, told Channels Television had been in the works for some time.\n\nI\u2019ll be keeping my eyes peeled for more news on this.\n\nWhat you missed on Techpoint last week\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nGoogle Chrome will actively direct you away from insecure websites. Read\n\nDid you hear of the fire that engulfed the Gulf of Mexico? If you didn\u2019t, here\u2019s a video. Also, here\u2019s why The Ocean Caught Fire In The Gulf of Mexico\n\n3 guiding principles for CEOs who post on Twitter. Read\n\nHave an awesome week!",

          "text": "Kenyan eCommerce startup, Copia Global, has announced the expansion of its services to Uganda. Having established its presence in the Kenyan market, where it claims to serve over one million customers, the startup has its sights on Uganda\u2019s growing middle class.\n\nCopia Global operates a different model from most eCommerce platforms. Rather than depending on a website, it uses a network of agents spread across the country. When customers need an item, they visit an agent with a digital device to place their order.\n\nAfter placing their order, the agent sends it to Copia Global, who processes and delivers it within two days when the customer returns to pick it up. By adopting this model, the company can serve people who do not own digital devices or cannot access the Internet. Interestingly, it does all this using USSD technology.\n\nWhile the startup has a website, it is mainly for customers who live in urban areas. This way, they can order goods and have them delivered to people living in rural communities where Copia Global has agents.\n\nThis model is perfect for Uganda, where despite 47% of the population owning mobile subscriptions, only 12 million Ugandans use the Internet. However, its combination of an online and offline model is not exactly novel. In 2019, eCommerce giant, Jumia, partnered with Vivo Energy to use its service stations as pick-up and drop-off points for customers.\n\nAccording to Founder and Chairman, Tracey Turner, \u201cUganda has one of the fastest-growing middle classes in the world with a hardworking population and a dynamic entrepreneurial culture. Copia is designed specifically to serve this high growth but underserved consumer base who want access to high-quality products at the best prices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, the startup has raised $53 million in funding from investors, including LGT Lightstone, Endeavor Catalyst, and Goodwell Investments.\n\neCommerce startups in Africa have primarily struggled to show a viable market for their services, with Konga sold in 2018 and Jumia\u2019s business struggling despite listing on the New York Stock Exchange. While models like Copia Global\u2019s that seek to serve low-income consumers might seem like the way to go, eCommerce startups need to serve a larger market to make as much revenue as the giants do.",

          "title": "How local cereal makers are slicing into N200bn baby food market",
          "text": "The rising cost of branded baby cereals in Nigeria, where seven million babies are born yearly, has prompted the increasing production of an innovative local variant that is cheaper and said to contain the essential nutrients children need to grow, writes GBEMI FAMINU.\n\nOlaifa Memunat is a 25-year-old who recently gave birth to twin boys, in Alagbado area of Lagos state. As a full-time housewife with four children below the age of six, the family survives on N25,000 ($50) every month which is the husband\u2019s steady monthly income as a security guard at a factory.\n\nDespite the family\u2019s meagre income, the healthy-looking two-month-old babies weigh 4.5 and 4.2 kilogram respectively. Memunat says the boys eat voraciously and cannot be sustained with milk alone hence, she feeds them with a locally made cereal known as \u2018Tom Brown\u2019.\n\nThe local cereal is a thick brown powder made from a combination of cereals such as yellow maize, soybean, millet, guinea corn. Also added are crayfish, pepper, kuli-kuli (a local snack made from groundnut), dry fish, and actual groundnut etc. all of which are roasted and dry blended.\n\nIt is prepared by being dissolved or made into a paste using room temperature water after which it is stirred continuously on fire until it thickens; it is then ready to eat as a puree.\n\nRead Also: Grand Cereals announces Bode Emmanuel\u2019s retirement as board chairman\n\nSome mothers add milk as well as blended fruits and nuts in powdered form to the mix, to add more flavour and increase the nutrients it provides.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), every year, at least 7 million babies are born in Nigeria, accelerating population growth, which is estimated to be the fifth largest in the world at 401 million by 2050. However, the growing population is occurring in a parallel with a 40.1 percent poverty rate, 33 percent unemployment rate, and a double-digit inflation rate of 17.93 percent as at May 2021.\n\nTo survive and feed their babies, many parents with low purchasing power and constrained income resort to using the locally made cereal, which costs between N300 (60 cents) and N5000 ($10) depending on size, the least being 16grams.\n\nThis is a cheaper alternative to the branded cereals, which cost between N2, 500 ($5) to N9, 000 ($18) depending on the size and brand.\n\nWith the high rate of malnutrition in Nigeria and Africa generally, the cereal addresses possible nutritional deficiencies, which can hinder a baby\u2019s growth and development process. According to UNICEF, just 18 percent of children aged 6-23 months are fed the minimum acceptable diet in Nigeria, with the country having the second-highest burden of stunted children in the world, with a national prevalence rate of 32 percent of children under five.\n\nThe local cereal, according to nursing mothers and childcare experts who spoke with BusinessDay, nourishes babies with diverse vitamins and minerals that aid their growth.\n\nKen Research in its Nigeria Baby Food Market Outlook, the shift towards organic baby food is observed on the back of increasing health awareness and purchasing power of households, which has encouraged the demand for flavoured baby foods and other variants. The baby food industry, generally, is projected to reach N200 billion by 2023.\n\nAccording to Paediatric experts, the nutritional benefits of the cereals used to formulate this local alternative include but are not limited to protein, iron, magnesium, potassium, carbohydrate, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, etc.\n\nIn Nigeria, there are several producers of this baby cereal looking to tap the market potentials. One of them is Yemisi Akeju, CEO, Fawree Foods who makes and sells the Tom Brown cereal in Lagos.\n\nWhile babies are sometimes known to reject formulated food, she says rejection of this local cereal is less than 10 percent. This makes it an attractive solution for parents with picky eaters, adding that if stored in an air-tight container it has a shelf life of one year.\n\nShe retails the cereal in a 1kg jar sold for N2,200 and supplies a minimum of five packs monthly to supermarkets with each pack containing 12 jars. From this, she makes about N132, 000 monthly.\n\nRead Also: In 10 numbers, how Nigeria\u2019s biggest companies have fared in 2020\n\nApart from being recommended by some medical personnel, Akeju says her production and sale of the cereal is approved by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), after going through some processes and fulfilling certain requirements.\n\nShe added that the cereal is made from products like millet, soya beans, maize, etc. however due to some allergic reactions, crayfish as one of the ingredients was replaced with unripe plantain.\n\nKemi Omoloye also makes and sells the local cereal on a micro-scale. She spends between N2500 and N3000 to make it depending on the size and inputs, she then sells the 5kg size for N6000 and N8000 in some cases depending on the special request for some ingredients like dried nuts, dates, cocoa powder, or coconut flour to give different flavours and acting as sweeteners to avoid the use of sugar.\n\nHaving been in the business for five years, Omoloye says it has gotten better over time as she makes an average profit of N3000 on each 5kg sold, selling a minimum of six every week and 25 monthly. To make a 5kg Tom Brown cereal, she uses 850grams of yellow corn, soybean, and guinea corn, 650grams of millet, 200 grams of groundnut and crayfish, for special requests she adds cocoa powder, unripe plantain, coconut flour, etc.\n\n\u201cProducing the cereal requires proper measurement to avoid side effects from too much fibre or too much carbohydrate which is not good for babies,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition, if an allergic reaction is noticed it is refined continually till the right and most suitable mixture is achieved, it also requires a high level of hygiene.\u201d\n\nWhen some of the ingredients are scarce or become expensive, the cost of the cereal increases and in very rare cases, Omoleye makes use of substitutes like guinea corn or white maize. Free from unhealthy preservatives, she says the cereal has a shelf life of nine months to one year when placed in an airtight container.\n\nWhile she acknowledges the product generally requires approval by necessary agencies such as NAFDAC, she is yet to register her brand because she says it is on a small scale and she may not be able to fulfil all the requirements.\n\nOladejo Tokunbo is mother to a six-month-old baby, and though the family has an income of N250,000 monthly from both parents, she also uses the alternative local baby food for her baby.\n\n\u201cMy baby is a voracious eater,\u201d she says. \u201cI initially fed her with baby cereal from a well-known brand which cost N2500 per 400grams. This lasted between two and three days and she was never filled.\u201d\n\nShe tried other baby food brands but the baby reacted adversely to them, making her spend about N20,000 on baby milk monthly. She however started using the local baby food when a colleague of hers recommended it.\n\nAlthough hesitant at first, Tokunbo is now a converted advocate of the local cereal as her baby enjoys it. She has also reduced the cost of baby food to N10,000 monthly. Hers is rather homemade too, with her mother helping to make it from scratch which reduces production cost while increasing the quantity and quality.\n\n\u201cMy baby\u2019s growth has improved tremendously with the local cereal, it is filling, organic and highly nutritious,\u201d she said.\n\nWunmi Falade retails the locally made cereal as well as other baby food products at the Elewe-omo section in the popular Oja-Oba market in Oshogbo, Osun state. She says that it is convenient for mothers to buy the smallest measuring cup, which sells for N300 while the 4kg goes for N3000. She also sells the ingredients for those who prefer to make it themselves.\n\n\u201cSome mothers also come together, make contributions and make a very large quantity which they share among themselves, it helps them to get more quantity cheaper,\u201d she revealed.\n\nFalade\u2019s customers are not just nursing mothers because, beyond feeding babies, adults also enjoy the cereal and some use it to make swallow meals.\n\nThe cereal is also popular in other parts of the country, for instance Imo, where Chidinma Harbor, who has an 18-month-old toddler, makes hers by sourcing inputs from the Relief Market located in Ikenegbu Extension Layout, Owerri.\n\nShe spends as low as N5,000 which will fill a 7kg bowl and sustains not just her baby but her family for a month and sometimes more. Sometimes she buys the pre-packaged 1kg for N1200, which was formerly sold for N900.\n\nHauwa Mohammed, a Kaduna-based nursing mother of a seven-month-old baby also makes her own version of the cereal, known in her local Hausa parlance as Kunu Tamba. She uses grains like finger millet, wheat, beans, guinea corn, groundnut, and rice.\n\nSourcing her ingredients from the Kasuwa market in Kaduna, she spends N5,000 to make 5kg worth which lasts six weeks.\n\nAs noted by Eva Osagie, a Lagos-based Nutritionist, what babies eat goes a long way in determining how well they can grow, hence the best options parents have are meals that can provide enough vitamins and nutrients.\n\n\u201cBabies and children need food for brain development, bone development, and lots of vitamins to build their immune system, the ingredients of the cereal fulfils all of that, hence a good and affordable option for mothers,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Durosola Modupe, chief nursing officer, Paediatric Unit, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) it is advised that the meal is introduced to babies from six months as a complimentary meal. However, it has to be hygienically sourced and prepared because babies have very low immune levels and can react to it badly.\n\nEfforts to ascertain NAFDAC\u2019s requirement on approval and registration of the cereal as a consumable product was futile, as Sayo Akintola, NAFDAC\u2019s resident media and communication consultant refused to reply.",

          "text": "Railway Project: Lagos to divert traffic at Brewery, Ijora from Sunday, July 4th\n\nThe Lagos State Government has announced the diversion of traffic flow at Brewery and Ijora Level Crossings for the railway modernisation project from Sunday, July 4 to August 1.\n\nThe construction is in line with the Nigerian railway modernisation project, Lagos-Ibadan section, with an extension to Lagos Port at Apapa.\n\nAccording to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), this is contained in a statement issued by the Lagos State commissioner for transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, on Friday, July 2, 2021, in Lagos.\n\nOladeinde revealed that the construction company, China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) Nigeria Ltd. would commence asphalt and drainage works on the first lane from July 4 to July 18 and then afterwards, proceed to the second lane from July 18 to August. 1.\n\nHe said, \u201ca counter flow will be created on the lane that is free when rehabilitation works are ongoing on the other to enable motorists to ply the route and reach their various destinations without much difficulty. We urge road users to comply with the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) to minimise inconveniences that may be experienced while the construction lasts.\u2019\u2019\n\nRead Also: Pulling down the railway tracks\n\nThe Lagos State government had recently temporarily closed some roads for construction work as part of the Nigerian Railway Modernisation project. Some of the roads earlier closed include those at Agege, Iganmu, Apapa dockyard, Ilupeju and so on.\n\nFG to fine passenger airlines $3,500 for not complying with new COVID-19 protocols from the coming week\n\nThe Federal Government is set to fine airlines the sum of $3,500 per passenger or ban them from flying in Nigeria if they fail to comply with its new COVID-19 pre-boarding requirements.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Chairman, Presidential Steering Committee, (PSC), Boss Mustapha, on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the pre-boarding requirements, according to PSC, is that incoming passengers must now perform a COVID-19, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test three days before boarding.\n\nMustapha said, \u201cThe test detects the presence of a virus if you are infected at the time of the test. The test could also detect fragments of the virus even after you are no longer infected. This is part of the new reviewed travel restrictions in the country. Passengers must perform a COVID-19 PCR test not more than three days (72 hours) before boarding. The PCR test done more than 72 hours before departure is not valid and the person will not be allowed to board. Rapid antigen or antibody tests are not acceptable; only PCR tests can be used for this purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cTest validity commences from the time of sample collection. For passengers with multiple connections before arrival in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, passengers must bring along an electronic or hard copy of their COVID-19 PCR test for presentation at the departure airport and upon arrival in Nigeria. The PSC chairman also said that foreigners without a PCR test would be deported.\n\n\u201cPassengers who are Nigerians or holders of a permanent residence permit will be allowed entry. However, passengers, who visited Turkey, Brazil, India, South Africa within 14 days, will be denied entry into Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Again, Emirates bans Nigeria flights, extends South Africa route suspension\n\nOPEC\u2019s last-minute brawl halts oil price rally while COVID-19 Delta variant supports gold prices\n\nThe black liquid hydrocarbon drifted slightly lower in London at the last trading session of the week after recent fundamentals reveal the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) are not all on the same table regarding output levels, amid surging global demand.\n\nOil prices fell 2% to a one-week low on Monday after hitting their highest since 2018, as a spike in COVID-19 cases in Asia and Europe put a break on the rally before OPEC+ Meeting.\n\nPrices on Wednesday extended the previous day\u2019s small gains after an industry report showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week, overriding trader and investor concerns about transportation curbs in some countries as COVID-19 cases surge. On Thursday, oil prices rose roughly 2% on indications that OPEC+ producers could increase output more slowly than expected in the coming months while rising global fuel demand causes supply to tighten.\n\nPrices inched lower on Friday after OPEC+ ministers delayed a meeting on output policy as the United Arab Emirates baulked at a plan to add back 2 million barrels per day (BPD) in the second half of the year. Brent had a weekly growth of 0.04%.\n\nGold appreciated by 0.17% while Silver also inched up by 1.27% W-o-W\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be mixed as OPEC+ seeks agreement on oil output policy after initial talks end in disarray. The spread of the Delta variant is likely to pare gains in the near term.\n\nGold prices are expected to be mixed in the coming week, as the dollar strengthens, and while the spread of the Delta variant is expected to support gold as it can delay economic recovery.\n\nCurrency Market\n\nThe currency market was bearish this week at the bureau de change (BDC) market while it appreciated slightly at the official window.\n\nIt depreciated against the US dollar by +1.01%, appreciated against the British Pound by -0.56% while it remained flat against the Euro on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis at the BDC window.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira appreciated week-on-week by +0.10% and +0.14% at the NAFEX window.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N411.25 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N410.42.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney Market\n\nMoney market rates continued their double-digits trend last week, however, on a W-o-W basis, both overnight rates and open buyback fell significantly.\n\nAt the close of the trading session last week, funding rates fell. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 12.00% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 12.50% indicating a W-o-W decline of -45.45% for OBB and -45.65% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to continue their double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury bills\n\nThe Treasury Bills Market started the previous week on a bullish note, with the average benchmark falling by 38bps. Although the bullish sentiment was not maintained throughout the week.\n\nAt the close of the market on Friday, average benchmark yields for T-bills fell by -4.71% to 6.58% while OMO bills rose marginally by +1.87% W-o-W to close at 9.92%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill fell by -2.46%.\n\nThe CBN sold N163.61 billion worth of notes against N81.72 billion offered at its NTB auction this week. The 91-day, 182-day & 364-day notes were allotted at 2.50%, 3.50%, & 9.15% respectively. Compared to the previous auction, rates on the 91-day & 182-day were unchanged while the 364-day paper fell slightly by 25bps.\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN and Euro bonds market\n\nThe Bond market opened in a relatively bullish trend at the start of the week as demand was seen across the board and continued for most of the trading session in the week.\n\nAt the close of the week, the overall market was bullish with buying interest seen across the board.\n\nThe overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.62% for the week which fell W-o-W by -2.17%.\n\nThe relatively weak trend in the Eurobond market persisted last week, as renewed covid-19 concerns coupled with the rising US inflation, continue to dampen demand across the board.\n\nRead Also: Nigerian states in more trouble as oil prices rise\n\nThe relatively weak trend in the Eurobond market persisted last week, as renewed covid-19 concerns coupled with the rising US inflation, continue to dampen demand across the board.\n\nWe expect market sentiment to remain soft as inflation concerns continue to linger.\n\nNigerian Capital Market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the previous week on a positive note inching up by +1.47%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange gained N292.39bn thus, year-to-date return moderated to -5.11%.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was significantly bullish last week as the NSE Consumer Goods was the highest gainer for the week with +5.15% while NSE-Oil and Gas recorded the highest decline with -1.05%. NSE-IND, NSE Pension, NSE-30 and, NSE Banking closed the week positive with +2.10%, +1.88%, +1.89%, and +1.34% respectively.\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of sustained bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of good bargains, however, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments are likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\nThe Nigeria economy in retrospect\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning disclosed on Thursday at the presentation of the draft for the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper that the Federal Government had spent 92.7 % of the prorated budget, which amounts to N4.8tn. Of which, N1.8tn an equivalent of 37.5%was released for debt servicing, while N1.5tn (31.25%) was spent on personnel cost, and N973.13bn (20.2%) was spent on capital projects. Also at the event, the minister disclosed that the government would spend up to N900bn on petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission have disclosed that it would soon commence the review of the allocation formula applicable to the revenue retained in the Federation Account.\n\nThe review would begin with the vertical sharing formula which shows the proportion of revenues allocated to the three tiers of government. This will be followed by the horizontal formula which addresses sharing among states and local governments. An official of the commission concluded that whatsoever the commission fixes are final and cannot be surpassed.\n\nAccording to data obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), banks\u2019 credit to Nigeria\u2019s private sector increased by +4% (N1.29 trillion) in Q1 2021 to reach N31.44 trillion in Q1 2021. This is coming on the back of the bank\u2019s continued effort to encourage lending to the real sector to stimulate Nigeria\u2019s economic growth. Meanwhile, credit advanced to the public sector reduced by N410.7 billion in the review period. A further breakdown of the figures reveals that while total credit to the economy rose by+2% (N880.65 billion) in Q1 2021, from N42.55 trillion as of December 2020 to N43.44 trillion at the end of Q1 2021. Meanwhile, credit allocation to the government declined by -3% (N410.62 billion) from N12.4 trillion to N11.99 trillion.\n\nThe federal government stated in the week that electricity subsidy has been reduced by N20bn per month. This is following record-high tariff collections of N65bn in the December 2020 cycle up from an average of N39bn).\n\nThe Minister of Power, however, stated that the Federal Government still paid over N50bn monthly to subsidise electricity supply in the country. You would recall that the International Monetary Fund had in its \u2018Resilience through reform\u2019 report expressed concern over the subsidies in Nigeria.\n\nGroup managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, disclosed on Tuesday that the price of petrol should be more than N280/litre which is the price of Automotive Gas Oil(diesel). PMS which unlike diesel is subsidized by the government currently sells for N162/litre. According to the NNPC Group Managing Director, AGO (diesel) should normally sell for above the price of PMS.\n\nThe National Pension Commission PenCom announced on Wednesday that the Federal Government has approved payment of outstanding accrued pension rights for verified and enrolled retirees of treasury-funded MDAs that retired but are yet to be paid their retirement benefits, as well as the backlog of death benefits claims due to beneficiaries of deceased employees of treasury funded MDAs.\n\nIn keeping with the Pensions Reform Act (2014), the Federal Government is required to contribute the payment of the 10% rate as an employer under a pension contribution for its employees, while the employees contribute 8%).\n\nOn Monday, the landing cost of Premium Motor Spirit being imported into Nigeria surged by more than 60 percent between December 2020 and mid-June this year. From an average of N143.60 per litre in December, the landing cost of petrol rose to N231.98 per litre on June 16 this year on the back of the rally in global oil prices and the depreciation of the naira against the dollar.\n\nOn Tuesday, the price of Automotive Gas Oil, also known as diesel, jumped to N280 per litre amid the recent increase in global prices and naira devaluation.\n\nThe Senate on Thursday passed the Petroleum Industry Bill and approved that three percent of the profit made by oil firms should be shared to host communities. The Senate also approved that 30 percent of profits accruing from oil and gas operations by the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation would be set aside for exploration of oil in the frontier basin.\n\nFiscal authorities have, despite dwindling earnings, maintained an aggressive posture. The government is making disbursements under the Special Public Works Programme and has recently announced its plan to expend $1bn on the construction of 3 major highways in the country, all to reflate the economy.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at 33%, analysts are concerned about whether or not jobs would be growth elastic, especially as job creation is the medium through which growth impacts households and individuals. Similarly, there are concerns about the discounting effect associated inflation could have on purchasing power.\n\nOn the monetary side, the CBN in collaboration with RIFAN recently sought to reduce the food price level by supplying 27,000 metric tons of paddy rice to millers across the country. There have been fears that food prices were, in the month, on the rise with increases recorded in the prices of staples, spices, and condiments. The MPC would consider the next inflation figures for June 2021 to determine whether MPR should be raised when it meets in July.\n\nIn the external sector, we have continued to see net imports rise as well as a reduction in government earnings amidst OPEC production cuts. This critically constrains CBN\u2019s capacity to defend the Naira against the Dollar in the long term.\n\nOn the global scene, stimulus packages have continued to boost recovery although the Delta variant of the COVID-19 infection has now been reported in 85 countries. Full economic recovery, therefore, depends on whether the positive sentiments and improved consumer confidence earlier seen are sustained.",

Greg Ogbeifun, who spoke at an engagement session with stakeholders in Benin City, said the port is a legacy project of the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration, designed to key into the federal government\u2019s initiative of diversifying the economy away from oil, into agriculture and agro-allied business.\n\nOgbeifun, who disclosed that the governor has approved the engagement of CPCS Transaction, a consortium of specialist firms from Canada, Belgium and Nigeria, for the provision of Transaction Advisory Services on the project, said the project is to be developed through Public-Private Partnership (PPP).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis legacy project is of historical and economic significance to the focal communities, the people of Edo State, and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cApart from the generation of massive employment opportunities during the construction and operational phases, it is expected that this port would also position Nigeria to benefit from facilities of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), under which investment in agriculture is a major consideration.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the need for the development of a port in Edo State dates back to the pre-colonial era when the Portuguese accessed the Benin Kingdom through Benin River and Osse River for trade purposes, which culminated in the unfortunate military expedition of the British to Benin City, through same route in 1897.\n\nOn his part, the Project Director, Dr. Joe Aigboduwa noted, \u201cSeveral governments in Edo State have made attempts and failed, but the present administration, led by Governor Godwin Obaseki, stepped in to ensure the project is realized.\n\n\u201cWe are focusing on three components for the port, which include the access road to the port, the port project itself and the channels leading to the port.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt only about 32km from the Atlantic Ocean, the Benin City River Port is strategically positioned to be the second nearest Port to the coastline in Nigeria, next only to that of Lagos,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the site chosen for the establishment of the port will benefit host communities, adding, \u201cthis will avoid relocating any community.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has debunked media reports that he is planning to float a new political party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nMr Obasanjo, in a statement issued Sunday by his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, said he is no longer interested in partisan politics.\n\n\u201cIn my part of the world, when you say goodnight in a place, you do not go back there and say good evening. The one who reported that may need to visit Yaba Left. And those who believe it can believe that their mothers are men,\u201d the statement quoted Mr Obasanjo as saying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done with partisan politics but by my position in Nigeria and in Africa and without being immodest and indeed in the world my door must be opened and it is open to any individual or group of individuals who want to seek my opinion, view or advice on any issue or matter and I will respond to the best of my ability, without being part of that individual or group\u201d.\n\nAhead of the 2015 general elections, Mr Obasanjo announced his resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party, the party on whose platform he was elected president between 1999 and 2007. The former president also directed a PDP leader to publicly tear his membership card at a press conference organised during a visit by some party members to his home.\n\nRead the full statement below:\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n4th June 2021\n\nOBASANJO NOT FORMING POLITICAL PARTY\n\nThe attention of former President of Nigeria Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has been drawn to unfounded report published in the Vanguard Newspaper with the headline: \u201cNew Party Ahead of 2023: Obasanjo picks 3ex-govs as coordinators, meeting July 13\u201d and dated July 4, 2021.\n\nObasanjo, who is currently in Kabul, Afghanistan, as a guest of President Ashraf Ghani has declared that this report, written by one, Soni Daniel, is false, maintaining that there was no plan to float a new political party now or in near future.\n\nHe said that the fabricated story hardly comes as a surprise because he has, for some time now, observed with bewilderment the efforts by some people to drag him into their political games.\n\nUpon hearing of this latest fabricated report, Chief Obasanjo said \u201cIn my part of the world, when you say goodnight in a place, you do not go back there and say good evening. The one who reported that may need to visit Yaba Left. And those who believe it can believe that their mothers are men.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done with partisan politics but by my position in Nigeria and in Africa and without being immodest and indeed in the world my door must be opened and it is open to any individual or group of individuals who want to seek my opinion, view or advice on any issue or matter and I will respond to the best of my ability, without being part of that individual or group\u201d.\n\nIf anything, Chief Obasanjo\u2019s political party today is the party of Nigerians facing insecurity, unemployment, hunger, poverty, and various other challenging issues. It is the party of Nigeria which must be saved, kept wholesomely united in peace, security, equity, development and progress.\n\nLet those who want to use the back door to force Chief Obasanjo to return to partisan politics respect his choice to remain a non-partisan statesman. On his part, the former President will continue to perform his role as a statesman focused on providing counsel, support, or solutions wherever possible in Nigeria, Africa and indeed the world.\n\nSigned:\n\nKehinde Akinyemi\n\nSpecial Assistant on Media Affairs",

It is the party of Nigeria which must be saved, kept wholesomely united in peace, security, equity, development and progress.\n\n\u201dLet those who want to use the back door to force Chief Obasanjo to return to partisan politics respect his choice to remain a non-partisan statesman. On his part, the former President will continue to perform his role as a statesman focused on providing counsel, support, or solutions wherever possible in Nigeria, Africa and indeed the world,\u201d the statement said.",

          "text": "Jeff Bezos, an American business magnate and the founder and CEO of Amazon, one of the world\u2019s largest technical companies, will leave the company on Monday, exactly 27 years after it was formed.\n\nHowever, as the organization\u2019s executive chair, Bezos will continue to play an important role. He will not be involved in day-to-day operations and will devote more attention to other ventures, including his aerospace firm Blue Origin.\n\nBezos created a set of unconventional leadership ideas during his time as CEO, which some claim are the foundation of his success.\n\nAndy Jassy, the current CEO of Amazon Web Services, will take over as the new CEO.\n\nThe phenomenally successful cloud computing service Amazon Web Services had little to do with Amazon\u2019s core business: e-commerce.\n\nBut Bezos backed the notion, giving Andy Jassy, a trusted employee, the flexibility and resources to start a company within a company.\n\nBezos sees Jassy as an entrepreneur, not just a manager, which is one of the reasons he will succeed Bezos.\n\nEmployees at Amazon attest to Bezos\u2019 customer focus. Profit was a long-term goal for Jeff Bezos. A company\u2019s prosperity hinged on its ability to keep customers satisfied at all costs.\n\nNadia Shouraboura, one of Amazon\u2019s senior managers, told the BBC that when she initially started working for the company in 2004, she expected to be dismissed right away.\n\n\u201cDuring our Christmas high, I committed the biggest mistake of my life,\u201d she admitted.\n\nShouraboura claimed she had placed important products on incorrectly stacked warehouse shelves. Getting the appropriate products off the shelves would cost time and money.\n\n\u201cI devised a creative scheme to ensure that we lose as little money as possible while also solving the problem.\u201d When I told Jeff about it, however, he looked at me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about this all wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pondering how to make the most of your money.\u201d Come back to me in a few weeks and tell me how much it will cost to fix the problem for the clients.\u201d\n\nBezos, on the other hand, has a slew of detractors. Last month, ProPublica published an article claiming to have seen Bezos\u2019 tax records, stating that he owed no taxes in 2007 and 2011. It was a shocking allegation about the richest man on the planet.\n\nOther unfavorable tales about Amazon, like its ruthlessness and charges of monopolistic behavior, have tarnished Bezos\u2019 reputation.\n\nMany of his coworkers, on the other hand, have praised him as a business visionary, a man with a singular purpose who has built a renowned work philosophy and a corporation worth nearly $1.8 trillion.\n\nAlways captivated by space travel, he plans to journey into space later this month with his business Blue Origin\u2019s first crewed voyage.",

What we did today has demonstrated our resolve in achieving the great feat.\n\n\u201cI can be bold to tell everyone here today that you are a true reflection of a revered and respected monarchy and that you are expected to abide by the rules of the game. Fifty-eight years ago, your late father had received his staff of office in a similar fashion that had aroused considerable interest and the same trend is repeating itself today,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further revealed that the institution of monarchy must be presided by a man of courage, commitment and the resilience to protect the interest of the masses who had placed high expectation on the traditional rulers known to have used their fatherly traits in guiding policy makers to do what is right.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Emir Bayero described his appointment and eventual coronation as the 15th Fulani emir of Kano as a significant turning point in the history of the ruling Fulani dynasty over the years and a divine will of God which he considered a great historical epoch.\n\nHe said \u201cmonarchs are always being identified and much revered as custodians of cultural heritage doing what is most expected of them as people were in need of their conventional wisdom to forge ahead stressing that once their wise counsel was ignored, society is pushed to the brink.\u201d\n\nThe monarch said he was fully conversant with the responsibility bestowed on him, given the fact that his mandate was divinely ordained.\n\nHe assured that the fear of God would be his major cardinal thrust and that the people of his domain were also expected to respect such a trajectory at the present critical hour of the nation\u2019s transformation in all spheres of human interest.\n\n\u201cIt is our responsibility to lead people by example in proving to everyone that we are virtuous in whatever we are doing for our avowed mission to fulfil. We are equally reminding our leaders to imbibe the traits of good governance, sacrifice and selflessness.\n\n\u201cWe would be held accountable for whatever we did. God who had created us had assigned us to do what is most right. We are also expected to shun every form of religious and tribal sentiments for our people to live in peace, tranquillity and harmony. We were created by God to live as one and that avoiding primordial interest is the only way out of the present mess,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari lauds choice\n\nIn his remarks, President Muhammadu Buhari described Kano as a bastion of unrivalled cultural heritage second to none in places where traditional authorities hold sway.\n\nHe said it was because of its rich cultural heritage that Kano is widely regarded as a beacon of honour and great pride.\n\nRepresented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the president said Kano is also widely acknowledged as home of every clan race and tribe considering its accommodative posture and hospitality, a rare quality that made it to remain unsurpassed in every sphere of human interest.\n\nBuhari said it was for this reason of hospitality that the ancient city of Kano is adored by everyone.\n\nGanduje makes case for monarchs\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Ganduje has called on the federal government to consider adopting the traditional institution as fourth tier of government.\n\nThe governor called in Kano while inaugurating the inter-tribal traditional leaders association of Nigeria in Kano.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is important to restate that the traditional institution in our society, regardless of the advent of modernisation, remains a rallying point for the generality of our people. It has been serving as a veritable vehicle for the dissemination of government policies, programmes and mobilisation of the populace for same and will continue to remain relevant to the government.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of this, we are clamouring in the constitutional review for a defined role for the institution to be recognized as fourth tier of government and custodians of culture and tradition so that it continue to perform a more prominent part in nation building.\u201d\n\nThe governor also spoke on the need for collaboration between traditional leaders for the country to rid the country of security challenges it faces.\n\n\u201cOur dear nation is passing through a very difficult time in history given the nature of security challenges facing us, including the latest spike in violence that is undermining our corporate existence as a nation.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that our various democratic establishments are capable of managing those tensions and disquiets and would least require ferocity to achieve the peaceful and thriving society of our dreams,\u201d Ganduje said.",

          "text": "Two persons are said to have lost their lives after bandits invaded Bethel Baptist School, a private college in Kaduna State, kidnapping an unspecified number of students.\n\nThe kidnappers in the early hours of Monday attacked the private school located at Maraban Rido within the Chikun Local Government Area of the state.\n\nSources say the marauders came in gun blazing, shooting sporadically into the air before whisking the students away.\n\nFour of the students are said to have escaped while the rest were taken away by the gunmen to an unknown destination.\n\nThis latest kidnap incident comes barely one day after gunmen suspected to be kidnappers attacked the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Centre in Zaria, Kaduna state, abducting no fewer than seven people including nursing mothers.\n\nThe incident was said to have happened in the early hours of Sunday when the bandits invaded the centre and started shooting sporadically.\n\nAmong those kidnapped were seven staff of the centre (two male and five female) and two others who are non-staff.\n\nThe gunmen also attacked the Saye Divisional Police Headquarters also in Zaria and damaged a patrol vehicle with bullets.\n\nAlthough the police authorities are yet to confirm the incident, sources from the area told Channels Television that the gunmen in large numbers had invaded Saye village, blocked the bridge leading to the Leprosy centre, while some others attacked the Saye Divisional police Headquarters, in an attempt to prevent the operatives from foiling the operation.\n\nA plethora of kidnappings\n\nCriminal groups, known as \u201cbandits\u201d by the authorities, have for quite some time been terrorizing parts of the northwest and centre of the nation, attacking villages, stealing cattle, and kidnapping people for ransom.\n\nZamfara, Katsina, Niger, and Kaduna have been the most attacked by the bandits, with the situation in the latter state deteriorating at an exponential rate.\n\nMost disheartening about the attack in Kaduna is the fact that most of the kidnappings are focused on citadels of learning, leading to the mass abductions of students for ransom.\n\nA prior warning\n\nFour days ago, Governor Nasir El-Rufai told newsmen that he has withdrawn his children from a public school in Kaduna after getting wind of a plot to kidnap his son.\n\nThe governor had in September 2019, enrolled his six-year-old son, Abubakar-Sadiq into Kaduna Capital School, a public school located in the Kaduna State capital, in order to show leadership to revamp public education in the state and make it more competitive.\n\nBut in an interview with the BBC, El-Rufai noted that available security reports revealed that three bandit groups were planning to abduct his son from the school, a situation which he also notes will expose other children to grave danger.\n\nThe Governor also disclosed that he had enrolled Sadiq\u2019s younger sister, Nasrine in the same school after turning six years, before the security development, thereby forcing the family to withdraw the two children from the public school temporarily.\n\n\u201cMy son is registered in the school because his sister also became six years of age and we registered her in the school but we\u2019ve had to temporarily withdraw them for the security of the school because we got intercept from at least two groups that are planning to attack the school to kidnap my son,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will succeed because there will be enough security there to prevent it but other children may be placed in danger. We have no idea what weapons they will come with.\u201d\n\nHe however said that his two children are currently homeschooling, and are only going to Capital School to write exams, with the hope of returning to Kaduna Capital School when security improves.\n\nThe governor further explained that his family took the decision to withdraw his son and daughter based on the advice of security agents, and in order not to put the school at risk of being attacked by bandits.\n\nRansom For Bandits?\n\nAs Kaduna State and other parts of the north-western region continue to experience the scourge of banditry, El-Rufai has been one of those few governors that have repeatedly kicked against the payment of ransom to kidnappers.\n\nHe also reiterated his administration\u2019s stance, explaining that three groups intercepted had vowed to abduct his children to see if he would make a U-turn on the payment of ransom.\n\nThe Kaduna Governor has insisted that the state government has no money to pay bandits amid the renewed attacks by armed groups in the state.\n\nHe stated that the recent bandits\u2019 attacks on communities in the state were a result of the government\u2019s decision that it would not negotiate with them.\n\n\u201cWe have a feeling that the renewed attacks in Kaduna are not unconnected to the position that we have taken as a government that we will not negotiate with criminals,\u201d said the governor who was a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Sunday Politics.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe will not give them any money and they will not make any profit from Kaduna; anyone that comes to Kaduna will not get a penny from the state government, except he will get a bullet instead.\u201d\n\nAccording to Governor El-Rufai, the security challenges being witnessed in the northwest region of the country have been existing for some years and gradually evolving and getting worse with time.\n\nHe was confident that while the state government does not have any reason to change his position, the military would wipe out the bandits from the region.",

That\u2019s a positive sign.\u201d\n\nA key difference from 2018 is heightened expectation, with Southgate himself admitting their benchmark in Russia was to end England\u2019s 12-year wait for a knockout victory.\n\nThe former international defender now has more knockout wins than any previous England manager and will go looking for another in Wednesday\u2019s semi-final bolstered by a boisterous partisan crowd of 60,000-plus at Wembley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be coming back now,\u201d said Southgate, who expects teenager Bukayo Saka to return to training on Monday after missing the Ukraine match with a slight knock.\n\n\u201cTo go and have that different environment, preparation, focus was definitely helpful. But now to be coming back to Wembley is a great thing for us.\u201d\n\nSouthgate says going through \u201creal-life experiences together\u201d such as the sickening racism experienced in Montenegro and Bulgaria in Euro 2020 qualifiers has helped create a bond among his players.\n\nSemi-final opponents Denmark have also been brought closer together following Christian Eriksen\u2019s cardiac arrest in their group opener. The Inter Milan player needed resuscitation on the pitch before a successful operation in hospital.\n\n\u201cWe talk about perspective in sport but we rarely have it,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThis was a moment that brought it home for all of us.\n\n\u201cI can also imagine what it has done for the Danish team, their bond.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about the things we have been through but what they went through that day \u2014 the way their captain was and the way the group was \u2014 and how that would have connected with their supporters.

          "text": "Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, Monday, inaugurated the state\u2019s Economic Advisory Council to help drive the economy of the state.\n\nThe high-worth Council was inaugurated virtually.\n\nWhile inaugurating the Council, the Governor challenged members to \u201cguide the state into prosperity\u201d , tapping into the abundant human and mineral resources available to her.\n\nHe said the members were carefully selected based on their pedigree and track record, saying their main responsibility is to work with the state to \u201copen new doors of opportunities towards economic diversification\u201d.\n\nThe Governor said the way out is for the nation to go back to the days of agricultural boom as well as devise a way of optimizing the abundant mineral resources in the country.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs you know, Agriculture was the pride of the nation before the discovery of oil, in the 60s, but the coming of it, utterly neutralized the gains in Agriculture and stalled the progress in other sectors, as well. The entity called Nigeria is so naturally blessed, with the potential to be one of the leading country in the world but the circumstances of oil and all the issues around it, has made this very difficult to realize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that, crude oil, in Nigeria, is suffering declining relevance and may actually become extinct, with the passage of time or become totally irrelevant, due to improvements in renewable energy over environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cIn 2016 and 2020 respectively, Nigeria was ushered into a recession over the collapse of the price of crude oil. This, for me, underlines the fragility of our economy and, indeed, a wake-up call, that we must begin to think beyond oil, if we are to be sustainable, as a nation and, by extension, if we are to survive, as a State.\n\n\u201cAs you know, Kogi State is vastly blessed with human and natural resources, that are yet to be optimally harnessed for the good of our people. The available data indicates that, we have over 29 solid minerals in commercial quantity. In addition, we are blessed with the confluence of Rivers Niger and Benue, we are a gateway to the FCT, we are bordered by 10 States including FCT, we are blessed with considerable arable land, we are blessed with potentially world class tourist sites, we are blessed with leading cash crops such as cashew, cassava, rice etc, we are blessed with high profile industries such as Ajaokuta, Itakpe Iron Ore, Obanaja Cement Company, we can go on and on. We cannot and must not, therefore, be complacent, in the face of these enormous blessings and see our people, our State struggling with basic necessities of life\u201d.\n\nHe informed the Council that the rational behind the establishment of the Confluence University of Science and Technology, Osara was to create local capacity and strategically position the state to take advantage of the abundant mineral resources she boasts of.\n\nThe Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council, Mr Aliyu Nda Salami while responding on behalf of the other members, thanked the Governor for the intrinsic confidence reposed in them, saying they have resolved to hit the ground running and change the fortunes of the state for good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the Governor has taken the right step by bringing together, a crack team to move the economy of the state forward.\n\nThe Council\u2019s membership is testament to the intimidating profiles of Kogites in different spheres of endeavors.\n\nMembers of the Council are: Aliyu Inda Salami as Chairman, H.E Amb Olusiji Godwin Aina as Alternate Chairman, Chief Engr Joseph Makoju, OON, OFR (FNSE), Member; Chief Kola Jamodu , CFR (FCA), Member; Dr. Aheruvoh David Ohiku,Member; Emmanuel E.

          "title": "F1: Lewis Hamilton Says Max Verstappen \u2018Walking Away With It\u2019 after Austrian Grand Prix",
          "text": "Max Verstappen won\u2019t say it, but the reality is that he is in pretty much total control of this year\u2019s Formula 1 championship battle after victory in Sunday\u2019s Austrian Grand Prix.\n\nThe Red Bull driver has taken four wins in the past five races and only did not win them all because his left rear tyre exploded when he was leading five laps from the end of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.\n\nTwo months ago, after Lewis Hamilton won the Spanish Grand Prix to take the Mercedes driver\u2019s third win of the opening four races, Verstappen was 14 points behind the seven-time champion.\n\nNow, with nine races completed, Verstappen leads Hamilton by 32 points. There may well be, as Verstappen keeps reminding everyone, a long way to go \u2013 although with the pandemic still in full swing, no one is quite sure exactly how many races there will be this season \u2013 but it is looking harder and harder to see a way back for Hamilton from this.\n\nAs Hamilton put it himself on Sunday: \u201cMax is walking away with it right now and there is not really much we can do about it.\u201d\n\nVerstappen\u2019s second win within a week at the Red Bull Ring was pretty much a carbon copy of the first. He was the fastest man all weekend, he took pole, and he serenely drove away into a race of his own from the moment the lights went out.\n\nIt is not completely clear how much of a challenge Hamilton might have been able to mount, because the world champion started only fourth and took 20 laps to find a way by Lando Norris\u2019 McLaren on a stellar weekend for the 21-year-old Briton.\n\nBy the time he had, Verstappen was long gone and continued to pull away. No-one at Mercedes seriously thought they had a chance against Verstappen on Sunday.\n\nHamilton should have finished second, but when a piece of aerodynamically critical bodywork fell off the rear of his car as he went over the kerbs on the exit of Turn 10 in the normal manner at about lap 29, he lost more than 0.5 seconds-worth of performance a lap.\n\nMercedes hoped they might be able to use his team-mate Valtteri Bottas to protect Hamilton from Norris, but when it became clear that was not going to be possible because of Hamilton\u2019s lack of pace \u2013 and rapidly deteriorating tyres \u2013 they swapped their cars, and Hamilton fell behind Norris as well to finish fourth.\n\nThe weekend had gone so smoothly for Verstappen \u2013 who was serenaded on his way to victory by a crowd of 60,000 that seemed to be almost entirely composed of orange-clad fans from his home country \u2013 that he could barely believe it.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into the weekend, everyone sees you as the favourite,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s never easy to always deliver what we did today. So a great effort by the whole team. The whole package over these two weeks here has been incredible.\u201d\n\nAnd on the championship fight, he just keeps coming back to the same old mantra.\n\n\u201cI am enjoying it but I am very focused on the rest of the season,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cIt is still so long and there are still a lot of points you need to score. We need to make sure we are back up there every weekend and use the whole potential of the car. We were very dominant in Austria but we have to make sure we are there again in Silverstone.\u201d\n\nThe raw statistics of the past few races look bleak for Mercedes, but there is some light in the clouds. Lest we forget, Hamilton would have won in France two weeks ago but for a team strategic error, and next up is the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, which at least in historical terms is very much a Mercedes circuit.\n\nMercedes engineers believe that some of the explanation for their relatively poor performance in Austria is track specific, and that the nature of Silverstone should swing the performance back towards them.\n\nAt the same time, though, there is no doubting Red Bull have made a significant step forward with their car in recent races, with developments to the floor, diffuser, front wing, nose and barge boards, and Mercedes have brought none.\n\nThere will be some Mercedes upgrades at Silverstone, although Bottas said he thought they might be the last ones. A lot is hanging on them. Will they, and the track, be enough to allow Mercedes to take Red Bull on once more? And what about the races after that?\n\n\u201cThey have added so much performance,\u201d Hamilton said, \u201cand we have a lot of work to do to try and close that gap.\n\n\u201cI hope our car feels better [at Silverstone]. It has been pretty poor here the last two weeks \u2013 it has definitely been a painful few races. But we will keep our heads up and keep trying.\n\n\u201cWe will work as much as we can to improve in the next couple of weeks. We have been massively down at this track. It will be interesting to see how it is in the other races to go.\u201d\n\nTeam boss Toto Wolff, meanwhile, was spinning the positives.\n\n\u201cI am always a sceptical person, half-empty glass, but I am seeing the positives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have 13-14 races to go. We are one retirement away from Red Bull and we have lost more points than we should have lost to our own mistakes.\n\n\u201cClearly in Austria the last two races we did not have the performance we must have in order to fight Red Bull and we need to get our act together in every single area and hopefully perform better on the other tracks.\n\n\u201cLosing 13 or 14 points is not great but this is still the long game. It is against the odds for us now, and that\u2019s clear because they have a performance advantage and you can see that.\n\n\u201cBut all these years I have tried to keep our feet on the ground by not being carried away with performance and now I need to do the opposite.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to give up at this stage of the season. We are not going to give up at any time unless it is not mathematically possible any more to win this championship.\n\n\u201cSo we need to see things optimistically rather than pessimistically like we have done in the past.\u201d\n\nRight now, there is a distinct sense that Red Bull, after eight years of being starved of success, are throwing everything at this campaign and taking a bit of a gamble with 2022 in a season in which teams are battling caps on budgets and research and development while designing a car to an entirely new philosophy of rules next term.\n\nWolff has made it clear that Mercedes have already thrown all their development work on to 2022, even if there are still some new parts coming through the production pipeline.\n\nRed Bull, by contrast, are very much not saying that and team principal Christian Horner\u2019s tone is very different to Wolff\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYou have to go week by week, race by race,\u201d Horner said on Sunday, \u201cand the team is doing a great job of balancing the challenges of this year and next. It is nothing new, we have had big regulation changes in the past. You just have to balance your resource and apply it to what needs it most.\u201d\n\nHamilton will not be looking at it this way yet, but if the long run of success he has enjoyed is brought to an end by Verstappen this season, there is always next year, or the year after.\n\nOver the weekend, it was announced that Hamilton had signed another two-year deal with Mercedes, and, while there was never any prospect of him stepping away from the sport, he said that the excitement of the battle with Verstappen had strengthened his resolve to carry on.\n\n\u201cThe start of this season when the cars were so close in performance \u2013 pretty much equal \u2013 it was one of the most exciting times I\u2019ve had for some time to have this battle with Red Bull,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\n\u201cI was really hoping it would continue on like that but as you have seen they have taken a huge leap forwards.\n\n\u201cLast year was a long journey, it is a good time to reflect and I found myself waking up thinking about racing and now we\u2019re having this tight battle it has brought me closer to the team and it is making me dig deeper and I love that. I guess it has been reinvigorating on the love I have for the sport.\u201d\n\nStill, Hamilton will be approaching 39 by the end of his new contract and his career is clearly closer to the end than the beginning.\n\nBut the notion that British representation at the top of F1 will continue long after he has gone was reinforced over the weekend by two outstanding performances from Norris and George Russell.\n\nBoth were brilliant in qualifying \u2013 Norris putting the McLaren second on the grid and Russell guiding a Williams into the top 10 for the first time \u2013 and in the race.\n\nNorris may well have beaten Bottas to second place had he not been controversially punished with a five-second time penalty for pushing Verstappen\u2019s team-mate Sergio Perez wide on the first full lap of racing \u2013 he finished just two seconds behind the Mercedes.\n\nAnd Russell lost out on a first point for Williams only after 10 laps of redoubtable defence against, of all people, two-time champion Fernando Alonso.\n\n\u201cI felt a little bit sad for George,\u201d Alonso said, \u201cbecause he drove an amazing weekend and when I saw P10 was him, I was hoping it would be anyone but him.\n\n\u201cI had much better tyres and much better traction out of Turn Three and I could make the move three laps from the end. He will have more opportunities hopefully for podiums or wins in the future.\u201d\n\nA couple of races ago Alonso and Russell swapped helmets. Alonso wrote on the one he gave Russell: \u201cGeorge, you rock! Future world champion.\u201d\n\nFew would disagree \u2013 and about Norris, too.",

          "title": "Pope \u2018Reacted Well\u2019 to Intestinal Surgery: Vatican",
          "text": "Pope Francis \u201creacted well\u201d to planned intestinal surgery Sunday evening at a Rome hospital, the Vatican said, without giving much detail about the pontiff\u2019s condition.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, a Holy See spokesman, Matteo Bruni, said the 84-year-old Francis had general anesthesia during the surgery necessitated by a narrowing of the large intestine.\n\nThe written statement, which came shortly before midnight, was notable for its scarcity of medical detail.\n\nBruni didn\u2019t say how long surgery lasted, nor for how long the pope was unconscious under anesthesia.\n\nAlso not immediately clear was how long Francis would stay Rome\u2019s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic, a Catholic hospital, although he was expected to convalesce for a few days in a private 10th floor apartment suite reserved for popes.\n\n\u201cThe Holy Father, admitted in the afternoon to A. Gemelli Polyclinic, underwent in the evening planned surgery for a diverticular stenosis of the sigmoid\u201d portion of the colon, Bruni said in the brief written statement. \u201cThe Holy Father reacted well to the surgery conducted under general anesthesia,\u201d the spokesman said, noting there was a four-person surgical team, plus a four-person anesthesiologist team.\n\nA stenosis is an abnormal constriction or narrowing. The sigmoid portion of the large intestine extends from the end of the descending colon to the rectum. Gastroenterologists say the sigmoid segment is a common location for a diverticular stenosis.\n\nThe main surgeon was Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the director of Gemelli\u2019s digestive surgery department.\n\nAmong those present in the operating room was the official papal physician, whom Francis tapped earlier this year. The pope\u2019s previous physician had contracted COVID-19 and died at Gemelli while hospitalized for cancer treatment.\n\nIt was a remarkable end to a day that began publicly for Francis when, during his traditional Sunday appearance to the faithful in St. Peter\u2019s Square, he cheerfully announced he would go to Hungary and Slovakia in September.\n\nThe pope made no mention of his impending surgery, but headed shortly after his window appearance to the hospital. At the end of his public remarks from an Apostolic Palace window, Francis told the crowd: \u201cAnd please, don\u2019t forget to pray for me.\u201d Then he added, sounding casual, almost wistfully: \u201cThanks, ciao.\u201d\n\nA couple hours after he was admitted, reportedly arriving with little escort and no fanfare, the Vatican revealed that Francis had been diagnosed with a narrowing in the large intestine.\n\nA week earlier, Francis had used his same Sunday appearance to ask the public for special prayers for himself, which may have been related to the planned surgery.\n\n\u201cI ask you to pray for the pope, pray in a special way,\u201d Francis had asked the faithful in the square on June 27. \u201cThe pope needs your prayers,\u201d he said, adding his thanks and saying \u201cI know you will do that.\u201d\n\nA diverticulum is pouch-like protrusion through the muscular wall of the intestine.\n\nWhen diverticula become inflamed \u2014 a common condition, especially in older people \u2014 part of the intestine can sometimes narrow and surgery might be required, according to gastroenterologists. Such surgery can be performed under general anesthesia, possibly with a laparoscopic intervention. Sometimes a re-sectioning of the affected part of the intestine is needed.\n\nFrancis is in generally good health, but he did have part of one lung removed as a young man. He also suffers from sciatica, in which a nerve affects the lower back and leg, a painful condition that has forced him at times to skip scheduled appearances.\n\nThe pope had a particularly demanding set of appointments last week, including celebrating a Mass on Tuesday to mark the Catholic feast day honoring Saints Peter and Paul, and later in the week, presiding at a special prayer service for Lebanon. On June 28, he also had a long private audience at the Vatican with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Throughout all those engagements, Francis appeared to be in good spirits.\n\nGet-well wishes began arriving immediately for Francis. Italian President Sergio Mattarella, as soon as he landed in Paris for a state visit in France, offered an \u201caffectionate thought\u201d on behalf of all Italians. Mattarella said he was wishing for \u201ca good convalescence and even a speedier recovery\u201d for the pope.\n\nGemelli doctors have performed surgery before on popes, notably Pope John Paul II, who had what the Vatican said was a benign tumor in his colon removed in 1992. John Paul had several other surgeries at the hospital, including after being shot by a gunman in St. Peter\u2019s Square in 1981. After those surgeries, the Vatican and hospital officials gave detailed accounts of the pope\u2019s medical condition.\n\nJohn Paul also had several medical issues in his final years, including severe complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease, and had numerous stays at Gemelli. At one point, the future St. John Paul II dubbed the hospital \u201cthe third Vatican,\u201d after Vatican City and the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome.",
