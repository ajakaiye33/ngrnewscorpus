          "title": "Northern elder condemns Obasanjo on Atiku, says he\u2019s a betrayer",
          "text": "By Abdulmumin Murtala, Kano\n\nFollowing the recent statement by former president Olusegun Obasanjo, regretting having Atiku Abubakar as vice president, a northern elder in Kano, the founder and president of the Patriotic Elders of Nigeria (PEN), Dr Bature Abdulaziz mon has condemned the utterances and described Obasanjo as a betrayer.\n\nHe stated this while speaking to Vanguard in Kano on Wednesday adding that Obasanjo is only expressing hatred and bitterness against the north and northerners hiding behind Atiku even as he was brought to power by massive support of the north he enjoyed.\n\nBature added that it was Obasanjo\u2019s bitterness that drove away people around him while in power and not Atiku and he is blackmailing him in support of his tribesman as 2023 election is by the door.\n\n\u201cOn what former president Olusegun Obasanjo is mentioned by the media to have uttered negative statement against former Vice President Abubakar Atiku, even if one is not a politician, out of patriotism, he must respond and understand that there is need to support Atiku.\n\n\u201cEven as Obasanjo\u2019s wrongs should not affect Tinubu, but what Obasanjo said that he regrets making Atiku his vice is uncalled for and is clearly to blackmail Atiku in support of his tribesman.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that whenever Obasanjo intends to address the public he starts by taking whisky. He will then go and say anything he wants because he is used to saying all sorts of trash and nothing happens.\n\n\u201cIf he has forgotten, we Nigerians have not. A victim of any form of molestation or crime will never forget the perpetrator, and we will never forget what Obasanjo did.\n\n\u201cIn his first election as president, it were the northerners that supported and brought in Obasanjo. They gave him over sixty percent of the votes he got and not the south west or the south east. He was brought in to power by the support of the north.\n\n\u201cPrior to Obasanjo\u2019s second election, because of his kind of ungratefulness and bitterness, all those supporting him had to dump him.\n\n\u201cThat was how Atiku came to enjoy more support than him.\n\nIn short, when the time for the second election came, and he understood that Atiku was already prepared to defeat him, for those Nigerians who know this, Obasanjo had to come before Atiku on his knees begging to be allowed a second term. There are pictures to prove this. That was when Atiku withdrew for him prior to the primary election to allow him to win.\n\n\u201cBut as soon as he emerged president in the second term he turned all his evil forces against Atiku. It was such that if Atiku were to die, he would have been killed over and over again by Obasanjo. Obasanjo was all out to eliminate Atiku. He did this severally but could not succeed against Atiku. That was how he ended his regime with bitterness against Atiku.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, with all the wrongs he did to Atiku, Atiku sees everything as a bygone and holds nothing against Obasanjo and Obasanjo also remained quiet as though it was all well. Seeing that the 2023 election is by the door side Obasanjo is now erupting and starting another attack against Atiku again.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you this, any northerner that supports what Obasanjo is saying against Atiku should understand that Obasanjo sees Atiku in the same manner as he sees every other northerner. Obasanjo hates the north in just the same way he hates Atiku.\n\n\u201cHe was brought in and supported by northerners and he has now turned his back against them in betrayal. All these things I am saying are known to all Nigerians including you the newsmen.\n\n\u201cObasanjo has molested the north and the northerners since they brought him to power.\n\nJust imagine this kind of statement expressing extreme hatred against Atiku thinking that he can damage him. Let me tell you something, the way and manner in which Obasanjo is expressing hatred against Atiku is the same as he hates even the animals that come from the north talk less of the northerners themselves.\n\n\u201cI want to be bold here, just as Obasanjo is saying he regrets knowing Atiku, every northerner should also say he regrets ever knowing Obasanjo as well because he hates the north and northerners and will never like them in his life.\n\n\u201cI am not saying this to support any political party, I am saying this out of patriotism to expose Obasanjo. He oppressed Atiku during his regime and wants to continue that now that Atiku is out to contest\u201d the PEN president stated.",

As people of faith we should remember that Hajj is a divine call that one would answer at the destined time; no matter one\u2019s wealth, health status, age or free time.\n\n\u201cNAHCON assures those unable to proceed for the Hajj that their Hajj fare deposits are untouched and safe. Thus, the Commission will order release of their monies to them without delay should they request for a refund. If they decide otherwise, they should be rest assured that they will not be short changed in anyway.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, NAHCON had sought for waiver for Hajj officials above 65 years of age who due to their relevance to the Hajj operation, their presence in Saudi Arabia is crucial. This request too was turned down by Saudi Arabia. Hence any official above 65 years is exempted from participating in the 2022 Hajj duties.\n\n\u201cWhile soliciting for the understanding of all concerned and indeed the general public, the Commission sincerely regrets all the inconveniences as well as all such obvious/likely losses associated with the incidences highlighted about.\u201d",

This is in addition to welfare packages introduced by the current leadership of the NA.\n\n\u201cMore also, aside prompt payment of salaries and operational allowances, welfare flights have been inaugurated, which significantly reduced the burden of troops travelling in and out of the theatres to see their loved ones. This is also in addition to huge commitment on the medical needs of wounded-in-action officers and soldiers and the barracks communities. Scholarships are also being awarded to children of officers and soldiers killed in action in the ongoing operations\u201d.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cthe attention of the Nigerian Army(NA) has been drawn to yet another mischievous report peddled by some online media, alleging serving officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army are planning to storm Abuja, to protest over unpaid emoluments, poor working conditions and other unsubstantiated allegations.\n\n\u201cJudging by the unprofessional and irresponsible manner in which the release was made, citing faceless persons, it could have been ignored. However, the weighty nature of the claims demands some clarification for the sake of well meaning Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note, that across all NA Barracks there are deliberate efforts at providing conducive working and living conditions for troops and their families. These interventions in the form of massive barracks construction and renovation works, with visible footprints are bringing succour to NA personnel nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe desperate effort by the authors of this unpatriotic report to give ethnic and religious coloration to the activities of the NA, is nothing but an inglorious attempt to woo unsuspecting members of the public with bigotry bargains, laced heavily with evil intent. It must be made crystal clear that the NA remains a symbol of national unity and therefore cannot afford to be divided along ethnic or religious lines.\n\n\u201csuffice to state that the NA under the current leadership has remained resolute in carrying out its constitutional role and will vigorously continue to implement welfare programs for the benefit of all personnel.\n\n\u201cTroops deployed in ongoing operational engagements are putting in their best for the nation and should be encouraged, rather than plotting disaffection amongst them. All personnel are urged to remain steadfast and unswayed by the antics of unpatriotic elements, who for selfish gains want to plunge the nation into chaos.\u201d",

We must not allow these dire threats to come to pass.\n\nFulani group picks APC nomination f...

That is the test of our democratic credentials, systems and practices. I have since the conclusion of the processes been inundated with various reports and complaints,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari assured that the leadership of the APC would sustain the hearing and healing process it started to ensure fairness, justice and oneness before the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with our ethos, therefore, I shall continue to address the ensuing challenges and grievances through the party machinery while paying keen attention to the outcomes.\n\n\u201cI must also remind you of the primacy of justice in all our actions. If justice is denied, the outcome is usually unpleasant.\n\n\u201cThis is because you are the members who keep the party running. I should add that as part of the policy of using the party machinery for effective resolution of conflict, the Chairman and some members of the National Working Committee visited the National Assembly recently to dialogue with our legislators.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party is currently addressing the outcomes as part of the way forward. I am encouraging all the party functionaries to adhere to the truth and to be fair to all parties in any dispute.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari told the senators that the strength and victory of the party in the election would depend on unity of members and ability to prevent injustices or heal them, perceived or real.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs the leader of the party, one of my primary roles is to ensure that our culture of internal democracy and dispute resolution is strengthened by creating the opportunity for members to ventilate their opinions, views and grievances at different levels.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that we have accomplished 23 years of uninterrupted democratic governance, our journey is still in a nascent stage and we continue to learn from our challenges and mistakes. Similarly, our party is still evolving in its culture and practices and it is my expectation and hope that we shall attain a mature level in our internal conduct.\u201d\n\nThe president assured that \u201cjustice shall prevail, aggrieved members shall be assuaged and the interest of the party and the nation shall be protected.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari thanked the senators for suggesting a meeting on the issues, which include the future of the party and pursuing solutions to the challenges thrown up by the recent election related activities, particularly, the primaries.\n\nAfter the meeting, Kalu said the aggrieved Senators would no longer pursue defection from the APC.\n\nHe said on his social media page: \u201cEarlier this afternoon, I led the 22 aggrieved Senators and members of the All Progressive Congress to President Muhammad Buhari, GCFR,\u201d Kalu said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur meeting with Mr President was successful and the issue of decamping from our party has been laid to rest.\u201d",

Abdulrahman Danbazau, said it is a necessity for Nigeria as a country to meet up with international standard on treatment of inmates and the facilities hosting them.\n\nDanbazau maintained that though Nigeria is making progress on the prison reform, there is still the need to continue advocacy for decongestion of correctional centres.\n\nHe said congestion of correction centres is a major challenge that must be permanently addressed.",

But the party is supreme,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, some of us have resorted to prayers. I have been in hibernation. We\u2019ve resorted to prayer: \u2018Lord God, where do we go from here.\u2019 I believe as a Christian that power belongs to God. The Bible says a man can receive nothing except it is given to him from above.\n\n\u201cI am praying. I have gone into hibernation. I am fasting and praying. So in the end, if God directs me that I should support Atiku, why should I not do it? After all, he\u2019s my party member. But I am waiting for him to do more. I expect him to reach out to Wike, who came second in the presidential primary. The man he denied the popular view of the PDP members \u2014 14 out of 17 \u2014 who said Wike should be the vice-presidential candidate. I expect more explanation.

He\u2019s somebody who stood for the party and made sure that things worked. Some of us believed in him, but unfortunately, it was somebody else. But the party is supreme,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, some of us have resorted to prayers. I have been in hibernation. We\u2019ve resorted to prayer: \u2018Lord God, where do we go from here.\u2019 I believe as a Christian that power belongs to God. The Bible says a man can receive nothing except it is given to him from above.\n\n\u201cI am praying. I have gone into hibernation. I am fasting and praying.

          "title": "How will Tinubu, Atiku, Peter Obi address insecurity?",
          "text": "Nigeria is caught in a maelstrom. Ravagers roam across the land unchallenged, extracting tolls in tears and blood from citizens. They expropriate land and govern according to their lust for violence. There is hopelessness in the streets as the country sinks deeper and deeper into a bloodfest. Insecurity will be the toughest trial of the next administration.\n\nInsurgency, banditry and kidnapping have become a quotidian aspect of the Nigerian life. Killings and kidnappings have persisted with each incident surpassing the previous in gruesomeness, audacity and ruthlessness.\n\nOver 5,067 citizens were reported killed in 2021 \u2013 according to TheCable Index. 14 Nigerians were killed every day from January to December, 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, 1,743 Nigerians were killed \u2014 with Niger, Zamfara topping the list of victims. This figure surpassed the number of civilians reportedly killed in the first month of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nLast Thursday, a divisional police officer (DPO) who was leading his men to rescue kidnap victims in Nasarawa was himself stolen by these dare-devil freebooters. His abductors demanded five million naira before he would be freed. What could be more embarrassing? A few days ago, some residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) were kidnapped on their farm. In Niger, Zamfara and Kaduna, citizens have resigned to a doomed existence. The situation appears hopeless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigerians held high hopes for the Buhari administration because of the president\u2019s promise to roll back the crushing boulder of insecurity. There was a surfeit of hope and trust in the president being a retired army general. But clearly, the administration is overwhelmed and has surrendered to the fierce and cold grip of these death-dealers from the netherworld.\n\nHow will Bola Tinubu, APC presidential candidate; Atiku Abubakar, PDP presidential candidate, and Peter Obi, Labour Party presidential candidate, address this challenge? What is their experience in managing crises? What solutions have they suggested in their public statements? And how did they respond to security troubles in their time in public office?\n\nWe need to stir disciplined conversations on the most pressing issues \u2013 not inanities \u2014 and interrogate those that have come forward to lead the country on matters of governance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBOLA TINUBU\n\nTinubu has been an advocate of state police. He had emphasised the primacy of state police a number of times in public discourses. In a statement in 2020, the APC presidential candidate said state policing is the viable path to securing Nigeria and Nigerians. Hear him: \u201cThe time has come to take the necessary legal actions to allow for the creation of state police and the recruitment and training of many more police officers. Such state-created forces should be based on the modern tenets of community policing and optimal relations and cooperation with local communities. Measures such as these are needed to cure present gaps in how military and law enforcement treat the general public.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt is obvious the present security set-up cannot guarantee the protection of citizens. Recently, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, whose state has suffered much devastation from the devilment of terrorists, called for the creation of state police. Bello Matawalle, another governor whose state (Zamfara) is in the throes of terror, a few days ago asked residents to take up firearms and defend themselves. What could be more depressing?\n\nReally, I agree there is a need for the retooling of the current security architecture which is unwieldy and cannot cover many parts of the country, leaving ungoverned spaces for terrorists to annex. But if Tinubu becomes president, can he pull off the creation of state police? The national assembly has a critical role to play as well as the state houses of assembly because the constitution will need to be amended to accommodate the new force. Currently, policing is the exclusive preserve of the federal government. I believe unbundling the current policing arrangement where orders will have to come from Abuja for an operation in Okitipupa is long overdue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPETER OBI\n\nObi has been unequivocal about the place of job creation as a counteragent to insecurity. He has said many times that unemployment is the instigator of insecurity. I agree, but not absolutely.\n\nThe Labour Party presidential candidate once said: \u201cThe state of insecurity under this administration is the worst the country has ever experienced. To address it, we need to look at the economy and focus on reversing the loss of jobs.\u2019\u2019\n\nUnemployment is a vector of insecurity, no doubt. But it is simplistic to assume that unemployment is the sole agent of the crisis. I will grade job creation; welfare guarantees and provision of common facilities as basic duties of government. But insecurity goes deeper than job statistics. Even countries like the US with relatively impressive job statistics are still plagued by violent crimes. So, essentially Peter Obi needs to work out his security blueprint and strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nATIKU ABUBAKAR\n\nAtiku\u2019s antiserum to insecurity is the mixture of job creation and boosting the police number. He has said on different occasions that with job creation and effective policing the crime rate will plummet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery part of this country is dealing with one aspect of insecurity or the other, I will be very tough on law and order. I will increase the number of policemen in this country. I will equip them, I will also increase the number of the armed forces, equip them very well, just like we did from 1999 to 2015. It is only when you secure the country, there is peace, there is law and order, you can deal with economic challenges,\u2019\u2019 he said in May at a meeting with delegates in Ogun state.\n\nI agree with Atiku on his prescription. But are we not taking the same route as before as regards recruiting more police officers? It has been done before, but what has changed? In the past, as it is in the present, the recruitment of police officers was often steeped in controversy and allegations of corruption. Will Atiku alter the status quo, if he becomes president?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI urge the candidates to release their security strategy documents so that Nigerians can better assess their readiness to address this challenge. It should not be the same perfunctory performances and histrionics \u2013 Nigeria is at war.\n\nBy Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "\u201cThe future of work for African startups is in distributed offices\u201d and other ideas from VivaTech, one of Europe\u2019s largest tech conferences",
          "text": "May 14\n\nAt about 5:45 PM CET on May 14, I arrived at the Gare du Nord station in Paris, France. It was rowdy, with a mix of different people who had just arrived in the city or were about to leave. A typical sight at one of the city\u2019s 6 large mainline railway station terminals.\n\nI had travelled to Paris for VivaTech, one of Europe\u2019s largest tech conferences. Founded in 2016, VivaTech has hosted 36,000 startups, 3,300 investors, and numerous business leaders and innovators such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma and Tim Cook.\n\nI planned to arrive a few hours earlier for the Viva AfricArena event at Station F, but a 90-minute train delay made it impossible.\n\nMy first stop was Rue Montorgueil, a street lined with restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bakeries, fish stores, cheese shops, and wine shops. About 100 VivaTech attendees filled the street chatting and drinking at Viva Night, a networking event.\n\nTo satisfy my hunger, I bought shawarma\u2014starting with familiar food\u2014and a drink, before going on to chat with a few startup founders from Africa and Europe.\n\nExhausted from a long day of dragging my suitcases around, I decided to book an Uber to my Airbnb, so I wouldn\u2019t have to keep asking people for directions.\n\nOver the course of the 45-minute ride, I had a light-hearted conversation with the driver who lives in Paris but is from Algeria. His English wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was good enough for him to dish out some words of advice on why I should get married soon.\n\n\u201cJe parle Anglais,\u201d was a standard disclaimer I gave to almost everyone who started speaking to me in French, telling them that I only speak English. Growing up, I had learnt French at every level of my education but was never in the right environment long enough to practise speaking it.\n\nLater, as I settled into my Airbnb room, I made an attempt to watch TV but embarrassingly caught myself scrolling through the stations, looking for an English-speaking channel. So much for using not being in the right environment as an excuse for my incapacity with French. I didn\u2019t bother turning on the TV after that day.\n\nMay 15\n\nAt 9:59 AM, I arrived at the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles. There was a large crowd outside the venue waiting to enter. I was about an hour late because I had to get a SIM card to wean myself off my dependence on public WiFi.\n\nThe conference started on a high note with a teeming crowd and positive energy. After a bit of queuing, I got inside and was fascinated to see more than 100 African startups present\u2014most of them serving francophone African countries.\n\nIt felt odd that there was no Nigerian booth at the conference, considering that countries like Egypt and South Africa had booths. I later learned from someone involved in trying to organise a Nigerian delegation that the current focus on the 2023 election cycle was a major reason why the government didn\u2019t sponsor a delegation.\n\nOver the next few days at the conference, talking to many of these startups made me more aware of the francophone African tech ecosystem and the different people and organisations working to make it thrive.\n\nConversations and sessions\n\nWith startups stationed in shared 3-by-3-metre booths all over the conference venue, I walked to different booths seeking to learn more about what they did.\n\nI spoke to Julien Herbin of Kayfo Games, a startup based in Senegal, who explained that making games from Dakar had a few limitations as he couldn\u2019t monetise the business through in-app purchases because Senegal didn\u2019t have an agreement with Google and Apple on taxation and revenue share, thereby limiting his revenue streams to only advertising.\n\nFinding a place to park in African cities can often be a hassle. Senegalese Lamine Ba of Parcsmart, explained to me that solving the problem of parking in Senegal and other African cities could lead to more efficient use of land and how parking can be a significant revenue stream for businesses.\n\nYanick Kemayou of Kabakoo Academies (Mali), whose edtech solution is helping youths acquire critical competencies such as programming and design, for success in a fast-moving world, was generous in explaining his business model and later helping me get a city transport card to aid my movement around the city.\n\nI also chatted with Singaporean-French serial entrepreneur and now investor, Lin Dejean Yun of Transcendence VC, who explained why she\u2019s bullish on francophone Africa: it\u2019s an untapped market.\n\nOn different occasions, I listened to a pitch by Lew Kam of Easy Matatu (Uganda)\u2014one of the 3 finalists in the Climate Tech Awards\u2014on how they are reducing carbon emissions by streamlining mobility.\n\nDr Rasha Rady of Chefaa (Egypt) spoke about learning to pitch to investors as a female founder on a panel session about women in tech.\n\nCameroonian tech founder and investor, Rebecca Enonchong, gave a passionate talk on her struggles as an entrepreneur and why African entrepreneurs are better adapted to surmount new challenges.\n\n\u201cStartups in Africa, in my opinion, are less risky than startups in other parts of the world because of our resilience as entrepreneurs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe [African entrepreneurs] are very adapted for challenges, and we\u2019re able to surmount challenges unlike any other ecosystem entrepreneurs that I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Here\u2019s a 2-minute clip of her speech.\n\nI also listened to a panel on the future of work. Gregoire Schwebig, CEO AfricaWorks, suggested that maybe Africa doesn\u2019t need to rely on Western ideas of going fully remote due to its current infrastructural problems. The future he suggested is in distributed offices: rather than having one office, companies could have offices all-around cities, closer to employees. The idea rings nice to me, but I wonder how affordable it is.\n\nSince it was launched in 2018, the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019Entreprenariat Rapide des Femmes et des Jeunes (DER) has granted 60 billion FCFA (~$96,424,000) out to startups and helped transform the Senegalese tech ecosystem. Mame Aby Seye, General Delegate for Youth and Women Entrepreneurship, spoke about the achievements of the Senegalese tech ecosystem and the support given by the DER to make this possible.\n\nFood\n\nAfter eating shawarma on my first day in Paris, I had more sandwiches, croissants, and pizza over the next 2 days, and then I started craving Nigerian food\u2014I was tired of meals with flour. Fortunately, I ate sea bass, Turkish food, which made my taste buds come alive.\n\nOn Friday evening, I got to eat some Nigerian fried rice cooked by a Nigerian friend who was also at the conference.\n\nOutside African tech\n\nIndia was recognised as Country of the Year at VivaTech, a special recognition given due to the contribution of Indian startups to the world. India has 100 unicorns\u2014one out of every 10 unicorns comes from India.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, and other notable innovators and leaders were also present at the conference.\n\nFour years ago, Huawei launched its app gallery to the rest of the world, making a concerted effort to move beyond Google and build its own ecosystem of products that tie together. During a session by Huawei, the company shared that it has over 432 billion downloads and over 580 million monthly average users (MAU), as of 2021\u2014and that less than 10% of those came from Europe. The number of users from Africa wasn\u2019t shared, most likely because the session was more relevant to a European audience. The Huawei operating system has 5.4 million registered developers and over 187,000 apps are already integrated into it.\n\nThat\u2019s a small figure compared to Google, which had 3.48 million apps on Playstore as of Q1 2021, and 111.3 billion apps downloaded as of 2022. But still, it is a sign that Huawei has made progress over the years. The company also displayed some of its machine learning capabilities. Here\u2019s a video of a demonstration of that.\n\nFashion and tech\n\nAmid the 2,000 exhibitors at the conference, I learned that fashion and beauty brands like Fendi, Bulgari, and Dior were doing more than just creating outfits in the metaverse. Bulgari had an interactive display that enabled clients to create a 3D image of a piece of jewellery in the metaverse, which can then be minted into an NFT. Christian Dior partnered with Lucibel, a French company that designs and manufactures new-generation lighting products and solutions based on LED technology, to create this mask that uses cold red light to stimulate and regenerate skin cells within 12 minutes, without the risk of burning. I didn\u2019t get to try it, but someone who did mentioned that it\u2019s like a substitute for Botox, given that it tightens the skin and straightens out wrinkles.\n\nFendi teamed up with a startup to create an interactive game that gave users the ability to recreate a limited edition bag in order to experience how it was created by craftsmen in Italy. It took 900 hours to create one bag.\n\nSome of these demonstrations were a strategy to get the attention of passers-by, and others were meant to build affinity with the brand by asking users to create fashion items virtually.\n\nLa fin\n\nSaturday, May 18 was the hottest day of the year so far in France, and I felt every degree of it. Many people stayed indoors, and those who went outside were dressed lightly. At its peak, temperatures rose to about 32\u00b0C\u2014Lagos was 26\u00b0C. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how the heat from Lagos followed me to Paris.\n\nSaturday was mostly dedicated to conference sessions held in French\u2014most sessions without translators, presenting me with the perfect opportunity to visit more booths and meet more people.\n\nLater in the evening, after 4 days of learning about tech and showcasing tech products and services, VivaTech 2022 came to an end with music from French DJ Hadrien Federiconi, better known by his stage name Feder. The Africa Tech section hosted ace Congolese guitarist Olivier Tshimanga, who dished out some melodic tunes. The Congolese delegates sure do know how to end a conference in style.\n\nVivaTech 2022 recorded about 91,000 in-person visitors and 300,000 online visits from 146 countries. There were 1,800 startups and 700 investment funds.\n\nAfter an exhilarating week, the next day, I made sure to visit the Eiffel Tower before leaving Paris.\n\nAs I got closer, I didn\u2019t find the Eiffel Tower impressive, seeing that it was one tall structure made up of connected metals. But as soon as I made it to the top, my opinion changed; the experience was beautiful.\n\nAu revoir, mes amis!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abeg\u2019s future lies in its rebrand to a social commerce platform",
          "text": "Payment app, Abeg, has rebranded and will now be called PocketApp, a move that underlines its transition from a payment app to a social commerce app. In addition, Abeg, a subsidiary of Piggytech Global Limited, secured approval-in-principle (AIP) for a mobile money operator (MMO) license application from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to expand the scope of its social commerce operations across the country.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Dare Adekoya, Muheez Akanni, Patricia Adoga and Eniola Ajayi-Bembe as a platform that allows users, mostly Gen Z, to send and request money through a wallet-based system, it enjoyed some virality on Twitter due to its catchy name\u2014derived from a Nigerian slag used to ask for favours. It got downloaded 5,000 times in its first 2 weeks. However, it didn\u2019t gain massive prominence until it became headline sponsor of Big Brother Nigeria (BBN), the most-watched reality TV show in Africa, in 2021. Abeg was acquired by Piggytech Global just before the show began airing, and while it entered the show with 20,000 users on its newly launched app, it claimed to have amassed almost 2 million users by the time the show ended. But after blitzscaling to millions of users in a couple of months, its success was trailed by questions about whether it could retain those users.\n\nPiggytech Global co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Joshua Chibueze told TechCabal that PocketApp is the answer to that question. \u201cSo, what we did last year was to get everyone to get the app first. It was very successful, we got over a million users. But this time around, we are going for retention, we\u2019re trying to create a brand or an app that everyone can use. But for now, we\u2019re targeting small micro-businesses and people who sell on Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nPocketApp will support seamless payments and online commerce throughout the country by adding new functionalities for users to buy and sell items via virtual Pocket shops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty much focused on people being able to open a pocket shop and sell online for free. Over 65% of Piggvest\u2019s current users sell something, it made sense for us because we\u2019re trying to create extra value for our current customers,\u201d Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp has expressed interest in tapping into Nigeria\u2019s social commerce market which is estimated to reach US$23.8 billion by 2028.\n\nThe MMO license will allow the PocketApp to issue e-money, create and manage wallet creation, enable USSD, recruit, manage and pay money to its agent, and manage pool accounts\u2014all of which are central to expanding social commerce.\n\nPocketApp, like MTN and Airtel, who have received similar approvals-in-principle in the past year, also voiced its support to the Nigerian government\u2019s goals for financial inclusion. \u201cPocketApp affirms its commitment to the financial inclusion agenda of the CBN and the Federal Republic of Nigeria and will continue to make it easier for our teeming young population to seamlessly carry out their transactions while saving them costs and giving them more access to get paid,\u201d it said in a statement sent to TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp COO, Patricia Adoga, said that the PocketApp infrastructure has been in the works for over 18 months to enable secure social commerce because social commerce thrives better in a more trusted environment. \u201cSo we added escrow to our payment infrastructure, protecting buyers and sellers and many other features, ensuring a smooth shopping experience on the app,\u201d Adoga said in a statement.\n\nThe company said in a statement that as a full social commerce app, it will connect buyers and sellers across Nigeria, and soon, other African countries. \u201cPeople can discover you from anywhere, as long as you do honest work and you have a smartphone,\u201c Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nChibueze explains that PocketApp hopes to break through geographical limitations and connect sellers and buyers in different parts of the country. \u201cA strawberry trader in Lagos can buy strawberries from a vendor in Jos who has a pocket shop. That way, the price will be way cheaper because you\u2019re dealing with the vendor directly,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Nigeria where e-commerce is nascent and people are more comfortable with buying goods physically, e-commerce companies have to build trust with their users. He explains that trust is one of PocketApp\u2019s major offerings. \u201cSo what we\u2019ve solved for commerce is trust. Anybody can sell anything online in the safest way possible. And anybody can sign in now with confidence. Because if you pay for an item, and you\u2019ve not gotten what you want, you\u2019ve got to deliver whatever it is, and always ask for your money back.\u201d\n\nCommenting on PocketApp\u2019s approval-in-principle, co-founder and COO of Piggytech Global, Odunayo Eweniyi, said in the aforementioned statement, \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly pleased that PocketApp has been granted an approval-in-principle as a Mobile Money Operator in Nigeria. We will now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the full operating license, enabling us to continue growing and expanding the scope of our social payments, social commerce and other digital financial products to reach millions of Nigerian micro-entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "The high yields on Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds is making it impractical for the government to raise fresh dollar debt, effectively shutting Africa\u2019s second largest oil producer out of the international capital market.\n\nThe country\u2019s latest $1.25 billion bond, which is due in 2029 and was issued at a yield of 8.375 percent barely four months ago in March, now has a yield of 13.57 percent. That\u2019s as of Tuesday, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThe bond is also trading at a discount of 22.5 percent, given that the price has fallen from 100 cents to 77.5 cents to a dollar. This implies that an investor who bought the bond when it was issued has lost 22.5 percent of their money.\n\nOnly Tunisia, El-Salvador, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras and Kenya Eurobonds have sold off at a faster clip among peer countries this year.\n\n\u201cWe are effectively locked out of the Eurobond market for new issues,\u201d a source familiar with the matter said. \u201cIf we must issue, it will be priced at 12 to 14 percent interest, (that\u2019s) junk bond rates at best.\u201d\n\nThe yields on existing bonds are usually an indicator of how much it will cost to raise a new Eurobond.\n\nThe rising yields on government Eurobonds also affects corporates, as the sovereign yield serves as a base for corporates.\n\nThis implies that if it will cost Nigeria 14 percent to issue a new Eurobond, any company that wants to raise dollar debt will now pay at least 15 percent.\n\nRead also: For first time, investors dump Nigeria Eurobonds despite oil rally\n\nWhy are Nigerian bonds selling off?\n\nNigeria\u2019s fiscal woes, notably a growing petrol subsidy bill and lower oil production, which have blunted the gains of an over $100 oil price, have negatively impacted investor sentiment and triggered the bond sell-off.\n\nThe World Bank predicts the country\u2019s oil revenues, the major source of dollar earnings, will fall in 2022 despite higher oil prices.\n\nNigeria recently called off plans to sell Eurobonds this year due to the fear of being priced out of a deal by investors who now treat existing Nigerian notes like junk despite a B- credit rating that is superior to that of Ghana, for instance, which is CCC+.\n\nA junk bond like the Ghanaian bond offers higher yields than conventional bonds due to the high risk of default associated with them. Ghana, which has a debt to GDP ratio of over 80 percent, obtained the junk status due to liquidity challenges.\n\n\u201cI was considering buying the dip in April, when the price of a particular Nigerian bond had collapsed to 80 cents per dollar because the sell-off looked excessive for a country that has never defaulted and has a debt to GDP ratio of 40 percent,\u201d one investor said.\n\n\u201cI hesitated; now I feel I dodged a bullet, going by today\u2019s price and it\u2019s unclear when a rebound will happen, with next year\u2019s elections adding another layer of risk,\u201d the investor said.\n\nImplication of not being able to sell Eurobond\n\nFor Nigeria, which has binged on debt since a collapse in oil prices in 2016, being shut out of the international capital market could prove very costly. The country\u2019s debt stock has more than tripled from N12 trillion at the beginning of 2016 to N40 trillion at the end of 2021.\n\nThe external debt component has gone from $10 billion to $38 billion in that period, with Eurobonds accounting for 37 percent at $14 billion at the end of 2021, according to data from the Debt Management Office.\n\nNigeria has also often tapped the Eurobond market to ease frequent dollar crunch in the economy, and an inability to do that now would mean a weaker exchange rate and higher inflation.\n\nThe country may have to resort to tapping the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to fill the gap that will arise from an inability to tap the international capital market until conditions improve.\n\nSome analysts are, however, of the view that the conditions that come with an IMF loan may prevent Nigeria from tapping the Washington-based lender, especially with the upcoming elections.",

Ghana, which has a debt to GDP ratio of over 80 percent, obtained the junk status due to liquidity challenges.\n\n\u201cI was considering buying the dip in April, when the price of a particular Nigerian bond had collapsed to 80 cents per dollar because the sell-off looked excessive for a country that has never defaulted and has a debt to GDP ratio of 40 percent,\u201d one investor said.\n\n\u201cI hesitated; now I feel I dodged a bullet, going by today\u2019s price and it\u2019s unclear when a rebound will happen, with next year\u2019s elections adding another layer of risk,\u201d the investor said.\n\nImplication of not being able to sell Eurobond\n\nFor Nigeria, which has binged on debt since a collapse in oil prices in 2016, being shut out of the international capital market could prove very costly. The country\u2019s debt stock has more than tripled from N12 trillion at the beginning of 2016 to N40 trillion at the end of 2021.\n\nThe external debt component has gone from $10 billion to $38 billion in that period, with Eurobonds accounting for 37 percent at $14 billion at the end of 2021, according to data from the Debt Management Office.\n\nNigeria has also often tapped the Eurobond market to ease frequent dollar crunch in the economy, and an inability to do that now would mean a weaker exchange rate and higher inflation.\n\nThe country may have to resort to tapping the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to fill the gap that will arise from an inability to tap the international capital market until conditions improve.\n\nSome analysts are, however, of the view that the conditions that come with an IMF loan may prevent Nigeria from tapping the Washington-based lender, especially with the upcoming elections.",
          "summary": "The high yields on Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds is making it impractical for the government to raise fresh dollar debt, effectively shutting Africa\u2019s second largest oil producer out of the international capital market.\nThis implies that if it will cost Nigeria 14 percent to issue a new Eurobond, any company that wants to raise dollar debt will now pay at least 15 percent.\nRead also: For first time, investors dump Nigeria Eurobonds despite oil rallyWhy are Nigerian bonds selling off?\nA junk bond like the Ghanaian bond offers higher yields than conventional bonds due to the high risk of default associated with them.\nGhana, which has a debt to GDP ratio of over 80 percent, obtained the junk status due to liquidity challenges.",

          "text": "Nigeria flared natural gas worth over $13.3bn (N4 trillion) within the last 10 years, BusinessDay analysis show, volumes that could have helped dent demand shortage in Europe and meet critical power needs at home.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2021, the country flared 3.8 billion standard cubic feet (scf) both onshore and offshore, according to the Nigerian gas flare tracker of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA).\n\nThe total value of the gas flared over a decade is valued at $13.3 billion by NOSDRA but converting this into naira at the prevailing exchange rate over the course of 10 years puts the cumulative value at N4 trillion, according to BusinessDay calculations using the average exchange rate in each year.\n\nRanked seventh on the World Bank index, Nigeria has been able to cut flares by 31 percent between 2012 and 2021, but flare intensity increased by 10 percent in the same period.\n\nThe country\u2019s inability to commence the gas flare commercialisation programme approved by the government in 2016 is said to be limiting efforts to end flaring.\n\nThe Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP) is an ambitious plan to sell over 700 million scf of gas a day flared at 178 different sites.\n\nThe NGFCP was established to achieve the government target of eliminating gas flaring in the Niger Delta by 2020. The Petroleum Act of 1969 and Flare Gas (Prevention of Waste and Pollution) Regulations 2018, signed in July 2018, provide the basis for the NGFCP.\n\nBased on the right of the Federal Government under the Petroleum Act, the NGFCP was designed to offer a series of auction rounds, wherein the Federal Government takes the flare gas at the flare sites, and auctions it to third parties for commercialisation.\n\nThe programme has, however, stalled after 203 bidders emerged and little else has been heard about it after the Petroleum Industry Act established a new regulator to take over the sector.\n\nHowever, other African countries are harnessing their gas potentials. In April, Italy signed a gas supply deal with Algeria. The agreement will see Italy ramp up gas imports from Algeria by around 40 percent in its first major deal to find alternative supplies following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNigeria, whose proven reserve grew to 209 trillion cubic feet in January 2022, can leverage gas to grow its economy and meet critical needs outside the country.\n\nCollins Obi, an energy specialist, said with the ban on Russian gas by the West, energy security is a front-burner across European countries with the increasing focus on Africa as a major strategic gas supplier.\n\n\u201cThus, Nigeria needs to position itself for the economic growth opportunity this presents,\u201d he said.\n\nOreoluwa Owolabi, corporate intelligence lead at GAS360, said the value of gas flaring in Nigeria indicates riches in energy resources but poor energy management and supply.\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in infrastructure to distribute the gas to where it would be commercially viable. This could be for export or pipelines across the country for electricity generation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt requires a government-led effort, and the government has already taken some steps towards stopping flaring by 2030.\u201d\n\nHe said that the international communities are now accepting gas as a necessary fuel.\n\n\u201cThis can be used to accelerate Africa\u2019s net-zero transition and there would be more funds available for gas projects, which can partially finance our infrastructure development,\u201d Owolabi added.\n\nObi commended the Nigerian government on its work to promote gas-to-power initiatives.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that the government promotes gas-to-power initiatives, and the approval of the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) natural gas pipeline construction remains commendable,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to NOSDRA, Nigeria flared an estimated 14 million tonnes of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere contributing to global warming.\n\nThe World Bank, in its gas flaring satellite data from 2020, reveals that Russia, Iraq, Iran, the United States, Algeria, Venezuela, and Nigeria remain the top seven gas flaring countries for nine years running since the first satellite was launched in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe practice results in a range of pollutants released into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, methane, and black carbon (soot). The methane emissions from gas flaring contribute significantly to global warming in the short to medium term, because methane is over 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide on a 20-year basis,\u201d the World Bank said.",

Christopher Odia, in Ikabigbo, Etsako West Local Government Area of the State.\n\nShaibu, who led other government functionaries and heads of security agencies in the state, on Monday, to Ikabigbo, called for calm among residents in the community.\n\nThe acting governor also commiserated with the Head of Ikabigbo Community, Aleghe Braimah; family of a member of the Edo Vigilante Network who lost his life in an attempt to rescue the priest, Yusuf Nurudeen, and the Ogieneni of Uzairue, Kadiri Omogbai.\n\nShaibu said he was in the area to commiserate with the Uzairue people and get first-hand knowledge of the incident, noting, \u201cThe unfortunate attack resulted in the killing of Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia at St. Michael Catholic Church, Ikabigbo in Etsako West Local Government Area.

We also commend the police and the military for their prompt action. We\u2019re very saddened that we lost our loved ones.\n\n\u201cI insisted that we must come to see what has happened for ourselves. We have gotten some information already.

          "text": "The past five years have shown us how fragile democracy can be, not only in Nigeria but around the world. We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.\n\nDemocracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.\n\n\u2013 Margee M. Ensign",

          "text": "Lamido Yuguda, director general of Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), has said that unclaimed dividends by Nigerians rose to N180 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\nHe disclosed at an interactive session with editors on Tuesday, noting that the commission is working to ensure it reduces the level of unclaimed dividends to zero per cent.\n\n\u201cThis continues to be an important area of concern for the commission and we have been engaged in tackling it in the capital market,\u201d noted the SEC director-general.\n\nAlthough N180 billion unclaimed dividends is a huge amount of funds, Mr Yuguda said the amount constituted only five per cent of the quantum of dividends declared in the capital market.\n\n\u201cThat is a large amount. But when you compare that with the total amount of dividends declared in the Nigerian capital market, these unclaimed dividends amount to about five per cent of the total amount of dividends declared,\u201d Mr Yuguda pointed out. \u201cAlthough, five per cent is still not the ideal number, it should be zero per cent. Every person, who has come to the capital market and invested money, should be able to get his dividends as and when due.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the SEC is working with the Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) and other stakeholders in the industry to address the issue of unclaimed dividends.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been working with CSCS, registrars and the stockbrokers to make sure that every market appraisal makes it easy for the clients to fill their mandate form. We are also making sure that investors continue to get their dividends,\u201d Mr Yuguda explained.\n\nThe SEC chief mentioned that the federal government intervened last year by enacting a finance act on unclaimed dividends\u2019 funds.\n\n\u201cThe government is looking at unclaimed monies both in the capital market and the banking system and established a fund that will actually access through dividends that have been unclaimed for a certain number of years that meet certain basic definitions,\u201d Mr Yuguda explained.\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is not that the government has taken over the money, but when the claimants eventually surface, there is a system for recovering. Every person who has come to the capital market and invested money should be able to get his dividends as and when due.\u201d",

Then he starts dropping the projects one after the other. See everyone turning around to acknowledge his good works and apologise. Cold and calculative guy,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nOn his part, a tweep identified as Ogbeni Taofiki went further to declare that the Kogi state governor performed better than four sitting governors of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nHe insisted that it would be hypocritical if Bello is mentioned in the same sentence with some non performing governors.\n\n\u201cMedia is powerful! Yahaya Bello is telling his own story the way he wants it told. Sincere people now know you can\u2019t mention Yahaya Bello in the same sentence with Governors without projects. 1 Yahaya Bello is now = 4 PDP Governors.,\u201d he claimed.\n\nMaskUpNigeria on his part believes many critics of the governor would be surprised with the level of his achievement in Kogi. According to him, people did not get to know of Bello\u2019s successes because the governor did not invest in media coverage.\n\n\u201cSadly, Yahaya Bello did not invest in media coverage. His achievements have surprised so many of his critics. Imagine Presidential Material did all these projects being posted on social media. Just imagine it. White Lion.\u201d he said.\n\nAnother Nigerian social media user, Afolayan T N, simply declared that he should now be regarded as a fan of Governor Bello.\n\nMeanwhile, another tweep, Iyalaya @lollylarry1, lamented that the impression given about the governor was quite the opposite of the reality on ground.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m seeing so many projects by Governor Yahaya Bello, but the initial impression of him we had on this app was that he was not doing anything in Kogi state. I\u2019m glad we are wrong.\u201d\n\nOn his part, JJB @Chuks_jj, simply apologised to the governor. he said he was wrong to have placed the governor besides others. He added that Governor Bello is way ahead of other governors.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) would sustain the hearing and healing process that it started to ensure fairness, justice and oneness before the 2023 general elections.\n\nIn an audience with some APC senators Tuesday in Abuja on the outcome of the party primaries and its implications, the President noted that complaints were received by some members, and machinery had been put in place by the National Working Committee (NWC) to address their various concerns.\n\nOf recent, the APC fortune dwindled in the Senate over gradual loss of the party\u2019s majority after losing seven senators to the opposition parties.\n\nTension also heightened over rumoured bid of 18 other senators to defect to other political parties as a demonstration of the lawmakers\u2019 angst over the conduct of the party primaries.\n\nBuhari\u2019s plea\n\nPleading with the aggrieved lawmakers, however, President Buhari assured them that justice would be done to all.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with our ethos, therefore, I shall continue to address the ensuing challenges and grievances through the party machinery while paying keen attention to the outcomes.\n\n\u201cI must also remind you of the primacy of justice in all our actions. If justice is denied, the outcome is usually unpleasant.\n\n\u201cThis is because you are the members who keep the party running. I should add that as part of the policy of using the party machinery for effective resolution of conflict, the Chairman and some members of the National Working Committee visited the National Assembly recently to dialogue with our legislators.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party is currently addressing the outcomes as part of the way forward. I am encouraging all the party functionaries to adhere to the truth and to be fair to all parties in any dispute,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told the APC senators that the strength and victory of the party in the election would depend on unity of members and ability to prevent injustices or heal them, perceived or real.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of the party, one of my primary roles is to ensure that our culture of internal democracy and dispute resolution is strengthened by creating the opportunity for members to ventilate their opinions, views and grievances at different levels.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that we have accomplished 23 years of uninterrupted democratic governance, our journey is still in a nascent stage and we continue to learn from our challenges and mistakes. Similarly, our party is still evolving in its culture and practices and it is my expectation and hope that we shall attain a mature level in our internal conduct,\u201d Buhari further said.\n\nThe President urged party members to exercise restraint and continue to demonstrate commitment to the ideals, while the leadership continues to build and develop the APC and the country.\n\n\u201cI have noted your grievances particularly as it concerns the just concluded processes, the cost to the nation, the threat to the majority position held by our party in the legislative chambers and likely consequent cost to the electoral fortunes of our party as we approach the general elections. We must not allow these dire threats to come to pass.\n\n\u201cI must acknowledge that in every contest, there must be a level playing ground just as there would be grievances at the end. That is the test of our democratic credentials, systems and practices. I have since the conclusion of the processes been inundated with various reports and complaints,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President assured that \u201cjustice shall prevail, aggrieved members shall be assuaged and the interest of the party and the nation shall be protected.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe thanked the senators for suggesting a meeting on the issues, which include the future of the party and pursuing solutions to the challenges thrown up by the recent election related activities, particularly, the primaries.\n\nSenators\u2019 angst\n\nIn his remarks, leader of the delegation and Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, said at least 22 senators and members of the party were unhappy with the outcome of the primaries in their states, stressing that they felt disenfranchised by the process.\n\nHe said the legislators had made sacrifices for the growth of the party and democracy in the country, asking for the President\u2019s kind intervention.\n\n\u201cMr. President, in the Senate we have worked hard and consistently sold your programmes beyond party lines. Be assured always of our support,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSpeaking further on the outcome of the meeting through a signed statement, Senator Kalu said the aggrieved lawmakers would no longer pursue defection from the APC.\n\n\u201cEarlier this afternoon, I led the 22 aggrieved senators and members of the All Progressive Congress to President Muhammad Buhari, GCFR.\n\n\u201cOur meeting with Mr. President was successful and the issue of decamping from our party has been laid to rest,\u201d he said.\n\nUzodinma on Tinubu\u2019s certificate\n\nMeanwhile, Imo state Governor Hope Uzodinma has said there was no need for the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to make fresh submission of his credentials if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) record keeping was efficient and its server functional.\n\nThe governor said this Tuesday in Abuja while fielding questions from State House correspondents after a thank-you-visit to President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the hosting of Army Day celebration in Owerri.\n\n\u201cFor my presidential candidate, the issue of certificates shouldn\u2019t even arise. In 1999, he contested elections and became the governor of Lagos; in 2003 he contested election as second term governor of Lagos.\n\n\u201cHe ran and won as a senator in the country. Where record keeping is efficient, and INEC server is functional, he doesn\u2019t need to do fresh submission.\n\n\u201cHowever, if whatever he is supposed to submit is not handy, it is not late yet. I\u2019m sure before the time he will submit whatever is required of him,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the hosting of the 2022 Nigerian Army Day celebration, the governor said the event would help address the security challenges in the state.\n\n\u201cBasically, I came to see the President to thank him for his gracious approval for Army Day celebrations to be held in Owerri, Imo state, South-East of the country.\n\n\u201cThat of course you know will help strengthen the measures that are already on ground to curtail the effects and excesses of banditry and insecurity in the region.\n\n\u201cSo for me, it is a good thing and for the people of Imo state, we are indeed very delighted over that. Basically, that is why I am here and the President is also very comfortable with the visit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor called on bandits and trouble makers in the state to surrender or be dealt with.\n\n\u201cOnly two days ago, I called on the criminal gangs operating in any part of Imo state; the unknown gunmen, bandits who are hiding one way or the other in our forests and the bush to come out.\n\n\u201cI granted a 10-day period during which if they laid down their arms, we will grant them pardon. As of this morning, I am told that some people are already surrendering their arms and it is a good development,\u201d the governor said.\n\nCommenting on the general security in the South-East, he said all the governors in the region were working in synergy to address the problem.\n\nHe said the sit-at-home order issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was not effective in Imo state.\n\nUzodinma said: \u201cWe the governors in the South-East are all working to ensure that security is guaranteed, for people to go about their businesses. The sit at home order is not operational in Imo State neither is it working in Owerri, the state capital.\n\n\u201cReally, it is still in operation in some parts of the South-East but the governors are also working in synergy to ensure that it becomes a thing of the past,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the recent call by the Governor of Zamfara state, Bello Matawalle, on the citizens of the state to acquire guns for self-protection, the Imo State Governor said there was no need for such.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Imo is not the same with that in Imo State. However, on the Governor\u2019s call for individuals to apply for licenses, I think the authorities will only give licenses to a qualified and a legible candidate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a need for individuals or unauthorized people to carry arms. The situation in Imo state is currently being managed and we have seen relative peace for the past weeks in Imo and normal businesses have incrementally resumed in Imo State.\n\n\u201cI am not in Zamfara state to know the s there but I don\u2019t think that the security situation in Zamfara state or any other part of the country is beyond our security agencies. In Imo State, the security agencies have risen to the occasion, they are working in synergy and the situation has been controlled to a barest minimum.\u201d\n\nThe governor also condemned recent attacks and the kidnapping of some clergymen.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, of recent, some Catholic Priests became victims of the banditry saga in Nigeria. It is an unfortunate and condemnable. It is not as if other people being killed are not important but we detest any form of violence or taking of lives.\n\n\u201cThe Church condemns that and Islam is also against that, likewise our local traditions and I am calling on security agencies to do everything humanly possible to fish out those who are behind this and bring them to book,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc. has called on Civil Servants to be dedicated to duty for improved productivity.\n\nAdegbite made the call during the celebration organized by the ministry to commemorate the 2022 African Public Service Day in Abuja.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction working with staff of the ministry due to their commitment to duty which he stressed should be sustained to take the ministry to enviable heights.\n\nDelivering her speech at the ceremony, Permanent Secretary, of the Ministry, Dr Oluwatoyin Akinlade, revealed that efforts were on to ensure that the ministry blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation.\n\nAkinlade who hailed the passion of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, HCSF, Folashade Mejabi Yemi-Esan, for improved productivity and welfare of civil servants, said the theme of the day, \u201cPerformance Management System, PMS: Impact on productivity in the Nigeria Public Sector\u201d was most apt as it summarises the vision of the HCSF to make the service a world class system that drives optimum productivity through effective and efficient performance management.\n\n\u201cShe has vigorously pursued the full implementation of the new Performance Management System through training of various categories of officers. This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that the party\u2019s leadership will sustain the hearing and healing process it started to ensure fairness, justice, and oneness before the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe gave the assurance on Tuesday in Abuja at a meeting with some APC senators on the outcome of the party\u2019s primaries and their implications.\n\nThe President noted the complaints received by some members, saying machinery had been put in place by the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) to address their various concerns.\n\nHe, however, urged party members to exercise restraint and continue to demonstrate commitment to the ideals while the leadership continues to build and develop the APC and the country.\n\n\u201cI have noted your grievances, particularly as it concerns the just concluded processes, the cost to the nation, the threat to the majority position held by our party in the legislative chambers, and likely consequent cost to the electoral fortunes of our party as we approach the general elections,\u201d the President was quoted in a statement by his media adviser, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cWe must not allow these dire threats to come to pass. I must acknowledge that in every contest, there must be a level playing ground just as there would be grievances at the end. That is the test of our democratic credentials, systems, and practices. I have since the conclusion of the processes been inundated with various reports and complaints.\u201d\n\nPrevent Injustices\n\nPresident Buhari promised the lawmakers that justice would prevail, and aggrieved members would be assuaged, adding that the interest of the party and the nation would be protected.\n\nIn keeping with the party\u2019s ethos, he vowed to continue to address the ensuing challenges and grievances through the APC machinery while paying keen attention to the outcomes.\n\n\u201cI must also remind you of the primacy of justice in all our actions. If justice is denied, the outcome is usually unpleasant,\u201d the President told the senators. \u201cThis is because you are the members who keep the party running.\n\n\u201cI should add that as part of the policy of using the party machinery for effective resolution of conflict, the Chairman and some members of the National Working Committee visited the National Assembly recently to dialogue with our legislators.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party is currently addressing the outcomes as part of the way forward. I am encouraging all the party functionaries to adhere to the truth and to be fair to all parties in any dispute.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also informed the APC senators that the strength and victory of the party in the election would depend on the unity of members and the ability to prevent injustices or heal them, whether perceived or real.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs the leader of the party, one of my primary roles is to ensure that our culture of internal democracy and dispute resolution is strengthened by creating the opportunity for members to ventilate their opinions, views, and grievances at different levels.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that we have accomplished 23 years of uninterrupted democratic governance, our journey is still in a nascent stage, and we continue to learn from our challenges and mistakes. Similarly, our party is still evolving in its culture and practices, and it is my expectation and hope that we shall attain a mature level in our internal conduct.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President thanked the senators for suggesting a meeting on the issues, which include the future of the party and pursuing solutions to the challenges thrown up by the recent election-related activities, particularly, the primaries.\n\nIn his remarks, the leader of the delegation and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Kalu, said at least 22 senators and members of the party were unhappy with the outcome of the primaries in their states, noting that they felt disenfranchised by the process.\n\nHe explained that the legislators had made sacrifices for the growth of the party and democracy in the country and asked for the President\u2019s kind intervention.\n\n\u201cMr President, in the Senate, we have worked hard and consistently sold your programmes beyond party lines. Be assured always of our support,\u201d said Kalu.",
          "summary": "He gave the assurance on Tuesday in Abuja at a meeting with some APC senators on the outcome of the party\u2019s primaries and their implications.\nThe President noted the complaints received by some members, saying machinery had been put in place by the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) to address their various concerns.\nHe, however, urged party members to exercise restraint and continue to demonstrate commitment to the ideals while the leadership continues to build and develop the APC and the country.\nIf justice is denied, the outcome is usually unpleasant,\u201d the President told the senators.\n\u201cMr President, in the Senate, we have worked hard and consistently sold your programmes beyond party lines.",

I must state here that this document has undergone wide consultation with relevant technical stakeholders within the legal and health service context in the state.\u201d\n\nOgboye explained that the process to develop the guidelines commenced in 2018 with the Safe Engage project led by the ministry and hosted by the Society for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Nigeria (SOGON), with support from the Population Reference Bureau (PRB).\n\nHe added that stakeholders in the health sector worked with key opinion leaders in Lagos and the south-west region to develop a tailored advocacy tool for terminations within the legal context.\n\nThe permanent secretary pointed out that the advocacy messages on the Safe Engage project focused on two immediate outcomes, including ensuring that safe abortion services were available within legal indications in Lagos and domesticating the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, supporting women to terminate a pregnancy caused by rape or incest.\n\n\u201cTo guide the implementation, one of the follow-up recommendations of the project was the adaptation of the National Standards and Guidelines for Safe Termination of Pregnancy within Legal Indications within the Lagos State context,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health had developed and disseminated the national guidelines on safe termination of pregnancy which highlights the compendium of conditions and circumstances under which termination of pregnancy could be instituted.\n\n\u201cThe guideline was intended to build the capacity of health professionals to identify pregnancies for which legal termination could be instituted.\u201d\n\nOthers who spoke at the event include the Country Director of Marie Stopes International Organisation Nigeria (MSION), Emmanuel Ajah; the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Medical Sciences, Otukpo, Professor Innocent Ujah; and a Professor of Law at the University of Lagos, Ayodele Atsenuwa.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, met with 22 angry senators of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in an attempt to stop their planned defection. The meeting was held at the Council Chambers of State House, Abuja.\n\nThe affected senators included Smart Adeyemi, Frank Ibezim, Danladi Sankara, and Ibrahim Oloriegbe. They were led to the meeting by Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor-Kalu.\n\nThe president noted the concerns of the senators, who failed to secure the party\u2019s return ticket to the Red Chamber. He said their exit would affect the future of the ruling party, saying, however, that he praised the senators\u2019 effort to find a solution.\n\nThe president assured them that as the leader of the party, part of his role was to create the environment for members to ventilate their grievances.\n\nEmphasising that there must be a winner and loser in any contest, Buhari revealed that he had been inundated with complaints over the primaries, assuring that he would continue to address the challenges through the party machinery.\n\nUrging party members to exercise restraint, as justice would be done, the president told the senators, \u201cI thank you for the decision to approach me with your concerns over the future of the party and for pursuing solutions approach for the challenges thrown up by the recent election-related activities particularly, the primaries.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of the party, one of my primary role is to ensure that our culture of internal democracy and dispute resolution is strengthened by creating the opportunity for members to ventilate their opinions, views and grievances at different levels.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that we have accomplished 23 years of an uninterrupted democratic governance, our journey is still in a nascent stage and we continue to learn from our challenges and mistakes.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, our party is still evolving in its culture and practice and it is my expectation and hope that we should attain a mature level in our internal conduct.\n\n\u201cI have noted your grievances, particularly, as it concerns the just concluded processes, the cost to the nation, the threat to the majority position held by our party in the legislative chambers, and likely consequent causes to the electoral fortunes of the party as we approach the general election. We must not allow these dire threats to come to pass.\n\n\u201cI must acknowledge that in every contest, there must be a level-playing ground, just as there would be grievances at the end. That is the test of our democratic credentials, systems and practices.\n\n\u201cI have since the conclusion of the process been inundated with various reports and complaints. In keeping with our ethos, therefore, I shall continue to address the ensuing challenges and grievances through the party machinery while paying keen attention to the outcomes.\n\n\u201cI must also remind you of the primacy of justice in all our actions. If justice is denied, its outcome is usually unpleasant. This is because you, the members, keep the party running.\n\n\u201cI should add that as part of the policy of using the party machinery for effective resolutions of conflict, the chairman and some members of the National Working Committee visited the National Assembly recently to dialogue with our legislators.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party is currently addressing the outcomes as part of the way forward. I am encouraging all the party functionaries to adhere to the truth and to be fair to all parties in any dispute. This is important because our strength and victory in the election lies in the unity of the party and our ability to prevent or heal any injustice perceived unfair.\n\n\u201cI urge you and all party members to exercise restraint and continue to demonstrate commitment to the ideals while we continue to build and develop the party and the country.\n\n\u201cFinally, Let me assure you that justice shall prevail, aggrieved members shall be assuaged in the interest of the party and the nation shall be protected.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and Senate Chief Whip, Kalu, said at least 22 senators and members of the party were unhappy with the outcome of the primaries in their states, noting that they felt disenfranchised by the process.\n\nHe said the legislators had made sacrifices for the growth of the party and democracy in the country, and asked for the president\u2019s intervention.\n\nResponding, Kalu stated, \u201cMr President, in the Senate, we have worked hard and consistently sold your programmes beyond party lines. Be assured always of our support.\u201d\n\nIn a statement after the meeting, Kalu said the lawmakers told Buhari that they were disenfranchised by the process of the primary and that Buhari urged them to exercise restraint and change their decision to defect from the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe aggrieved senators would no longer pursue their defection plans from the APC. Our meeting with Mr President was successful and the issue of defection from our party has been laid to rest.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than six APC senators, including the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, had dumped the party, citing poor internal politics during its recent primary elections.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja",

          "title": "Like Tinubu, APC\u2019s Vice Presidential Placeholder, Masari, Declares Certificates Missing",
          "text": "In a strange coincidence, documents submitted by the vice presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Ibrahim Masari, to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have revealed that the placeholder vice presidential candidate, like the principal candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu, could not also produce requisite certificates to back his stated academic qualifications.\n\nBut Imo State Governor Hope Uzodinma said the certificate debate around his party\u2019s presidential duo was of little or no importance, stressing that Tinubu\u2019s past electoral records would suffice.\n\nHowever, the Action Alliance (AA) asked a Federal High Court to restrain INEC from including APC and its candidates on the ballot for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn an effort to meet the deadline for the submission of nomination forms of presidential candidates for next year\u2019s election, Tinubu, who won the presidential ticket of APC, had announced Masari as his running mate. But there were plans to substitute him within the substitution window in the electoral guidelines.\n\nMasari is a Muslim from Katsina State in the North-west geopolitical zone, where the current president, Muhammadu Buhari, hails from.\n\nThe choice of Vice President has become a tough one for Tinubu, following the strong division in the country along religious and ethnic lines. He said recently at the 60th birthday ceremony of Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, that he was still searching for a substantive partner, provided Masari voluntarily resigned in line with the new electoral laws.\n\nHowever, the Form EC9 bearing Masari\u2019s particulars revealed that he did not attach any certificate in support of his educational qualifications. Masari, rather, attached a sworn affidavit claiming the loss of vital documents, including his school certificates.\n\nAccording to the court document sighted, Masari claimed to have lost his certificates alongside other documents last July in Abuja.\n\nThe sworn affidavit deposed to at the Supreme Court, Abuja, read in part, \u201cThat sometime in January 2021, while on transit within Wuse Area, FCT-Abuja, I discovered that my original Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) of Plot, No. KT 17522, GRA, Katsina, Katsina State; Certificate of Kaduna State Development Centre from 1994 \u2013 1995; Grade ll Certificate from Katsina Teachers\u2019 College (KTC) from 1978-1983 and First Leaving School Certificate, issued by Masari Primary, Katsina State, from 1972-1978, got lost.\u201d\n\nMasari added that all efforts to trace the documents proved abortive, hence, the affidavit.\n\nTinubu\u2019s Form EC9 published by INEC last Friday, which revealed that the APC presidential candidate did not fill the column for his primary and secondary school education, had generated a lot of controversy, with some political parties and groups threatening to go to court. The felt the APC presidential candidate could not have left the two spaces blank after listing his primary and secondary schools, with dates attended, in his Form CF 001 for the governorship election in 1999 in Lagos State.\n\nBut Tinubu had explained that he could not explain the whereabouts of his certificates after soldiers invaded his house while he was in self-exile during the fight against military regime in the country, post-June 12, 1993 presidential election annulment.\n\nUzondinma: Tinubu\u2019s Certificate Saga a Non-issue\n\nImo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, said those pushing the certificate saga against the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, were merely trying to create an issue out of a non-issue.\n\nUzodinma said Tinubu, having contested in three different elections in the past, did not need to make fresh submissions if the record keeping system of the electoral body was efficient.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell, all the things so mentioned are entirely party challenges that will be resolved. But, for my presidential candidate, the issue of a certificate shouldn\u2019t even arise. In 1999, he contested elections and became the governor of Lagos, and in 2003, he contested the election for second-term governor of Lagos.\n\n\u201cHe ran and won as a senator in the country. Where record-keeping is efficient, and INEC server functional, he doesn\u2019t need to do a fresh submission. However, if whatever he is supposed to submit is not handy, it is not late yet. I\u2019m sure before that time, he will submit whatever is required of him.\u201d\n\nUzodinma also dismissed speculations that APC was on the verge of losing its majority status in the National Assembly over the looming defection of their lawmakers.\n\nHe stated, \u201cDid some leave the party or are leaving the party? Until they leave. But for those few, who left, of course, there are some others, who left other parties and joined the APC. So, one cancels the other.\u201d\n\nOn allegations levelled against him by his political adviser that he was running a closed government, the governor said, \u201cYou know, politics and leadership is a business that thrives on ideology. Sometimes, you hire aides, who by our primary assessment, you think would be able to fit into the ideology and your vision for your people.\n\n\u201cSo, if the way things are going, to the best of their idiosyncrasies, is not consistent with the thought process, it means that they are licensed to try their luck in another place.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had paid the N27 million he was said to owe his former aide, Uzodinma said, \u201cSo, this aide, who accused his boss of non-inclusiveness. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not running a limited liability company, where shareholders must all vie for\u2026\n\n\u201cI accepted his resignation and I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavours and that brings the matter to a close. I don\u2019t know how I will owe N27 million to an aide; you are talking about my political adviser, I don\u2019t know what he sold to me that I bought?\u201d\n\nAppraising the security situation in his state, Uzodinma said bandits had started laying down their arms and surrendering to the authorities.\n\nThe governor, who spoke with newsmen on Tuesday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at State House, Abuja, said the ultimatum he gave armed gangs to lay down their arms had started yielding fruit.\n\nHe said, \u201cOnly two days ago, I have already called on the criminal gangs in Imo State, the unknown gunmen and bandits, who are hiding in one way or the other, forests and in the bushes to come out and I granted a 10-day period, during which if they come out and lay down their arms, we will grant them pardon.\n\n\u201cAs at this morning, I\u2019m told that some people are already surrendering their arms. It is good a development, because we have to attack the situation from all fronts and ensure that innocent citizens are not molested.\u201d\n\nUzodinma, however, maintained that the security situation in his state had not degenerated to the level of individuals carrying arms. He said, although he was not in Zamfara State, where Governor Bello Matawalle ordered self-help, and could not say exactly why the government was making the move, his own administration was in control of the security situation in Imo State.\n\nUzodinma said the security situation in the state had greatly improved and there would not be any need for individuals to carry arms as a form of self-defence.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m not in Zamfara State to know what exactly is the situation. However, I don\u2019t think that the security situation is beyond our security services.\n\n\u201cIn Imo State, the security agencies have risen to the occasion and we\u2019re in charge of the security and, like I told you earlier, the agencies are working in synergy and the situation has been controlled to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cCurrently, businesses have resumed and people are going about their day-to-day businesses without any molestation. So I think that we\u2019re all working in one accord to ensure that, nationally, the security situation has improved.\u201d\n\nAction Alliance Asks Court to Restrain INEC from Listing APC, Tinubu for 2023 Presidential Poll\n\nThe Action Alliance (AA) filed a case at a Federal High Court seeking to restrain INEC from including APC on the ballot for the 2023 presidential election. AA also asked the court for an order restraining the electoral umpire from accepting the name of Senator Bola Tinubu as candidate of APC in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\nThe plaintiff, in the Writ of Summon, marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/954/2022, predicated its request on the claim that both APC and Tinubu were not qualified to participate in the 2023 presidential election because of alleged forgery committed by Tinubu in 1999.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of the plaintiff by its lawyer, Mr Upkai Ukairo, claimed that Tinubu forged his University of Chicago certificate he submitted in 1999 in aid of his qualification for the 1999 governorship election in Lagos State, which he won.\n\nThe suit, dated and filed June 21, had INEC, APC, and Tinubu as first, second, and third defendants, respectively.\n\nIn a 16-paragraph statement on oath deposed to by one Kalu Agu, the plaintiff submitted, \u201cThe third defendant is a person, who is not qualified for election to the office of President of Nigeria on the grounds of alleged forgery.\u201d\n\nAccording to the deponent, the third defendant provided false information and attached forged documents in the Form CF 001 he submitted to INEC in 1999 in aid of his qualification for the governorship poll.\n\nAgu stated that the claim by Tinubu that he possessed BSc degrees in Economics and Business Administration from the University of Chicago and Chicago State University in 1976 and 1979, respectively, were false.\n\n\u201cThe third defendant knew he did not possess all the educational qualifications he listed in the said INEC form,\u201d Agu added.\n\nThe deponent further claimed that the matter of false information by Tinubu was once reported to the Inspector General of Police and the Lagos State House of Assembly, wherein the latter set up a committee, which in its report on Page Two, stated , \u201cThe governor of Lagos State stated his evidence by admitting full responsibility for some of the needless errors being pinpointed in recent publications and which formed the basis of the allegations against him.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff contended that, arising from the above, the third defendant was not qualified for election into the office of President of Nigeria, and, therefore, prayed the court to declare that the third defendant\u2019s claim that he attended Government College, Ibadan, and University of Chicago in his INEC Form CF 001 in 1999, which he presented to INEC, was false.\n\nHe also urged the court to further declare that the alleged false information on Tinubu\u2019s INEC Form CF 001 about his BSc degree in Economics from the University of Chicago \u201cis a forged certificate\u201d.\n\nThe plaintiff said in view of Section 137(1)(j) of the 1999 Constitution, the court should declare that the third defendant, \u201cHaving in 1999 presented a forged certificate to INEC, is not qualified to contest for the office of president.\u201d\n\nHe sought, \u201cA declaration that by virtue of Sections 224, 23 and 24 of the 1999 Constitution and the Constitution of the APC, the office of the President of Nigeria is to be occupied by a man of integrity and impeccable character.\u201d\n\nWhile the plaintiff prayed the court for an order of perpetual injunction restraining INEC from publishing the name of Tinubu as candidate of the APC in the 2023 presidential election, AA prayed for another order of perpetual injunction restraining INEC from listing APC as a political party on the ballot for the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja",

          "text": "The Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, Tuesday lamented that none of the government-owned refineries are presently working, even as he revealed that there were over 200 illegal refineries being operated across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari, has lamented that none of the government-owned refineries are presently working, even as he revealed that there are over 200 illegal refineries being operated across the country.\n\nThe GMD made this known when he appeared before the House of Representatives Joint Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) investigating the increase in prices of diesel and cooking gas.\n\nAddressing the Committee chaired by Hon. Abdullahi Gaya, the GMD said though the situation was regrettable, the NNPC was doing something to bring the refineries back to work.\n\nWhile noting that a good number of illegal refineries had been taken out, he said the company was in the process of doing a quick fix on the Warri refinery.\n\nOn petroleum supply, the GMD stated that no one could guarantee the security of petroleum supply, as countries are preserving excess volume that they have in their kitty.\n\nKyari blamed the current energy crises on the Ukraine and Russia war which resulted in the increase of petroleum product.\n\nHe said the solution was to restore crude oil production, and for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to create more dollars, adding that there was a massive intervention that was ongoing to see if the issue would be resolved by the end of July.\n\nHe explained, \u201cCommunity members are not the thieves, absolutely not. Everything we are doing is to incorporate the communities into the process of protecting these assets.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly in its wisdom also included Trust Fund for the communities in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) so that they become parts and parcel of the system. Criminals in the Niger Delta come from all parts of the country. At these illegal refineries there are people from all works of life there.\n\n\u201cMany of these people are completely armed and the community members cannot even report them, they are helpless because if they report them, they will come after them.\n\n\u201cMy suggestion this moment is deliver supply, make sure oil marketers are also able to import, and there\u2019s need to engage the CBN to create more dollars, once we do these, dollars will be allocated for the import of AGO, the will also dampen the effects of going to buy dollar in the open market.\n\n\u201cSo you can have cheaper dollar and definitely it will affect the price. Secondly, the regulatory institutions, the authority, Consumer Protection Council and NNPC, I suggest we need to sit jointly to see how arbitrage can be managed so that the end user is not completely exploited.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Kyari ruled out the possibility of returning to the regime of subsidising diesel and LPG.\n\n\u201cToday countries are toying with subsidy because prices are so high because they don\u2019t think they can manage inflation associated with it,\u201d the GMD added\n\nOn his part, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed agreed with the GMD that the invasion of Ukraine by Russian contributed to the energy crises, due to fact that Russia is a major producer.\n\nAhmed also blamed supply disruption, the rise in the barrel of crude oil price to as high as $120 and the prevailing naira exchange rate for the energy crisis in the country.\n\nHe opined that the availability of adequate foreign exchange at official rate of N410 to the dollar and the revitalisation of the nation refineries remained the panacea to the energy crisis in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cit is important to stress that the country has no control over the price of AGO or any other petroleum products at the international market.\n\n\u201cHowever, countries all over the world are making various efforts at easing the present global high crude oil prices on domestic petroleum products prices. The following are recommended initiatives to address the current high prices of AGO and LPG in the country.\n\n\u201cRequired amount of FX for importation of the petroleum products be made available to the genuine importers at CBN official rate; encourage establishment of more local refineries and LPG processing facilities to meet domestic demands, and increase LPG supply from major domestic producers including NLNG, BRT processing, CNL LPG FSO. Consequent upon the foregoing, an extensive consultation is required amongst key Stakeholders, towards lessening the present tension being generated by the global high oil prices.\u201d\n\nIn their presentations, some of the oil marketers appealed to the lawmakers to urge the CBN to make FX available to them, in order to make the importation of petrol into the country competitive, reduce the rising cost of the product, and stop the overdependence on NNPC.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Gaya noted that Nigerian has refining capacity but because none of the refineries were functioning was what placed the country in its sorry state.\n\nHe said there was need to find solution to the high cost of diesel and cooking gas in a bid to cushion the effect on the generality of Nigerians.",

          "title": "Two Years After, NUPRC Closes Out 2020 Marginal Oilfields Bid Round",
          "text": "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) on Tuesday finally closed out the 2020 marginal oilfields bid round two years after the process commenced.\n\nWith the issuance of the Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL), the winners of the awarded oilfields can now move to site for preliminary prospecting activities. In the process of getting to conclude the bid rounds, the NUPRC stated that about N200 billion was raked in from the 57 oilfields to the coffers of the federal government, plus an additional $7 million in signature bonuses and others.\n\nIn addition, the NUPRC announced the unveiling of the Template and Procedure Guide for the Host Communities\u2019 Development Trust (HCDT) for commencement of implementation of the provisions of Section 235 of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\nThe unveiling of the template on host communities fund administration was a major development for oil-producing areas of the Niger Delta who are expected to benefit from the three per cent operating expenses of oil companies in the area.\n\nSection 235 of the PIA provides for the incorporation of Host Communities Development Trust by the Settlors, that is, the oil and gas companies, for the benefit of their hosts. It places the responsibility to set up the HCDT and appoint the Board of Trustees (BoT) on the companies in consultation with the host communities.\n\nIn addition, Section 247 of the Act requires the BoT to set up a management committee to handle the general administration of the fund.\n\nThe HCDT provided by the PIA proposes to advance the development of the host communities within the scope of funds available to the BoTs for such purposes. It is also envisaged that sabotage of oil and gas infrastructure will be reduced since local communities now have a slice of the pie.\n\nSince the regulations, which were officially unveiled by the government are now ready, the managers of the fund should be announced anytime soon.\n\nDescribing the ceremony as a giant milestone for the current administration, Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, who spoke during the event, noted that about 70 per cent of the entire bid winners had fully paid up.\n\nHe recalled that the roadmap of the marginal field awards began with two fields awarded in 1999, adding that prior to the award, 13 fields had been awarded on land, eight fields in swamp and nine fields offshore, leading to a cumulative of 30 marginal fields so far awarded in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note to state here that this present award process saw 57 fields offered and over 70 per cent of them have their signature bonuses fully paid. This indeed is a testament to the increasing interest in our petroleum operations,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the implementation of the PIA 2021 in top gear, the minister reminded the new awardees that their assets would be fully governed by the provisions of the new law.\n\n\u201cAs a result, each successful field will be issued a Petroleum Prospecting Licence (PPL) in line with the PIA. This is a complete departure from what used to be where the marginal field owners had no licences.\n\n\u201cThis marks the beginning of a new era for us in the oil and gas sector and I urge the awardees of the PPL to take full advantage of the opportunities being presented to exploit, develop, and bring the assets to productive use,\u201d he declared.\n\nAs they move to develop their assets with the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), he urged the award winners to ensure that good oilfield practice was employed, while environmental considerations and community stakeholders\u2019 management should not be neglected.\n\nHe charged the commission to provide every necessary support to ease and facilitate seamless upstream petroleum operations in line with the objectives and provisions of the PIA.\n\nSome of the winners of the bid rounds included Matrix Energy, SunTrust Oil, PetroGas Energy, Genesis Hydrocarbons, Samora Oil & Gas, Ardova, Terra Energy and Mainland Energy.\n\nIt also included Energia, Bono, Calm Marine, Virgin Forest, Tempo, Deep Offshore, North Oil, Shepherd Oil, Hilltop Global, Duport, among others.\n\nThe process which commenced in 2020 had been bogged down by bureaucratic challenges, meaning that the actual drilling for oil had yet to effectively take off after a long time, although 161 companies were eventually shortlisted to advance to the final stage from 591 entities that applied for pre-qualification.\n\nThe then head of the defunct DPR, which has now transformed into the NUPRC, Sarki Auwalu, had said the exercise was worth roughly $500 million in signature bonuses.\n\nBut in his remarks at the event, the Chief Executive of the NUPRC, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, noted that the commission was faced with several constraints during the course of the exercise which have now been surmounted.\n\nHe listed some of them as the COVID-19 interruption, partial payment of signature bonuses by some of the awardees, and the unwillingness of co-awardees to work together in forming SPVs for field development.\n\nKomolafe explained that historically, the marginal fields award initiative began in 1999 and was borne out of the need to entrench the indigenisation policy of government in the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry and build local content capacity.\n\nBesides, the initiative was also targeted at creating employment opportunities and encouraging increased capital inflow to the sector.\n\n\u201cAgain, it is noteworthy that the 2020 marginal field bid round exercise in respect of which PPLs are being issued today has attracted government revenue of about N200 billion and $7 million respectively,\u201d he stressed.\n\nHe noted that the NUPRC would continue to provide a predictable and enabling regulatory environment to operators in line with its technical and commercial statutory mandates with a view to optimising the development and exploitation of the nation\u2019s hydrocarbon resources.\n\nKomolafe lamented that Nigeria currently wasn\u2019t meeting its oil production quota, stating that it was the reason Nigeria wasn\u2019t feeling the positive impact of the current surge in crude prices.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note that the average price of crude oil in recent months has been above $100 per barrel. This upward swing in market fundamentals is largely associated with the Russian-Ukraine conflict.\n\n\u201cHowever, the impact of the upswing in the crude oil price is not reflecting in the nation\u2019s revenue earnings due to disruptions in our national oil production owing to sabotage, theft, and other operational challenges.\n\n\u201cTherefore, potential licensees are urged to take advantage of the current market realities and quickly bring their fields to production,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, the NUPRC head announced the unveiling of the Template and Procedure Guide for the Host Communities Development Trust for commencement of implementation of the provisions of Section 235 of the PIA, 2021.\n\nHe said the commission was committed to transparency in its processes and has therefore, implemented the Beneficial Ownership (BO) reporting, which requires full disclosure of ownership information.\n\n\u201cThe objective is to ensure financial transparency, accountability, and public financial management among others,\u201d Komolafe stated.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event, a former Chairman of the Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN) and an oilfield winner, Bank-Anthony Okoroafor, described the awards as the most transparent process in the history of marginal fields awards in the country, adding that the issue of \u201cforced marriage\u201d has now been resolved.\n\nHe noted that the IOCs should fully cooperate with the winners by giving them assess for evacuation of crude as far as it was optimal and avail them all the information needed to make it easier to transition to first oil.\n\nOkoroafor urged the federal government to solve the issue of crude theft and vandalism as well as declare it a national emergency.",
