          "title": "Travel ban: Nigeria, UK may clash, FG alleges action discriminatory",
          "text": "\u2022 Britain\u2019s decision based on discrimination, not scientific but prejudice, claims FG\n\n\u2022 Presidential steering committee will respond appropriately soon, says Mohammed\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s a temporary precautionary measure to prevent further Omicron cases in UK \u2013 Envoy\n\nThe United Kingdom on Monday justified its travel ban on Nigeria, saying the measure was a temporary measure aimed at protecting its public health.\n\nThe Head of Communications, British High Commission, Dean Hurlock, stated this in response to inquiries from The PUNCH on Monday evening, just at the Federal Government said the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 would respond to the travel ban.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who said this at a press conference in Abuja on Monday, described the travel ban as discriminatory.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to the UK, Alhaji Sharafa Ishola, described the travel ban as apartheid.\n\nBritain had on Saturday banned Nigerian travellers after it said it discovered 21 cases of the Omicron variant in people who recently visited Nigeria.\n\nLast week, Canada banned Nigerian travellers after the detection of the variant in persons who visited Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 programme on Sunday, faulted the ban, saying it would hurt livelihoods.\n\nBut the Head of Communications, British High Commission, Hurlock, said the UK was aware of the significant impact of the travel ban.\n\nHe also noted that the decision would affect people in both the UK and Nigeria, particularly at this time of the year, but stated that it was a precautionary measure meant to protect public health in England.\n\nHurlock, said, \u201cWe know that this decision will have a significant impact on people in both our countries, particularly at this time of year.\u201dThis decision is a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK, while we try to understand this new variant.\n\n\u201cThese are temporary measures that have been introduced to prevent further Omicron cases from entering the UK, and will be examined at a review point on December 20.\u201d\n\nThe commission stated that it would continue to work with the local authorities in tackling the pandemic.\n\nFG to respond to UK, Canada travel ban soon, says Lai Mohammed\n\nBut earlier on Monday, the Minister of Information and Culture, Mohammed, condemned travel bans by the UK, Canada, Indonesia, Hong Kong and others.\n\nThe minister, who is also a member of the steering committee, said, \u201cAs you are aware, Britain has put Nigeria on its red list and banned foreign travels from our country.\n\nThis is as a result of the discovery of COVID-19 cases, Omicron variant, in Nigeria. Britain now joins other countries, including Canada, which has taken a similar action against Nigeria over Omicron.\n\n\u201cLet me say straight away that it\u2019s up to the Presidential Steering Committee to respond to this action by the British government and others, and I have no doubt that the committee will respond appropriately.\u201d\n\nMohammed argued that the decision of Britain was based on discrimination and prejudice and not science because so far, no one had died of the Omicron strain.\n\nHe said it was obvious that many in the West were upset that their predictions on COVID-19 infections had failed to materialise.\n\nThe minister noted that many from the UK had also tested positive in Nigeria but Britain was not banned.\n\nHe also explained why Nigeria still received South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, and his entourage despite the country recording a large number of Omicron cases.\n\nHe said even the United Nations had faulted the recent travel bans, adding that it was nonsensical and nothing but travel apartheid.\n\n\u201cIf somebody who is a Nigerian but holds a British passport is allowed to enter Britain, he is as risky as I am. Is it the passport that now reduces his risk? That doesn\u2019t make sense. If my cousin who holds a British passport stays in my house and is going back, you allow him to come in but you say I can\u2019t?\u201d Mohammed asked.\n\nHe faulted claims that Nigeria deserved to be banned because 21 persons with history of travel to Nigeria had tested positive in the UK.\n\nThe minister wondered why other European countries were banned by the UK including those with Omicron cases.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the issue is how many people have tested positive or how many people Britain claims have tested positive. My position is very clear. Is travel ban the answer? The answer is no. Number one, where is the origin of this Omicron variant? It is definitely not Africa or Nigeria,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nThe minister argued that the travel ban was counterproductive and wondered why British citizens coming from Nigeria were still allowed in.\n\n\u201cHow do you slam this kind of discriminatory action on a country of 200 million people, just because of less than two dozen cases? Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned.\n\n\u201cThe two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travellers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive.\u201d\n\nHe said the vaccine apartheid whereby developed countries denied developing nations vaccines was what propelled COVID-19 mutations.\n\nMohammed maintained that developed nations must understand that until everyone is safe, no one is safe.\n\nIt is not about retaliation but what is best for our country \u2013 Mamora\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein, the Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, said the presidential committee would take a decision soon.\u2019\n\nWhen asked if Nigeria would retaliate, Mamora said it was not about retaliation but more of what would be in the best interest of Nigerians.\n\nThe minister, however, faulted the UK and others for banning travellers from Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is not about retaliation but what is best for our country. The PSC will take a decision on the matter soon but it will be in the best interest of our country. Even the United Nations described the act as travel apartheid. That is exactly what it is,\u201d Mamora said.\n\nTravel ban over Omicron variant apartheid \u2013 Nigeria high commissioner to UK\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s high commissioner to the UK , Ishola, described the travel restrictions imposed on the country as \u201capartheid\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on a BBC radio programme on Monday, Ishola said the ban on Nigeria was \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d\n\nThe high commissioner said what was expected of the UK was a global approach and not a selective measure, adding that most Omicron cases in Nigeria came from elsewhere through travellers.\n\nIn a related development, British Airways on Monday informed travel agents in Nigeria about the restriction of flights from Nigeria to the UK following the ban.\n\nIt disclosed this in a notice, titled, \u201cRestrictions for travel from Nigeria to the UK,\u201d which was sent to travel agents of the international carrier that operate in Nigeria.\n\nThis came as it was gathered in Abuja on Monday that most passengers of the airline stayed away from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, due to the restrictions by the carrier and the ban on Nigeria by the UK government.\n\nThe notice by British Airways to travel agents read in part, \u201cAs a result of the UK government placing Nigeria on to the red list, we continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust our schedule accordingly.\n\n\u201cAll flights from Lagos to London Heathrow have been re-timed. This is due to restrictions at London Heathrow to support arrivals from a red-list country.\n\n\u201cAll customers travelling from Nigeria must follow the UK government\u2019s rules on arrivals from a red-list country and have a negative PCR test result within the 48 hours prior to their departure from Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cOnly British or Irish nationals or customers who have residence rights in the UK will be allowed to enter the UK, where they will be required to quarantine in a government facility.\u201d\n\nThe airline further explained that arrivals from Nigeria would land at Heathrow Terminal 5 where any customer whose journey terminates, would be taken on a bus to Terminal 4 for processing.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The management of the National Assembly has said the Federal Government\u2019s order that all civil servants must be vaccinated before accessing their offices cannot be implemented at the legislative complex.\n\nThis is just as safety protocols have been relaxed at the National Assembly.\n\nThe Director of Information, Mr Rawlings Agada, who spoke to our correspondent on the telephone on Monday, noted that restriction of access to the premises would cause chaos as workers were only a percentage of the population of the National Assembly \u201ccommunity.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 led by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, announced in October declared that civil servants without proof of vaccination and negative coronavirus tests would not be allowed to access government buildings from December 1, 2021.\n\nOur correspondent observed that workers have continued to gain unhindered access to the National Assembly.It was also observed that despite the outbreak of Omicron, the lawmakers have also shunned safety protocols.\n\nFor instance, before the National Assembly went on its annual two-month recess in July, facemasks wearing was made compulsory for persons entering the premises especially the chambers, committee rooms and offices.\n\nAlso, automatic hand sanitiser dispensers were mounted at strategic locations around the building.\n\nSome of these protocols have been shunned since the parliament resumed in September and especially during the budget defence sessions with ministries, departments and agencies on the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nA body sanitiser, which was meant to spray persons as they walk into the White House section, through it, has been removed.\n\nAgada, who said he is also a member of the steering committee on COVID-19, however, said the National Assembly complex housed not only Federal Government workers but also lawmakers, their constituents, private businesses and journalists.He partly said, \u201cThe National Assembly is one out of the federal institutions that commenced reopening earlier than others, to allow the legislators to go in. You will agree with me that the National Assembly, through the (political) leadership and the management, was proactive by setting up a steering committee.\u201c\n\nWe equally have a vaccination centre \u2013 not like the general ones. We have it here in the National Assembly, so the vaccination had commenced in the National Assembly over time and before that directive came.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is not like a strictly-civil service environment where you don\u2019t expect to have visitors coming in. This is a public institution and you know that in the last few weeks, even up till now, the budget (defence) sessions have been on and we have interactions from people of the civil society, private and public sectors as well as constituents and journalists.\n\n\u201cWe may have to subject over 300 journalists\u2026that you must show your vaccination card. You can imagine that kind of confusion that we will cause\u2026360 members (of the House of Representatives), 109 senators.\u201d\n\nAgada stated that the National Assembly had been proactive, with Tuesday and Thursday dedicated to vaccination of members of the community. \u201cWe have more than enough vaccines that are here. So, if you don\u2019t see us doing that (enforcement), know that the National Assembly \u2013 we are not just the staff \u2013 is a community of our own,\u201d he said.\n\nThe management\u2019s spokesman added, \u201cThe enforcement that you are looking for, if we do it that way, it is the same you people (journalists) that will run to press to say that the National Assembly stops people from coming in to defend budget and other things. But within the staff, we have been having vaccination going on and records are there for you to verify.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about apathy, should workers be allowed to decide on taking the jabs instead of enforcement of the order, Agada asked, \u201cHave you found time to look at the legality of the enforcement? Are you aware that those things are being challenged or not?\u201dHe added, \u201cWe are doing our bit without making it sensational.\u201d ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

It is about worldviews in international relations. Our dignity matters.

          "text": "A pro-democracy group, Take It Back,TIB, Monday, urged the Delta Women Affairs Commissioner to Conduct Child Assessment Procedure for All Children at Erhimu Secondary School Abraka, Ethiope-East Local Government Area.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by TIB Delta State Coordinator, Comrade Ighorhiowhunu Aghogho.\n\n\u201cBy this statement,we are through carefulness and thoughtfulness rebuking the unethical conduct of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education, Rose Ezewu of unlawfully administering over the unhealthy behaviors of children in both private and public schools without recourse to the Ministry for Women Affairs and Social Development legally known as the ministry in charge of children in the state,\u201d the stated said.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Delta State Police Command has declared wanted one Michael Ogbeife, an SS3 student of Erhimu Secondary School, Abraka in the State, for beating a teacher of the school, Joseph Ossai, to death.\n\nMichael was reported to be on the run after perpetrating the criminal act thereby causing the death of Joseph Ossai.\n\nIt was reported, the deceased teacher, who was said to be in charge of Agricultural Science and Biology in the school until his demise, had reportedly flogged Michael\u2019s younger sister, Miss Promise Ogbeife who was involved in a dispute with her classmate.\n\n\u201cWe reliably gathered that Michael had on that fateful day engaged the teacher in a brawl that resulted in the teacher giving up the ghost during the fight.\n\n\u201cMichael, who was reported to be exasperated and maddened by the teacher\u2019s decision to flog his sister and the angry SS3 student, resorted to a physical combat with the teacher.\n\n\u201cIt was reported that Michael angrily left the school\u2019s premises after his sister was flogged, and later returned back, heading straight to the staff room for a showdown with the teacher with the charm he initially rushed home to get before engaging the teacher in the fight.\n\n\u201cThe crux of the matter is that, whether from the tragedy publicized at Erhimu Secondary School Abraka, one can infer that the same or similar scenario occurs on a regular basis in both private and public secondary schools in Delta State? Or whether there are deviant children in both private and public schools of the State?\n\n\u201cDeviancy from a sociological perspective is a behavior that varies too wide from the average behaviors of the people of a given society. It described an action or behaviours that violates social norms, including former enacted rules(crime).\n\n\u201cIt is horrendous and appalling that Michael allegedly committed one of the most unspeakable crime in a school premises as a child and this did not move the Delta Basic and Secondary Commissioner, Rose Ezewu, to issue out a public statement condemning the act but rather she chose to remain silent on the face of a provocative evil.\n\n\u201cAt TIB, we are not surprised because the ministry of basic and secondary education in the state has been known to be producing and associating with all forms of negative characters at the detriment of children in the state.\n\n\u201cThe worst part of it is that the ministry of basic and secondary education has been meddling into schedules not legally meant for them. The operations of the ministry of basic and secondary education is limited to education of children only and not meddling into welfare of children in the state.\n\n\u201cThere are cases of children beyond both school and parental control being expelled from one school and getting admitted into another.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly asked, what right does the Ministry of basic and secondary education possess to expel children from school based on alleged deviant behavior without approval from the Ministry of women affairs?\n\n\u201cIt is our inference that the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education has constituted itself as the Police, Ministry in charge of children and the Family court in taking decisions on the welfare of children in the state.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, 28 suspected teenage cultists operating in some public secondary schools in Asaba, the Delta State Capital were arrested by the State Police Command.\n\n\u201cThe Delta State Police Commissioner, CP Zanna Ibrahim (as he then was) who disclosed the news said the teenage secret cult group known as the Future Trigger Boys, comprise of 28 suspects, out of which 10 were students from Osadenis Grammar School Asaba.\n\n\u201cThe suspected cultists, aged between 13 and 16years, were rounded up during school hours, following intelligence reports from members of the public,\u201d Zanna said.\n\n\u201cThese are children who were sent to school to study but regrettably, most of them were forcefully initiated into cultism under the supervision of the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education. The female children are not left out, as majority of them are now professional prostitutes while as children.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, there was anguish in Uvwie and Okpe local government areas of Delta State after it was discovered that several schoolgirls have been trafficked allegedly by a female member of a trafficking syndicate without the consent of their parents.\n\n\u201cPeculiar (surname withheld), a 15-year old senior secondary school student of Ugbomro Secondary School was among the 25 school girls who fell victims to the syndicate.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough, on these grounds, we hereby call on Flora Alantan, the Delta Women Affairs Commissioner representing the state government to apply to the Family Court of Delta State for a child assessment Order with respect to all the children at Erhimu Secondary School in order to avoid future occurrence of this tragedy.\u201d",

You would agree with me that the policy under Governor Emefiele over the last few years, has really emphasised on this, not only in terms of intervention funds given but in terms of some of the policies put in place, such as loan to deposit ratio (LDR) which when we instituted it in 2019 till now actually added about N7 trillion or so in loans, and which is quite unprecedented.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRead Also: Uganda may lose only international airport over Chinese loan\n\nConcerning the banking industry\u2019s stability, Mrs. Ahmad stated that all metrics and indications indicated that the banking system was strong, stable, and had aided Nigeria\u2019s recovery.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe\u2019re very positive about the resilience and the soundness of the banking sector. You see the reports as we give them from time to time from the MPC. Actually, the banking system has been very strategic in support of the recovery based on the impact of COVID.\n\n\u201cSome of the forbearances that we granted to the banking sector has helped to ensure they retain their capacity to lend and it has helped them give succor to their obligors and we are seeing some obligors come out of that forbearance now.\n\n\u201cThe financial soundness indicators have been very strong on capital, liquidity, and we\u2019re very proud and we just want to continue to ensure that the bank system continues to provide lending, not just wholesale or commercial lending but to small business because that will be the engine of the economy.\u201d\n\nShe also said that Africa, a diverse continent of 54 countries, boasting one of the youngest populations around the world and with thriving economies, rich with enormous and diverse talent, material, and natural resources should be well-positioned to deliver prosperity, create wealth and higher living standards for its over one billion citizens.\n\nMrs. Ahmed said: \u201cHowever, we are yet to fully realise and harness this potential. The problems and idiosyncratic challenges have been well documented.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding, there is significant room for our continent to leverage the bright spots, particularly the digital transformation and technology innovation being witnessed in the economy and financial ecosystem to foster more prosperity and reduce income inequality.\u201d",

Two people were also killed in that night.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe bandits had earlier demanded for N150million for the release of their victims, insisting that they (villagers) had farm enough this year to be able to pay the ransom, according to a source from the community.\n\nHowever source close to Zagzaga told Daily Sun on phone on Monday that the community contributed N5million and offered it to the bandits but was rejected, insisting that the community must pay N1million for each victim, including children.\n\n\u201cThe community contributed N5million which we offered to them, but they told us that the amount is too small. They said the only help they can offer to the community is for us to pay N1million for each person and we have over 55 people with them.\n\n\u201cThat is where we are at the moment, and they said they will not come down below that amount. We spoke to them last on Saturday morning\u201d.\n\nAccording to our source, \u201cthe community is helpless because since this incident happened, nobody has come to the community to even identify with us. We have been abandoned to our faith and that is why we have to negotiate with the bandits.\n\n\u201cWomen and children are in the bush under this harsh condition without food and enough water. The entire community is traumatized since this incident happened\u201d, he said.\n\nHe disclosed that no fewer than eight people, four women and four men have escaped from captivity in the last one week, and have relocated from the community.\n\n\u201cThey told us that people are suffering there because there is no food to eat and no water to drink. They said they managed to escaped because the bandits could not keep eyes on everybody due to the large number of those kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThey told us that there are over 100 people with the bandits in the bush, including other people kidnapped from other places. So the crowd is too much for them to manage and no food to give everybody\u201d, he said.\n\nZagzaga community has remained without security since April this year when the Military closed down it camp in the community after armed Bandits numbering about 70 invaded the camp and killed the RSM and injured others.\n\nThe Military camp was established since 2018 after incessant attack on the community by bandits.\n\nEver since the Military shot down it camp, there has never being any security presence in the area as the people continue to rely on God and the little help from the ill-equipped local vigilantes to provide security.\n\nAlthough the community has a police out post with two personnel, there is no accommodation for them to be used as office. They are also said to be ill-equipped.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "Earnipay is improving financial well-being for salaried employees",
          "text": "In Nigeria, wages for formal-sector employees are paid monthly; in the informal sector, however, this is paid daily. Now, when salaried employees go broke between paydays, they have three options: borrow, take a loan, or request a salary advance. But loans, most times, come with exploitative interest rates and salary advance schemes could plunge an employee deeper into debt.\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution, founded by Nonso Onwuzulike, allows employees flexible access to their accrued salaries on any day of the month.\n\nRevising the payday cycle\n\nIn 2019, Onwuzulike started a recycling company in Accra, Ghana, to reduce plastic waste and enable plastic recycling in the capital city. While running the business, he hired waste collectors and placed them on a monthly payment schedule. However, these employees\u2014all of them coming from informal-sector backgrounds\u2014were unhappy about this. They were used to being paid after a job was completed, or at the end of the workday. The monthly payment cycle left them cash-strapped and unable to match their daily expenses to their income. Consequently, once salaries were paid at the end of the month, many of the workers quit the company in search of other employment.\n\nEager to stem the high attrition rate among the waste collection staff, the company switched from a monthly payment schedule to a flexible one, allowing the workers to be paid more frequently\u2014weekly or bi-weekly. The change increased their productivity and fewer workers jumped ship.\n\nIt was a light-bulb moment for Onwuzulike. He went on to survey 100 formal employees within his network to find out how often they ran out of cash before payday and what their employers did to alleviate their financial difficulties.\n\nOnwuzulike\u2019s original intention for Earnipay was to build a salary advance solution\u2014in keeping with similar solutions already in existence in Nigeria, some of them powered by traditional banks. But plans changed when the results of the 100-person survey showed that 90% of salaried employees would rather have flexible access to their accrued salaries.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need payday loans or salary advances to fund their lives; they just wish to be paid more frequently,\u201d Onwuzulike said on a call with TechCabal.\n\nEarnipay is currently in beta, with Onwuzulike serving as CEO, Busayo Oyetunji COO, and Joshua Ajayi CTO. As Onwuzulike tells TechCabal, all three of them consider themselves co-builders of the product.\n\n\u201cWorks like an ATM\u201d\n\nEarnipay is unavailable to individual employees, so employers need to sign up and onboard their staff. The Earnipay app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month. Earnipay funds the withdrawal.\n\nFor example, if one dips into their salary on the ninth day of the month, it means they\u2019re entitled to half the amount they\u2019ve earned for working nine days. At the end of the month, their employer deducts from their salary the amount withdrawn, uses it to refund Earnipay for initially funding that withdrawal, then pays the employee the balance as their salary for the month.\n\nTransaction-fee tiers are attached to withdrawals. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 attracts a fee of \u20a6500, and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 attracts a \u20a61,000 fee.\n\n\u201cIt works just like an ATM,\u201d Oyetunji said.\n\nIntersecting the formal and informal workforce\n\nThe informal sector makes up about 80.8% of the workforce in urban Africa. In Nigeria where Earnipay operates out of, the sector makes up over 70% of the workforce.\n\nWhen Earnipay piloted three months ago, Onwuzulike envisaged that the solution would be useful only for low-income staff and informal employees, but the income profile of the app\u2019s users vary, Onwuzulike claims. \u201cOne of our customers earns a million naira a month,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, 17 companies have signed onto the app as active users and their employees have used Earnipay over 400 times.\n\nNo doubt, there are upsides to shorter payment cycles. For example, an employee can see their salary breakdown from day to day on the app, and unlike a loan or salary advance, which are borrowed funds, an Earnipay withdrawal is earned wages.\n\nStill, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up here as well. For instance, an earner who is unable to manage their personal finances may end up dipping into their salary before payday for the most frivolous reasons, and even after receiving their salary balance at month end, may still struggle to control their spending.\n\nResponding to these concerns, Oyetunji said, \u201cThe main issue here is, we\u2019re not financially educated. Whether you get your money at the end of the month or access it [daily] as you work, if you\u2019re not financially disciplined, Earnipay may not make a difference to your spending habits.\u201d\n\nScaling up\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Africa\u2019s formal and informal economies took hits. Six percent of formal workers were out of work in Malawi, and in Nigeria, that figure climbed to as high as 45%. Now, as Africa adjusts to the reset forced on the entire world by the pandemic, financial well-being across all employment sectors has become more important than ever. \u201cWe\u2019re in a financial health pandemic,\u201d Oyetunji said. \u201cQuality of life is reduced because people can\u2019t fund their everyday needs. How can our expenses be on-demand yet access to salaries earned isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe Earnipay team began building the product in July, received pre-seed funding of an undisclosed amount in August, and took their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to market in September.\n\nCommenting on Earnipay\u2019s plans for 2022, Onwuzulike said, \u201cOur goal is to partner with employers to improve employee financial well-being. We provide tools for income earners to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life. In addition to flexible salary access, we provide financial education to advise employees on best practices to manage their finances, and other products to assist them daily.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After expanding into financial services last year at the back of a $10 million investment from International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Partech, TradeDepot, a Nigerian B2B eCommerce platform, has now raised $110 million in an equity and debt Series B funding round.\n\nThe fund will support the delivery of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) services to 5 million SME retailers and drive further expansion of its merchant platform across the continent.\n\nIFC returned and led the equity round, with participation from Novastar, Sahel Capital, CDC Group, Endeavor Catalyst and existing investors, Partech and MSA Capital. The debt funding was led by Arcadia Funds.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTradeDepot started as a consulting firm in 2005 before pivoting into a product-led startup in 2016 to aid seamless milk distribution across Nigeria. Now, the platform is connecting consumer goods brands in Africa directly to a target market of several million retail outlets across the continent, and also providing micro-loans to retailers to enable them to buy more products.\n\nAccording to The World Bank, SMEs represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. In Africa, SME retailers generate $1 trillion in sales annually and contribute $2.6 trillion to the continent\u2019s nominal GDP. But these numbers are only a tiny representation of the sector\u2019s true potential and can\u2019t solve the problem of fragmented distribution networks and lack of access to financing.\n\nVia its ShopTopUp platform, TradeDepot is solving these two major problems, distributing needed goods to retailers and providing them with credit that allows them to stock their inventories and then pay as they sell the goods which have a repayment value of about 5% per month.\n\nTradeDepot has grown from over 40,000 merchants on its platform last year to more than 100,000 merchants. And it says this new funding will further expedite the delivery of its two unique offerings across its operating markets\u201410 cities in Nigeria including Lagos and Abuja, Accra in Ghana, and Johannesburg in South Africa.\n\nSpeaking about the new funding, Onyekachi Izukanne, CEO and co-founder of TradeDepot, said, \u201cWe remain super focused on making digital commerce and financing both accessible and affordable to neighbourhood retailers across key cities in Africa. We are delighted to be joined by an elite group of new investors and have IFC\u2019s Wale Ayeni and Brian Odhambo of Novastar joining our Board of Directors, to support us on this journey to drive growth and prosperity across the continent.\u201d\n\nA retailer navigating the ShopTopUp app\n\nIn 2021 alone, IFC committed a record $31.5 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of technology to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe informal sector is a large and critical part of Africa\u2019s economy, accounting for around 80% of jobs in the region,\u201d said Makhtar Diop, IFC\u2019s Managing Director. \u201cWe are excited to work with TradeDepot to leverage technology to help small businesses across the continent, particularly the many retailers led by women, access the resources they need to grow and scale.\u201d\n\nThe digitisation of SMEs continues to make headlines in Africa this year as startups in the sector like Nigerian Alerzo, Omnibiz, and Sabi have both raised big institutional funding to capture more market share. Similarly, in Northern Africa, Egypt-based Capiter and Appetito, and Morocco-based Chari are also scaling for more market share across the continent.\n\nIt\u2019s a large market, though, and there are still millions of informal businesses that predominantly function offline. But, as for TradeDepot, it wants to capture more than 5 million SMEs as it continues to leverage and expand its BNPL offering in the 12 cities it\u2019s currently operating in.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nThe payment for the shares on PrimaryOffer is facilitated by Flutterwave. In addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For most of these people, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a lethal blow, making it harder to access healthcare, in addition to the stigma some already face.\n\nOur Reporter, Bolu Abiodun, xrayed tech tools that could be game-changers for persons living with disabilities in Africa for this year\u2019s celebration.\n\nYou can read here: 4 tech innovations that can make life easy for physically challenged Africans\n\nOr if you\u2019d prefer audio-visuals, you can click this link\n\nInterestingly, on Friday, December 3, the Kenyan Bankers Association launched \u2018Deaf eLimu Banking\u2019, a Kenyan sign language self-training tool developed in partnership with Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD Kenya) and software engineering firm, Deaf eLimu Plus.\n\nA timeline of recent 5G events in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s changed since September 27, 2021, and Techpoint Digest No.176? That depends on what you count as a change.\n\nWell, in that newsletter, we brought you news of Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami\u2019s prediction of a January 2022 launch of the 5G network in the country.\n\nFar behind other countries like South Africa \u2014 probably on shaky ground \u2014 and Kenya, where some citizens already enjoy the 5G network, one wonders if a January 2022 date is still feasible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the first 5G tests held by telecoms giant, MTN in 2019, we\u2019ve seen house debates on health issues, a Memorandum of Understanding involving the C-Band Spectrum, and an auction committee set up.\n\nWhat do we know currently? After the Nigeria Communications Commissions (NCC) released a Draft Information Memorandum on the Spectrum auction in October 2021, a final document was presented on November 10. A deadline for bid submissions was set for November 24, 2021.\n\nAccording to the NCC, due to an Air Traffic Controllers strike, on November 23 that disrupted flights operations in Lagos, the deadline was moved to November 29, 2021.\n\nSome traction: On December 1, 2021, the NCC announced bids from three companies, MTN Nigeria, Airtel Networks Ltd, and Mafab Communications Ltd \u2014 a recently incorporated telecoms company licenced by the Commission.\n\nThe auction is set to take place on December 13, 2021.\n\nI have several questions: Why are Nigeria\u2019s other major telcos \u2014 read Glo and 9mobile \u2014 not on the list of approved bids? Did they apply? Would this auction hold in time? Is a January 2022 date still feasible?\n\nWith MTN Nigeria\u2019s recent share sales, continuing profits recorded by telcos operating in Nigeria, and a 5G auction coming up, 2022 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the telecommunications space in the country. That proverbial fly on the wall? You can bet that\u2019s me.\n\nNigeria-based Flex Finance raises pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlex Finance team.

Faustina Urassa, Programme Officer at the Kilimanjaro Association of Spinal Cord Injury (KASI), Tanzania, sees it as an opportunity to help others who have lost their ability to walk.\n\nUrassa trains people who have suffered from spinal cord injury how to use wheelchairs. Using a wheelchair herself, she says, \u201cif you have the appropriate wheelchair that meets your needs and suits you, you\u2019ll forget about your disability.\u201d\n\nFor young South African, Gift Moloke, living with disabilities means a difficult schooling process. Moloke, who has down syndrome, was rejected by several schools his mother applied to.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), 80 million people live with disabilities in Africa. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) puts the number of people living with disabilities at 300 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the numbers might be inaccurate, the story of Urassa and young Moloke are not the only ones on the continent. While it is already difficult to live with these disabilities, society makes it even more difficult.\n\nThe UN also affirms that most Africans living with disabilities are excluded from school and work opportunities.\n\nIn 1992, the UN proclaimed December 3 as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in a bid to \u201cpromote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights, and well-being of persons living with disabilities.\u201d\n\nFrom people living with learning disabilities to stuttering and being deaf, we have explored what living is like for people with disabilities and the role of technology in making life easier.\n\nNotably, Techpoint Africa has, at different times, covered tech tools that can ease life and work for people living with specific forms of disabilities like stuttering, deafness, Dyslexia, and Dyscalculia, among other learning disabilities.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of the Disabled, we are looking at four tech innovations that could help people living with disabilities globally.\n\nTactile watches for the visually impaired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEone Switch with additional rings Source: Oracle Time\n\nHyungsoo Kim, CEO, Eone timepieces, created the Eone when he realised that all watches and clocks rely heavily on vision.\n\n\u201cCould there be a way to cater for the blind?\u201d he thought to himself. Kim and his team went to work and came up with the Eone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eone allows users to check the time simply by touching and looking at it. Think of it as a regular watch, but it has balls instead of an hour and minute hand. One on the surface indicates the minute, and another on the side that shows the hour.\n\nEone stands for Everyone. Kim believes that products and services should be inclusive, and while his invention works well for the blind, people with vision can use it.\n\nRecalling when a group of visually impaired persons was testing the Eone, Kim was asked if the watch was made specifically for the blind.\n\n\u201cI said yes and expected a positive response, but they said, \u2018that\u2019s not what we want; what we want is what everyone else also likes.\u2019\u201d\n\nReturning the sense of touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsthetic arm\n\nWhile prosthetic limbs are nothing like the natural, they can give amputees something close.\n\nDr Luke Osborne, a researcher at John Hopkins University, Baltimore, US, wants to get prosthetic limbs even close to being natural with his invention, E-dermis.\n\nThe invention could return the sense of touch to prosthetic users. The tech works with a phenomenon known as phantom limb syndrome.\n\nAccording to Osborne, it is a \u201csensation where you\u2019ve lost a limb or part of a limb, but you can still feel it. The region of the brain that represents the limb is still there and still working to some extent.\u201d\n\nOsborne wants to tap into this sensation and help people who have lost a limb feel things they\u2019ve not been able to for a while.\n\nEliminating stigma with fashionable prosthetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBionic arm Source: CNET\n\nWhile Osborne is looking to return the sense of touch to prosthetic limbs, a group of video game enthusiasts is working on making it life-like.\n\nA video game company and a company that develops bionic arms \u2014 DEUS Ex Universe and Open Bionics \u2014 came together to create prosthetics that are more than just medical devices.\n\nOpen Bionics Co-founder, Joel Gibbard says, \u201cwhat we are trying to do is change the prosthetics industry so we can offer affordable, functional, and beautiful prosthetic devices to amputees.\u201d\n\nLooking like something out of a video game, Andre Vu, Executive Brand Director of DEUS Ex Universe, says they wanted the device to be something people wore fashionably.\n\nOpen Bionics has made a semi-functional prototype of these fashionable bionic arms and hopes to perfect the useability.\n\nTranslating sign language into speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUni demo. Source: the Daily Mail\n\nUni, a device created by MotionSavvy, converts sign language into text or speech, making it possible for deaf people to communicate effectively.\n\nIn a demo by Alexandr Opalka, MotionSavvy CTO, the device read his hand and converted it into speech.\n\nUsing sensors with dual cameras, it detects the movement of joints in the hands and fingers and interprets them into speech.\n\nWhile assistive technology is great, most of them are pretty expensive and inaccessible to many people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to the UN, 200 million people globally need assistive tech for low vision and over 400 million require products that assist hearing.\n\nWhile the high price tag of these devices contributes to their inaccessibility, they are often not included in welfare schemes, making them even more expensive in high-income countries.\n\nMore attention needs to be paid to assistive tech but, more importantly, persons with disabilities.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology? Did Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s story inspire you? Then, we\u2019d love to hear your story. Kindly reach out to me (emmanuel@techpoint.africa) or my colleague, Oluwanifemi (oluwanifemi@techpoint.africa).

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government is closely monitoring the market for an additional $2.18bn Eurobond issue after the September 2021 successful deal described as one of the biggest financial trades to come from Africa this year.\n\nThe amount will make up the $6.18bn external borrowing, already appropriated in the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cFor the external borrowing, which is about $6.18bn, we raised $4bn in September. For the remaining $2.18bn, we are working with the transaction advisers and monitoring the market.\n\n\u201cIf we think the market is good and our supervisors say we should raise that money, we will. But our options are on the table for the external borrowing,\u201d Patience Oniha, Director General, Debt Management Office (DMO) said Monday.\n\nShe was speaking on the sideline of a Workshop organized by the Debt Office for The Secretariats of The Senate Committee on Local & Foreign Debts and House Committee on Aids Loans & Debt Management in Niger State.\n\n\u201cWe did have what you will call demand, which is the same thing as an order book or subscription of over $12bn, but the advisers said to us, let\u2019s drop the interest rate a bit and see how much we get. Also, the $6bn at once is huge, since there\u2019s a secondary market where they are traded.\n\nRead Also: FG to roll out 5G network, China Declares Cryptocurrency Transactions Illegal, Nigeria Sells $4bn Eurobond\n\n\u201cWe dropped the rate a bit and we still had demand of over $9 billion. We think that $4bn was a good size to issue at once so that it does not become such a surplus in the market that the price will not be very good both for the sovereign and for other borrowers,\u201d Oniha explained.\n\nAs contained in the 2021 Fiscal Framework, the Federal Government projected N8.12 trillion total revenue to fund the 14.57 trillion aggregate expenditure \u2013 inclusive of the supplementary budget. Consequently, the fiscal deficit, projected at N6.45 trillion, or 4.52 percent of GDP, is expected to be financed mainly by domestic and external borrowings.\n\nOniha said the government has so far raised about 90 percent for the domestic component, with plans to raise between N200b and N250bn through sukuk in the next two weeks.\n\n\u201cOut of the N3.145 trillion domestic borrowing for this year from both the appropriation Act and the supplementary, we have raised about N2.8 trillion, remaining is about N350bn.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do a sukuk, possibly within two weeks, the remaining we would raise from an FGN bond auction this December,\u201d she stressed.\n\nOniha also announced plans to issue some green bonds in 2022, with the hope that the government would be able to meet required conditions and certifications especially at a time of global call for green projects.\n\nNigeria has already issued 2 green bonds \u2013 first in 2017, then in 2019, totaling about N25.89bn, to finance projects, including renewable energy, desertification.\n\nOniha said the government is hopeful of even higher amounts from green bonds in 2022, considering so much has happened about the environment, which should encourage more investors to be looking in that direction.\n\nOniha had earlier told the participants that between January 2011 and September 2021, the DMO raised over $15.368 billion through Eurobonds and a $300 million Diaspora Bond to finance Budget deficits and various projects.\n\nShe said through these securities issuance in the international capital markets has expanded sources of Federal Government funding and created opportunities for Nigerian corporates including banks to raise capital abroad.\n\nShe said, most importantly, the proceeds of Eurobonds has also boosted Nigeria\u2019s External Reserves thereby supporting the Naira.\n\nShe also noted that the DMO recognises the need for cautious borrowing and that proceeds should be deployed judiciously to promote inclusive growth.\n\nShe assured that new borrowings are undertaken in compliance with legislations and that public debt is managed in accordance with international best practice and that Debt is serviced in a timely manner.\n\nThe DMO undertakes an annual Debt Sustainability Analysis and is guided by a MediumTerm Debt Management Strategy.\n\nThe latest report about to be released by the debt office indicates that the country\u2019s Debt to GDP at about 21.61 percent.",

          "text": "A more secure growth recovery and slowing inflation would give Nigeria scope for a one percentage point (1-ppt) policy rate hike to 12.5 percent in 2022, Renaissance Capital, an emerging and frontier markets-focused investment bank, said in a note on Monday.\n\nThe investment bank, which has its headquarter in Moscow, Russia, believes the policy rate hike would help to contain inflation, which it sees in the lower double digits; and to contain a depreciating naira.\n\nAlready, the firm noted that some African central banks have started to tighten their monetary policy before the growth recovery becomes entrenched.\n\nIn November 2021, Ghana and Zambia hiked their policy rates by 1 ppt and 50 bpts, respectively, to 14.5 percent and 9.0 percent, while Nigeria and Kenya kept theirs at 11.5 percent and 7.0 percent.\n\n\u201cWe expect inflation to soften in Nigeria, Egypt, Ghana and Zambia, and to pick up in Kenya and Rwanda in 2022. We forecast rate hikes in Nigeria and Zambia where there are deeply negative real rates, and think the risk is skewed to the upside for Kenya and Ghana,\u201d Yvonne Mhango, economist for Sub-Saharan Africa at Renaissance Capital, said.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s central bank holds monetary policy rate at 11.5% amid recession\n\nRenaissance Capital forecasts headline inflation of 14.5 percent and 12.4 percent at the end of 2021 and 2022, respectively, which implies the 6-9 percent inflation target will remain elusive for at least the short term.\n\nWhile it forecasts a policy rate hike in 2022, the investment bank expects treasury yields to remain flat, with upside risk from an increase in the government\u2019s domestic borrowing.\n\n\u201cWe think there is upside risk to our 2022 inflation forecast from: insecurity (overall conflict across northern Nigeria, disrupting the on-going harvest for millions of households, according to Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET); FX depreciation (we see the I&E window FX rate at N482/$1 at YE22); high transport costs; a below average harvest; and the high cost of imported food,\u201d Mhango said in the note seen by BusinessDay.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) left its policy rate at 11.5 percent on November 23, 2021, its last meeting of the year.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank has kept the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 11.5 percent since September 2020, from 13.5 percent, to improve the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nEncouragingly, year-on-year (YoY) headline inflation slowed for the seventh consecutive month to 16.0 percent in October, albeit slowly, after peaking at 18.2 percent in March. This is being led by food inflation which slowed on the back of the ongoing September-to-December harvest. However, imported food price inflation remains elevated.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) says the near-term outlook of the Nigerian economy is brightening significantly, with improvements projected into the short- and the medium-term.\n\nNigeria\u2019s output growth rate is projected to remain positive from 4.03 percent in the third quarter of 2021 to nearly 2.91 percent in the fourth of 2021, implying a total growth of about 3.10 percent for 2021.\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank project real growth rates of 2.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively while the estimate by Nigeria\u2019s ministry of finance and national planning stands at 3.0 percent. Generally, real GDP growth rate is projected to remain robust and strengthen within the short-term, regardless of the imminent vulnerabilities.",

          "text": "Airlines operating the Nigeria-London route could be losing about N965 million daily as a result of flight cancellations following the UK travel ban on Nigeria, BusinessDay\u2019s findings have revealed.\n\nPrior to the ban, London was one of the top destinations visited by Nigerians, but those who already made bookings are asking for a refund as airlines cancel flights following the ban.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s analysis of passenger traffic and frequency of airlines shuttling between the two countries puts the cumulative revenue loss for airlines at N965 million based on an average of 3,860 passengers processed daily by airlines.\n\nOn Saturday, the UK government said Nigeria has been added to the countries on its red list due to the discovery of COVID-19 Omicron cases linked to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the new protocol, non-UK and non-Irish citizens who are travelling in from Nigeria will not be allowed entry into the UK.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that British Airways which operates a daily return flight from London to Lagos and Abuja processes an average of 600 arriving passengers and 600 departing passengers on Lagos and Abuja routes.\n\nRead Also: UK travel ban: Passengers stranded over flight cancellations\n\nThis implies that daily, the airline processes 1,200 passengers for both arriving and returning on London-Abuja and London-Lagos routes.\n\nAlso, Virgin Atlantic which operates a daily return flight from London to Lagos and Abuja processes an average of 700 arriving passengers and 700 departing passengers on Lagos and Abuja routes.\n\nThis implies that daily, Virgin Atlantic processes 1,400 passengers for both arriving and returning on London-Abuja and London-Lagos routes.\n\nEthiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways, KLM, Air France, Lufthansa, Air Rwanda and Kenya Airways which also operate daily in and out of Nigeria, carrying connecting passengers to London process an average of 600 arriving and departing passengers with at least 30 percent passengers connecting flights to London.\n\nThis implies that with each of the airlines processing 180 departing and arriving passengers daily to the UK, these seven airlines process 1,260 passengers to the UK.\n\nCumulatively, all international airlines operating the London-Nigeria route carry an average of 3,860 passengers on the two routes daily.\n\nA one-way ticket from Lagos or Abuja to London and vice-versa costs an average of N250,000. This implies that the airlines may be losing over N965 million on the UK-London route daily.\n\nSusan Akporiaye, president, National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA) told BusinessDay that while airlines are rescheduling their flights, individuals have been cancelling their trips since the UK ban.\n\n\u201cThe UK government did not stop airlines from going to the UK. Even the UK and Irish citizens who will travel will be quarantined at government facilities. What will happen is that airlines will stop going there because it won\u2019t make economic sense, as 2,300 pounds is a lot of money for an average passenger to pay to quarantine,\u201d Akporiaye said.\n\nShe added that the ban was affecting travel agents and airlines as individuals are requesting that tickets already issued be cancelled pending when the UK lifts the ban.\n\nAbigail Andrew, a travel agent, told BusinessDay that thousands of Nigerians travel to London daily, as the UK remains a top destination for studies, business, tourism and visits to families and friends.\n\n\u201cThe market for travel agents and airlines operating in Nigeria has always been the UK, US and Canada before COVID-19. But with COVID and UAE ban, we saw a lot of traffic to the UK route. The UK tickets kept selling on a daily basis even while Dubai was closed,\u201d Andrew said.\n\nSindy Foster, principal managing partner, Avaero Capital Partners also told BusinessDay that British Airways rescheduled its flight and will still operate since UK and Irish nationals and residents can still travel to the UK.\n\nFoster explained that a lot of Nigerians also hold British and Irish passports so they will be subject to the same rules.\n\nShe said the need to quarantine even for fully vaccinated passengers, in a government facility, is a big deterrent to travel to the UK. Both in terms of time, comfort and cost.\n\n\u201cTravelling to Nigeria whilst it is currently still possible from the UK, now attracts the risk of quarantine on the return. So it will likely reduce visits to Nigeria for all but essential travel. The existing protocol is due to be reviewed on 20th December,\u201d Foster said.\n\nSpeaking on how the new variant has affected travel, she said Omicron has definitely affected the recovery of the travel and hospitality sectors.\n\n\u201cThe new variant has reintroduced fear of the unknown into decision making. This came at the time people had started to gain the confidence to travel.\n\nFlights scheduled to operate on Sunday and other days have since been cancelled and rescheduled following the UK travel ban.",

          "title": "Omicron: Nigerian govt fumes over U.K. travel ban, vows to retaliate",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government has criticized the British government over its decision to impose travel ban on the country, as part of measures to curtail the spread of Omicron, a new Covid-19 variant first detected in South Africa two weeks ago.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who addressed a press on Monday over the development, said he hopes the U.K. government will immediately rescind the decision to put Nigeria on its travel red list.\n\nMohammed argued that the decision by the British government to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs you are aware, Britain has put Nigeria on its red list and banned foreign travels from our country. This is as a result of the discovery of Covid-19 cases, Omicron variant, in Nigeria. Britain now joins other countries, including Canada, which have taken a similar action against Nigeria over Omicron.\n\n\u201cLet me say straight away that it\u2019s up to the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) to respond to this action by the British government and others, and I have no doubt that the Committee will respond appropriately.\n\n\u201cHowever, as the Spokesman for the Federal Government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by tye British government to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science.\n\n\u201cHow do you slam this kind of discriminatory action on a country of 200 million people, just because of less than two dozen cases? Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned. The two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travellers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, let me use this opportunity to highlight the fact that travel ban, the type that has been slammed on some African countries, is a knee-jerk reaction that can only be detrimental to our quest to most conclusively tackle this pandemic. Instead of these reflex responses that are driven by fear, rather than science, why can\u2019t the world take a serious look at the issue of access to vaccines, and ensure that it is based on the principles grounded in the right of every human to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political belief, economic or any other social condition.\n\n\u201cMany developed countries have used the advantage of their enormous resources or relationship to sign agreements with manufacturers to supply their countries with vaccines ahead of making them available for use by other countries. Even before the clinical trials were completed, millions of doses of the most promising vaccines have been bought by Britain, US, Japan and the EU. Some of these countries bought doses five times the size of their population, while others, mostly in Africa, have little or no access to vaccines. This is the real issue to address, instead of choosing the easy path of travel bans, which the UN Secretary General called Travel Apartheid. Let the world know that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, in the wake of the discovery of Omicron, the PSC has reviewed its International Travel Protocol. The revised protocol, which came into effect yesterday (5 Dec. 2021), is aimed at further reducing the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19, especially the variants of concern. Under the revised protocol, passengers arriving in Nigeria are expected to provide evidence of and comply with the following rules:\n\n\u2013 COVID-19 PCR test to be done within 48 hours before departure\n\n\u2013 Post-arrival Day 2 COVID-19 PCR test\n\n\u2013 Self-isolation for 7 days (for unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated individuals)\n\n\u2013 Day 7 post-arrival exit PCR test (for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated\n\nindividuals).\n\n8. On the other hand, out-bound passengers are required to provide:\n\n\u2013 Valid evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19\n\n\u2013 Negative PCR test result within 48hrs from the time boarding.\n\n\u201cThese are science-driven actions, rather than those based on emotions and other extraneous reasons. However, if any country is not satisfied with them, why not simply subject Nigerians arriving in their country to their own PCR tests and proven conditions, like quarantine, instead of banning them outrightly?\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope the British government will immediately review the decision to put Nigeria on its red list and rescind it immediately. Nigeria has handled the Covid-19 pandemic with utmost responsibility and based on science, and has rightly earned global accolades for its efforts. Nigeria does not belong on any country\u2019s red list.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

However, as far back as 2016 I cautioned them not to present any member of the family with questionable credentials for an elective posts because it could subject the family name to ridicule. Many of them felt very uncomfortable with me and almost ostracised me. Despite the cold treatment, I stood with the family through out the 2018 elections and did my very best for the family and the party.\n\n\u201cThere have been numerous insinuations that HE Seyi Makinde is backing my candidacy, this is not true as I have never discussed my aspirations with him despite our closeness.\n\n\u201cI am aware of several calls made to HE Seyi Makinde by members of my family to \u201ckick me out\u201d of Oyo State like \u201d polio\u201d but I am not deterred one bit. Those close to me know that I am always guided by my convictions. I am also aware of a well orchestral plans by those close to the family to expose my paternity and brand me as a bastard.\n\n\u201cIn all of these I have come to realise that you are only as useful to some people to the level by which they can use you.

Mariam Yalwaji Katagum, made this commitment yesterday in Abuja while declaring open the first edition of Enjoy Nigeria Expo (ENEX) 2021 with the theme: \u201cA Future Assured Through Creativity.\u201d\n\nThe minister, who observed that the Nigerian creative industry was the fastest growing in the world and had seen a period of rapid growth spurred by emerging digital trends of technology which support content creation, digital learning and creativity, described Nollywood as a monumental success in the country\u2019s creative industry space, adding that said as a result of the industry\u2019s financial potential and job creation capacity, it became a focus for interventions, investments, and partnerships.\n\n\u201cAs the exploits of Nollywood, the Nigerian film industry has shown us, when Nigerians decide to pay attention to any particular sector, we excel in it beyond our dreams. For example, the Nigerian fashion industry, which is now a pacesetter on the African continent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA few days ago, we had the highly successful Arise Fashion Show 2021, as part of Dubai Expo\u2019s Nigeria National Day events, which took place in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The show captivated the audience with the dynamic creativity and innovative styles of Nigerian fashion icons and pace setters,\u201d she said.\n\nKatagum therefore said ENEX 2021 is tailored to draw the attention of stakeholders in the nation\u2019s creative, cultural, entertainment and tourism sectors, with emphasis on women and youth, and the potentials of the sectors they operate in, adding that it is expected to assist them to build capacity in their respective businesses, as well as show them the various ways that they can turn their simple arts and skills into high revenue earners.\n\n\u201cThis forum is also expected to draw the attention of the world to the fact that Nigeria has a lot of untapped potentials where investments can be made with high returns.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this event provides an opportunity to appreciate those who have in the past, persevered in the promotion of these sectors, without much encouragement. Some of these pacesetters will be recognised and appreciated during the entertainment events that will take place as the event proceeds,\u201d she said.\n\nThe minister said at the end of the one-week event, a platform would be launched to provide master classes in business development for interested stakeholders.",

          "text": "The 2023 presidential aspiration of Senator Pius Anyim got a tremendous boost on Monday when a coalition of over 30 Northern civil society organisations and youth groups under the umbrella of Arewa Concerned Civil Society Organisations of Nigeria (ACCSON) endorsed his ambition.\n\nThe groups addressed a world press conference at the Arewa House Kaduna on Monday where they adopted Anyim as their presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\nAfter the press conference, all the civil society organisations banded together in a grand ceremony and were inaugurated as Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim Support Groups in Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe inauguration was conducted by Alhaji Yaro Makama Rigachikun, first chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna State.\n\nAddressing Anyim as \u201ca symbol of National Unity,\u201d the groups said his emergence as a presidential aspirant was a prayer answered.\n\nComrade Abdulsalam Mohammed Kazeem, spokesperson of the ACCSON, said Anyim responded to their request to contest the 2023 presidency.\n\n\u201dTo set the record straight, on 23rd of March 2021, over 30 Civil Society Organizations of Northern extraction met at Mallam Aminu Kano Center for Democratic Research, Mambayya House, Kano State, on way forward and the unity of our nation,\u201c he said\n\nListing the civil society organisations to include, Arewa Youth Assembly for sustainable growth; Arewa Youth and Students Forum; Concerned Northern Forum; North East Peace Movement; Arewa Youth Council of Nigeria; Northern Youth Assembly for Tranquility; Northern Women Initiative Forum; North East Development Council; North Central Grassroots Foundation; Arewa Female Youth Ambassadors Peace Initiative; Initiative of Youth Advocate on Humanitarian Affairs; Arewa Youth Movement of Nigeria, Tiv Youth Initiative for Peace, Unity and Development, Middlebelt Vanguard; Northern Youth Network For Good Governance; etc., Kazeem said, \u201cWe x-rayed the current happenings; which include unity in diversity, rotational presidency, insecurity, youth unemployment, youth inclusiveness in Governance among others,\u201d and concluded that for equity and fairness, the Southeast should produce the next president of Nigeria.\n\nThe speech reads in part, \u201cThe leadership of various organizations at that sitting supported one Nigerian project. We realize that only two regions out of the six geo-political regions have not occupied either President or vice-President seats since 1999 till date, which is unfair and against any democratic standard worldwide.\n\n\u201cFor instance; between 1999 to 2007, it was South West and North East, and between 2007 to 2015 it was between North West, South-South and North West while between 2015 till date it is between North West and South West!\n\n\u201cThe South East, for instance, are part and parcel of the Nigerian project from day one till date; and, they should be treated fairly just like other zones of the country. They too deserve to get what others have gotten because they have paid their dues in terms of contributions and consolidation of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe region is being captured in all other sectors of the Nigerian economy based on a federal character from 1999 till date, but are denied either of the two positions mentioned earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing by the above facts it\u2019s now clear to us as progressives; that the political elites are against the unity of Nigeria. We the Youths are the future and hope of the Nation as well as critical stakeholders in nation-building; In consideration of our population, we will henceforth cease to be spectators. Rather we have decided to be part of the process of mobilizing/sensitizing youths from our region to get their voters card to the point of telling them who to vote for during elections. We will defend the unity of Nigeria, which is non-negotiable. For now, this is only achievable by a rotation of the presidency. You can also call this periodic power shifts.\n\n\u201cWith the rotation of the presidency; We believe strongly that all these agitations for separation will stop not only in the south East but in other regions since the essence is to quench marginalization and promote unity, brotherhood and pan Nigerian sentiments.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we hereby urge all political parties to zone their presidential ticket to the South East for justice, equity and fairness. Further to the above, we hereby present a bridge-builder to the entire youths of Northern extraction, as our candidate for the 2023 presidency.\u201d\n\nThe groups said that their decision was informed by Anyim\u2019s sterling leadership qualities, his capacity and competency and his penchant for bridge-building which makes him not only a detribalised Nigerian but someone with the best intentions for the youths and the North.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim is an accomplished statesman, a legal professional, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation and former President of the Senate and Chairman of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cHe is a detribalized Nigerian who has good intentions for the Youths and our region. As a former Senate President, history has it that before his emergence as the President of the Senate, the Senate was a troubled institution. His emergence helped to bring to an end all forms of the crisis rocking the senate. This was achieved because he introduced inclusiveness in all the activities of the red chamber.\n\n\u201cAs a Secretary to the Government of the Federation, he helped the Jonathan administration to stabilize the administration and the Nigerian economy through numerous projects that are visible and useful to our region and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cAs the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, he ensured there was a good relationship between the executive and the legislature. He has friends, colleagues and political associates across the 109 senatorial districts of the country.\n\n\u201cSenator Anyim should be our presidential candidate irrespective of party affiliations as history will judge our actions today.\u201d\n\nThe groups said Senator Anyim remains the best for the Northern region and the nation because \u201che has been someone who has full knowledge of Governance from the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Arms, which remains the first of its kind in the history of our nation.\u201d\n\nInaugurating the Arewa Concerned Civil Society Organisations of Nigeria Support Group for Senator Anyim Pius Anyim for President 2023 the over 80-year-old Alhaji Rigachikun echoed the same sentiments, insisting that with Anyim as President, Nigeria will be more united and prosperous.\n\n\u201cI am immensely delighted by this privilege to conduct the formal inauguration of the Arewa Concerned Civil Society Organisations of Nigeria (ACCSON) Support Group for Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim for President, 2023,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs 2023 general elections approach, many people from all over Nigeria are declaring their intentions to contest for the office of president of Nigeria. For us in the North, we cherish and respect the principles of justice, equity and fairness. The unity, peace and progress of Nigeria will depend on how well we continue to respect these principles. The office of president of Nigeria is a very important office because the general well-being of our country depends on who occupies that office.\n\n\u201cThat is why we, as Nigerians, must be very careful in choosing who becomes president of Nigeria come 2023. The president of Nigeria we need in 2023 must be a man of integrity and capacity with proven knowledge of how government works. He must be a man who believes in one Nigeria and has demonstrated that by how he relates with people from every part of this country. We need a man who will build bridges of friendship and togetherness. We need a tried and tested consensus builder to bring Nigeria back together as one united and indivisible country. We need a man who is competent and has proved his competence from the services he has rendered to our country in various capacities.\n\n\u201cI have looked around among all the people who have openly declared their intention to run for office of president, including those whose intentions are still in the realm of speculations and rumour, I have not seen anybody as suitable as Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim. I have known Sen. Anyim for many years and I can tell you, with every conviction, that he is the man we are looking for. With Anyim as President, Nigeria will be more united and prosperous.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you the youth, men and women of goodwill to go out to your various communities and towns and spread the good news that the right man to be president of Nigeria come 2023 is Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim.\u201d TheNiche\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Few days ago, the social media was hit with reports that Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu doled out N450 million to tertiary institutions in the state to woo them to join the anticipated Walk for Peace.\n\nThe unverified report was first published by one of the popular online platforms. After that, the blogs and other unpopular news platforms feasted on it.\n\nIt claimed that sources in government had it that the governor released N450 million for the Peace Walk and that the walk was scheduled to hold on Monday December 6, 2021.\n\nGenesis of the Walk for Peace\n\nSanwo-Olu had in a statewide broadcast the same day the White Paper on the Judicial Panel of Inquiry was released called for a Peace Walk to heal the wounds inflicted on the State by the EndSARS protest of October 20, 2020, which culminated in the disputed Lekki Tollgate shooting. He invited Falz, Mr. Macaroni, Seun Kuti and others for a Peace Walk on a yet to be announced date in December 2021.\n\n\u201cIn December, I will be leading A WALK FOR PEACE to herald the healing of our land.

The walk has generated lots of mixed feelings as many youths pledged to walk with the governor. The Coalition of Oodua Self Determination Groups (COSEG) first came up to say they would walk with the governor.\n\nSanwo-Olu in LASU\n\nThe governor went to LASU to unveil a new students arcade and used the opportunity to address the students to partner with government to move the state forward. The governor was welcomed by the Students Union Government, SUG President, Comrade Oladipupo Uthman Badmus; Speaker of the Students Union Representatives, Mustapha Adejuwon, and hundreds of students.\n\nBadmus, in his remarks said \u201cTo Mr Governor, Sir, it is what you signed up for but we are indebted to you. Be rest assured, whenever you walk, we will walk with you. We will be by your side. Whenever you run, we will run with you to the end.\u201d\n\nVerdict\n\nAt no point did the governor promised to release N450 million to the students in LASU and others to walk with him. In fact, no date has been fixed for the walk yet. The online report claimed that it got its clue from a government source. It said the government source also said the walk would take place on Monday, December 6. How can a walk, which date has not been fixed take place on the day claimed in the report. Ostensibly, that day has passed with no walk in sight. As at today, it is not yet certain if the walk will go ahead. How then can N450 million be released for an uncertain walk with no date yet? It means the report is not true, unverified and fake. Moreover, sources in government have punctured the report and dubbed it figment of imagination.",
          "summary": "It claimed that sources in government had it that the governor released N450 million for the Peace Walk and that the walk was scheduled to hold on Monday December 6, 2021.\nHe invited Falz, Mr. Macaroni, Seun Kuti and others for a Peace Walk on a yet to be announced date in December 2021.\n\u201cIn December, I will be leading A WALK FOR PEACE to herald the healing of our land.\nMr. Macaroni, Falz and Seun Kuti turned down the governor\u2019s request for a Peace Walk.\nHow then can N450 million be released for an uncertain walk with no date yet?",

Their expulsion followed investigation and establishment of their guilt by the Students Disciplinary Committee.\u201d\n\nAkanbi urged the Nigerian government and the National Universities Commission (NUC) to develop regulations that make living on campus mandatory for all students in Nigeria\u2019s higher institutions.\n\n\u201cStudents are also vulnerably exposed to anti-social influences which are inimical to their health and academic career.\n\n\u201cExposure to negative influence outside the university campus is majorly responsible for the involvement of some students in internet fraud, substance abuse and other untoward crimes.\n\n\u201cMy administration is working very hard to reverse this trend.

          "text": "There was momentary confusion Sunday at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Lagos following the cancellation of the Lagos-London Heathrow, United Kingdom bound flight by the British Airways.\n\nAlthough, the airline said the cancellation was due to operational reasons, Blueprint, however, gathered that the development might not be unconnected with the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nAfter 21 Omicron cases linked to the country, the United Kingdom added Nigeria to its red alert with effect from Monday (4.00am).\n\nCuriously, the airline did not also operate its inbound flight from London to Lagos, thus raising the suspicion that the red alert signal by the UK might have fully taken effect.\n\nSources at the airport linked it to the implementation of the travel ban imposed on countries considered red flags to the new Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nWith 134 Omicron cases reported in the UK, from 4am on Monday UK and Irish citizens and residents arriving from Nigeria must isolate in a Government-approved quarantine facility for 10 days, and receive two negative PCR tests, as further precautionary action is taken against the Omicron variant.\n\nWhen Blueprint visited the MMIA Sunday evening, several passengers who had thronged the airport for check-in procedures were turned back as there were few staffers of the airline to attend to their inquiry.\n\nAirport sources further said \u201cthe situation was to get a clearer picture of what\u2019s happening around the Omicron variant of a thing. Don\u2019t forget that Nigeria has been added to the travel red alert. So, I have the feeling that the airline wants to get a clearer picture from the UK authority.\u201d\n\nBut some of the airline workers, who volunteered certain information to the visibly disturbed passengers, said the flight was only rescheduled for the early hours of Monday.\n\nUpon further probe into reasons for the cancellation, flyers, signed by the BA Customer Service Duty Manager Nwanorue Alexander, were freely distributed among the passengers.\n\nOur checks revealed that BA flights from London which ought to have left Saturday night also did not operate.\n\nIt was rescheduled to leave Sunday morning.\n\nAlerting its passengers an email Sunday, the airline wrote: \u201cWe would like to inform you of a change to the departure time of your flight to London Heathrow. Due to operational reasons, we have had to make this adjustment to our schedule. Your flight will now be departing Lagos a day later than originally scheduled.\u201d\n\nNigeria added to red list\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria has been added to the travel red list Monday after 21 cases of Omicron reported in England linked to travel from this country.\n\nCurrently, the vast majority of cases in the UK have clear links to overseas travel from South Africa and Nigeria.\n\nOver the past one week, 21 reported Omicron cases reported in England were said to have originated from Nigeria.\n\nUK Secretary of State for Health Sajid Javid via his official twitter handle had said UK and Irish citizens travelling from Nigeria would be allowed into the country after quarantine for a certain period.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cIn light of the most recent data, we are taking further action to slow the incursion of the Omicron variant. From 4am on Monday, only UK/Irish citizens and residents travelling from Nigeria will be allowed entry and must isolate in a managed quarantine facility.\n\n\u201cAnd from 4am on Tuesday, anyone travelling to the UK from countries not on the Red List will be required to take a pre-departure test, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\n\u201cVaccines remain our first line of defence\u2014 the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones. Please get vaccinated or #GetBoosted as soon as you can.\u201d\n\nSince then, the geographical spread of Omicron has been on the rise, with 37 countries around the world now reporting Omicron cases and over 134 cases identified in the UK.\n\nNew analysis conducted by the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) indicates that the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron variant, which increases the efficacy of pre-departure testing as it is more likely to identify positive cases before travel.\n\nIn light of this emerging evidence and the changing global picture with regards to the spread of Omicron, from 4am on Tuesday, anyone wishing to travel to the UK from countries and territories not on the red list must also show proof of a negative PCR or LFD pre-departure test, taken no earlier than 48 hours before departure. This applies to vaccinated passengers and children aged 12 and above.\n\nAirlines will be required to check for pre-departure tests alongside completed Passenger Locator Form, and passengers will not be allowed to board a flight without providing evidence of a negative test result.\n\nGiven the reduced incubation period of the Omicron variant, passengers are advised to take the pre-departure test as close as possible to their scheduled departure to the UK and no earlier than 48 hours before travelling.\n\nAdditional measures were set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on November 27, and the Government will review all temporary measures after three weeks to ensure that they remain necessary and proportionate, and this will take place on December 20.\n\nJavid said: \u201cWe knew this winter would be challenging but the arrival of a new variant means we must further strengthen our defences.\n\n\u201cAs our world-leading scientists continue to understand more about the Omicron variant we are taking decisive action to protect public health and the progress of our COVID-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cI urge everyone to do their bit to slow the spread by following the new travel rules, wearing masks where mandatory and most importantly getting the booster jab when called.\u201d",
          "summary": "After 21 Omicron cases linked to the country, the United Kingdom added Nigeria to its red alert with effect from Monday (4.00am).\nSources at the airport linked it to the implementation of the travel ban imposed on countries considered red flags to the new Omicron variant of COVID-19.\nAirport sources further said \u201cthe situation was to get a clearer picture of what\u2019s happening around the Omicron variant of a thing.\nHe tweeted, \u201cIn light of the most recent data, we are taking further action to slow the incursion of the Omicron variant.\n\u201cAs our world-leading scientists continue to understand more about the Omicron variant we are taking decisive action to protect public health and the progress of our COVID-19 vaccination programme.",

Why single out African countries? Singling out African countries is very unfair, non-scientific, and discriminatory. Lift bans on African countries!\u201d Adesina said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGlobal vaccines\u2019 and travel apartheid against Africa are endangering lives, hurting economies, lives, jobs and livelihoods, from a pandemic Africa did not cause. End the apartheid. Respect Africa!\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: UK Red Listing Nigeria Is Unjust, Discriminatory \u2013 Lai Mohammed\n\nNigeria on Monday became the latest African country to be banned by the United Kingdom over the virus\u2019 spread.\n\nThe country joins its Southern African counterparts \u2013 South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Zambia \u2013 on the list of restricted countries.\n\nAnnouncing the ban of travellers from Nigeria on Saturday, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said most \u201ca significant number\u201d of Omicron cases have been linked to travel with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are 27 cases already in England and that\u2019s growing and Nigeria now is second only to South Africa in terms of linked cases to Omicron,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Where is the Science?\u2019\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa has also criticised the travel bans.\n\nMr Ramaphosa, who spoke at the Dakar International Forum on Peace and Security on Monday, said the travel bans signalled western hypocrisy.\n\nThe Omicron variant was first identified in Southern Africa but is believed to have been spreading in Europe undetected much earlier.\n\n\u201d . . . when South African scientists discovered the new variant Omicron, we immediately took on the responsibility of informing the world. However what was the result?\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa queried.\n\n\u201cThe western countries imposed a ban \u2013 as it were to punish excellence coming from Africa, preventing our people from travelling. However, this new variant continues to spread across the globe, beyond Southern Africa, including in their own countries.\n\n\u201cAnd so one asks, where is science? These countries have always said to us that we should base our decisions on science. But when the time comes for them to apply it to themselves, they do not, but resort to their own self-interest.\n\n\u201cWe say that these bans must be removed with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cThe devastating impact this travel ban will have is well-known. The UN Secretary-General has called it travel apartheid.\n\n\u201cThese travel bans will devastate the economies of Southern Africa that are dependent on tourism. They go precisely against what was agreed at the G20 in Italy earlier this year when it was said we must open up travel so the tourism sector can recover.\n\n\u201cInstead they are closing it down in Africa. This is hypocrisy of the worst order and must come to an end.\u201d",

This is really impressive. I can say without any equivocation that this hospital has more high-tech medical equipment than all the hospitals in Lagos put together. This is most certainly the best equipped hospital in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cThe medical mission was initiated to cater for the heath need of indigent Nigerian patients in need of cardiovascular healthcare which is quite expensive and not within the means of most Nigerians. With this initiative, there is increased accessibility to these life-saving therapies and increase awareness in the community on prevention and treatment of heart diseases.\u201d\n\nOlofintila said VOOM Foundation is a US-based team of Surgeons and Clinicians which provides Clinical expertise, free surgeries and major surgical consumables such as Oxygenators and Valves among others for these surgeries.\n\nHe added that the HHF was set up to provide care (surgery) to indigent patients and training to willing Clinicians.\n\n\u201cABUAD Multi-system Hospital was established to provide affordable world-class medicare, quality Medical Education and put an end to outward medical tourism through which Nigerians fluff away millions of Dollars on medical bills outside the country\u201d.\n\nOn the competence of ABUAD hospital, Olofintila quoted the immediate past Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Folorunso Adewole to have said: \u201cThis Hospital will offer us what we hitherto believe cannot happen in this country. It will also improve the poor Health Indicators in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith what I have seen here today, this Hospital matches the best in the world and it will certainly put an end to medical tourism outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti",

I am ashamed of the sort of accommodation our staff are living in.\n\n\u201cThe council has met the Minister of FCT and he has assured us to do something soon. And a delegation will soon go to FERMA to come in and give the university special consideration especially the roads within the mini campus and the residential areas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will definitely partner with government agencies, we will attract funding and invite investors and discuss with government to build befitting houses that befits a university lecturer status,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the retreat, \u201cNavigating Myriad of Challenges in Managing Universities in Today\u2019s World,\u201d he said they all have a role in repositioning the university by thinking out of the box to surmount the never ending challenges they struggle to carry out their duties.\n\nThe pro-chancellor identified problem of funding and staff attitude to work among reasons for organising the retreat, adding that the session, hopefully would chat a new course for the varsity.\n\nEarlier the Vice Chancellor Prof. Abdul-Rasheed Na\u2019Allah said many factors were fighting against the university, adding that many staff do not do their duties but collect salary.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey do not come to work on time, some do not teach while others spend just an hour and leave.\n\n\u201cIf we must attain the greatness and if we are ready to serve Nigeria truthfully speaking we must put all these things aside, and stop rumours and allegations. If we ready to move forward we must jettison the past.\u201d\n\nHe said the university must be a class of its own and does not need to drag or copy others as it is destiny for other universities to look up to it for excellence and copy them in the concentration of funding, admission, structures and competitiveness , etc.\n\nOn his part the Permanent Secretary of Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono said the retreat was put together to explain the separation of powers and roles to avoid conflicts in the university.\n\nHe said retreat has proven to be useful and improved governing of universities.\n\nEchono noted that Nigerian universities were faced with challenges of sustainable funding, autonomy, industrial harmony, institutional ranking, compliance with status regulations and enhanced governance and administration.\n\nHe opined that to address and mitigate these challenges, the universities would need to remain proactive and continue to come up with appropriate responses particularly in this knowledge driven era.\n\n\u201cA veritable tool in this regard is regular interface between members of councils and principal officers and other stakeholders involved in management of university,\u201d he said.\n\nOn issue of university sustainable funding, he added: \u201cI am of the very strong view that as long as we depend on government budgeting to run university systems, given inadequate priority given to the education sector coupled with other external factors and dwindling resources, expectation from the budgets will continue to remain a challenge.\u201d\n\nHe said funding should be determined based on cost in a particular course of study and what it takes to produce a student over the course of duration of that programme and every stakeholder should partake in it.\n\nKuni Tyessi in Abuja",
          "summary": "The Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of University of Abuja Governing Council, Modibbo Mohammed has disclosed that the university has mounted 24 hours security patrol not only within the campus but within the perimeters of the tertiary institution.\nThe initiative, according to him, was to prevent a repeat of the recent kidnapping that occurred at its staff quarter.\n\u201cWe have also employed additional hunters, vigilantes to patrol in areas that are not fenced because it is a very vast land,\u201d he said.\nOn the staff quarters which was then reported to be in a deplorable state, he said: \u201cOur staff housing is below standard.\n\u201cThe council has met the Minister of FCT and he has assured us to do something soon.",

          "title": "Nigeria: $10bn Train 7 Risks Suspension as Senate, Saipem Bicker",
          "text": "The ongoing bickering between the Senate and Saipem Nigeria Limited over alleged violation of the Nigerian Local Content Act in the award of contracts for the delivery of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG)\u2019s $10 billion Train 7 project by the latter, may degenerate to the suspension of the multi-billion dollar project, experts have warned.\n\nAn oil and gas services expert and Vice Chairman of the Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN), Mr. Ranti Omole, gave the warning, pointing out that the progress of the project delivery may be stalled if the Senate exerts its power and forces Saipem to halt further Train 7-related contract awards.\n\nOmole told THISDAY in a phone interview that if that happens, it would have huge negative impact on the nation and NLNG itself, as it would also stall the drive to enhance LNG export and increase the federation\u2019s revenue and other derivatives from the Train 7 project.\n\nThe Senate Committee on Local Content had last Wednesday, accused Saipem of deliberately circumventing Nigeria\u2019s Local Content Act by sidelining Nigerian manufacturers in the bidding for the contract awards as provided for in the law.\n\nBut Saipem responded by saying that it acted on the instruction of its client \u2013NLNG, adding that all it did was within the scope provided by NLNG which allowed it to source for highly specialised steels not available in Nigeria from outside the country.\n\nIt stated that the arrangement was within the finance export scheme between NLNG, South Korea and Italy.\n\nTrain 7 is expected to add eight million tonnes of gas supply to the existing 22 million tonnes and ramp up NLNG\u2019s production by about 35 per cent.\n\nContractors for the project are SCD JV Consortium, comprising Nigerian affiliates of Saipem (Italy), Chiyoda (Japan) and Daewoo (South Korea.\n\nCommenting on the Senate\u2019s squabble with Saipem and the implication of that on the project and the Nigerian economy, Omole said, \u201cNow, if the Senate is forcing a stop on future contracts award and project activities, definitely, it will stall the progress of the project and also stall the time to get the gas \u2013 NLNG\u2019s export. It will also prolong the time the country wants to get more from LNG export.\n\n\u201cAnd nowadays, it\u2019s not just for you to get to market, you just need to get to market at the right time because there are quite a number of LNG projects that are pushing out all over the world. So, it\u2019s good for us to get to market early.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, the impact will be huge if the Senate stalls the project by forcing a stop on future contract award for the continuous delivery.\u201d\n\nThe PETAN vice chairman said the good side of the intervention was that the alarm raised by Senate on the alleged violation of Local Content Act was a warning for Saipem to ensure compliance and improve their grade level to accommodate more local participation.\n\nHe added that the Senate\u2019s alarm was also a warning to all multinational companies in Nigeria that it was no longer business as usual, stressing that contractors may need to further look for where Nigerian companies could do more work by getting technical support from foreign companies whom they partner with in projects execution.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s the good side of it. It\u2019s a warning that it\u2019s no longer business as usual \u2013 you cannot sign Local Content Plan and do whatever you like. So, the more there is competence in Nigerian companies and they get involved in projects execution, the better for the economy,\u201d Omole stated.\n\nHe argued that the Senate has the responsibility to act if Saipem was not complying with the local content plan of the Train 7 project by not patronising local companies that have the capacities to participate in the project.\n\nHowever, in its reaction, NLNG reiterated its full commitment to the delivery of the Train 7 Local Content Plan and the overall delivery of the project.\n\nIn a note sent to THISDAY, yesterday, signed by its General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, Mrs. Eyono Fatayi-Williams, NLNG disclaimed \u201cthe importation of highly specialised steel equipment\u201d, as contained in Saipem\u2019s presentation at the Senate, saying it was based on the approved Nigerian Content Plan for the Train 7 Project.\n\nThe liquefaction company maintained that it was fully committed to its partnership with NCDMB in delivering the Nigerian Content Plan for the Project, in line with its vision to be a global LNG company, helping to build a better Nigeria.\n\nNLNG added that it was working closely with Train 7 Engineering, Equipment and Construction (EPC) contractors and stakeholders in Bonny to ensure that the Train 7 Project\u2019s commitments were delivered.\n\nHowever, NCDMB, the country\u2019s local content agency, declined to comment on the matter as its corporate communications personnel did not respond to an enquiry sent to him as of the time of filing in this report.\n\nPeter Uzoho",
