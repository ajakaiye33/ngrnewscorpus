A single mask made of fabric cannot achieve the purpose of droplet protection because droplets will get absolved in that fabric and the person will still get exposed to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of question whether a single layer mask is effective or not. Of course, wearing a mask is better than not wearing it at all but whether wearing a fabric mask protects you against COVID-19, everybody knows it is not true because the degree of exposure is overwhelming as the country is no longer in lockdown and people are now going out freely.\n\n\u201cIn a single day, you are exposed to more than six people that have had COVID-19 knowingly or unknowingly. So, the emphasis right now is for people to get vaccinated, we have gone past the stage of limiting exposure. Hand hygiene and mask-wearing are not enough. They can help at the individual level but at the population level, hand hygiene and mask-wearing is not the answer for us as a country. They are to act as supportive measures but they are not the answer because no matter how you maintain hand hygiene and mask and when you go out, the level of exposure is too much and the emphasis is for you to get vaccinated because, in the end of the day, that is what we bring protection for everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expert, however, stressed that fabric masks offer better protection against COVID-19 if they are double-layered or multilayered compared to single layers of cloth\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is here to stay and whether we like it or not, everybody is going to have it. It\u2019s not that the mask doesn\u2019t work anymore but the degree of exposure is simply too much for that to be the primary mode of protection. So, we need to get vaccinated and keep using a face mask and maintain hand hygiene.\n\n\u201cRight from time, fabric masks have not really been very useful, so if they are doubled and people wear them properly, it\u2019s better than nothing at all but the multilayered mask is better,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari during a special interview with Channels TV. PHOTO: YouTube\n\nSays request ill-informed\n\nBy Chris Ochayi\n\nABUJA: The Arewa Youth Federation, AYF, yesterday, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to disregard call for the sack of the Director General of the National Intelligence Agency, NIA, Mallam Ahmed Rufa\u2019I, saying the request was ill informed and ill motivated.\n\nConvener of AYF, Comrade Kabiru Muhammed argued in a statement while reacting to the position expressed by the Arewa Youth Groups, said the appointment of the DG NIA is the exclusive prerogative of the President who has all the security information at his disposal to make informed decision as to who to be appointed in any position in the country most especially in the security formations.\n\nREAD ALSO:HP, police close down counterfeiting facilities in major seizure\n\nAYF noted that, President Buhari is determined to end insurgency, banditry and other forms of criminality in the country. He knows who to appoint within the security architecture to drive his vision of a secured Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cWe wonder if the Arewa Youth Groups thinks the job of the DG of NIA is a political appointment where they expect the DG to come to the press and reel out his achievements.\n\n\u201cFor avoidance of doubt, the National Intelligence Agency oversees foreign intelligence and counterintelligence operations.\u201d\n\nThe Arewa Youth Federation which has been involved in peace building across the North East and North West stated that the call is ill timed and sponsored by the enemies of the country to distract the NIA at a time tremendous success is being recorded in the war against insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\nThe security architecture in the country is witnessing the most formidable Inter agency collaboration which the NIA is driving it. This collaboration has witness the killing of senior BokoHaram/ISWAP leaders, arrest of informants and logistics suppliers of the terrorists. Thousands of terrorists have surrendered to the Military in the last few months.\n\n\u201cWe are tempted to believe that the Arewa Youth Groups is sponsored by enemies of the country and war against insurgency. If not what other explanation do they need more than the explanation by the National Security Adviser Major Gen. Mungonu that the appointment of Ambassador Ahmed Rufa\u2019i Abubakar as the NIA DG met the provisions of the National Security Agencies Act 1986 ( Cap 278 LFN).\n\n\u201cArewa Youth Groups must understand that security issues are not discussed in the press. Rather intelligence is gotten, analyzed and appropriate actions taken. Ahmed Rufa\u2019i remains the most effective DG of NIA.\n\n\u201cIt is curious that all along, the Arewa Youth Groups or their sponsors have remained silent until now that it is evident that the security agencies are on the last lap of winning the war against insurgency and banditry.\n\n\u201cKnowing very well that this war is driven by effective intelligence gathering, they have come up with such attack and frivolous allegations against the NIA which is leading in intelligence gathering.\n\nThe Convener concluded that the latest attack on the DG, Ahmed Rufa\u2019i is an unnecessary distraction that Mr. President must reject. The focus and determination amongst the security agencies and formation must be sustained to win the war against insurgency.",

These conditions addressed legal registration of operations, taxation and managing prohibited publication in line with Nigerian laws. Twitter has agreed to meet all the conditions set by the FGN.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the FGN and Twitter have decided on an execution timeline, which has started this week.\n\n\u201cOur engagement with Twitter opens a new chapter in global digital diplomacy and sets a new operational template for Twitter to come back stronger for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe following are the resolutions agreed with Twitter. Inc.:\n\n\u00b7 Twitter has committed to establishing a legal entity in Nigeria during the first quarter of 2022. The legal entity will register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The establishment of the entity is Twitter\u2019s first step in demonstrating its long-term commitment to Nigeria.\n\n\u00b7 Twitter has agreed to appoint a designated country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The Global Public Policy team is also directly available through a dedicated communication channel.\n\n\u00b7 Twitter has agreed to comply with applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law.\n\n\u00b7 Twitter has agreed to enroll Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals. The Partner Support Portal provides a direct channel for government officials and Twitter staff to manage prohibited content that violates Twitter community rules.\n\nAt the same time, the Law Enforcement Portal provides a channel for the law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian Laws. Taken together, these represent a comprehensive compliance apparatus.\n\n\u00b7 Twitter has agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation has been built and work with the FGN and the broader industry to develop a Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries.\u201d\n\nInuwa said the suspension of the ban will take effect from the midnight of January 13th, 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cTherefore, the FGN lifts the suspension of the Twitter operations in Nigeria from midnight of 13th January 2022. We encourage all users of the Twitter platform to maintain ethical behaviour and refrain from promoting divisive, dangerous, and distasteful information on the platform.\n\n\u201cAs patriotic citizens, we need to be mindful that anything illegal offline is also illegal online and that committing a crime using a Nigerian Internet Protocol (IP) is synonymous with committing a crime within our jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a Nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe FGN is committed to working with Twitter to do anything possible to help Nigerians align and navigate Twitter algorithmic design to realise its potentials while avoiding its perils.\n\nInuwa gave insights into why the government imposed the ban and what Nigeria and Twitter had gained from the resolution of the spat.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou may recall that on 5th June 2021, the FGN suspended the operation of Twitter through an announcement made by the Honourable Minister of Information and Culture, Alh Lai Mohammed. Thereafter, the President constituted a seven-man Presidential Committee to engage Twitter Inc. Subsequently, in its wisdom, the Presidential Committee set a 20-member Technical Committee comprising all relevant government agencies. The Technical Committee engaged and worked directly with the Twitter team.\n\n\u201cThe immediate and remote cause of the suspension was the unceasing use of the platform by some unscrupulous elements for subversive purposes and criminal activities, propagating fake news, and polarising Nigerians along tribal and religious lines, among others.\n\n\u201cThese issues bordering on national security, cohesion and the effects of the abuse of the Twitter platform forced the FGN to suspend the operation of Twitter to address the direct and collateral issues around its operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe new global reality is that digital platforms and their operators wield enormous influence over the fabric of our society, social interaction and economic choices. These platforms can be used as either a tool or a weapon.\n\n\u201cEvery nation is grappling with how to balance its usage efficiently. Without balancing, every citizen\u2019s security, privacy, social well-being, and development are at stake. Therefore, our action is a deliberate attempt to recalibrate our relationship with Twitter to achieve the maximum mutual benefits for our nation without jeopardising the justified interests of the company. Our engagement has been very respectful, cordial, and successful.\n\n\u201cThe process of resolving this impasse between the FGN and Twitter Inc. has helped lay a foundation for a mutually beneficial future with endless possibilities. Twitter is a platform of choice for many Nigerians ranging from young innovators to public sector officials who find it helpful to engage their audience.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our engagement will help Twitter improve and develop more business models to cover a broader area in Nigeria. Furthermore, the FGN looks forward to providing a conducive environment for Twitter and other global tech companies to achieve their potential and be sustainably profitable in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nInuwa, who praised Nigerians for their perseverance while the ban lasted, said the gains of the engagement with Twitter were immeasurable.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile appreciating all Nigerians, especially the vibrant Nigerian youths who have borne with the long wait to resolve this impasse, the FGN is happy to say that the gains made from this shared national sacrifice are immeasurable.\n\n\u201cSome of the gains include:\n\na) On-going economic and training opportunities as the Company continues to consider expanding its presence in Nigeria;\n\nb) Getting a better understanding of how to use the Twitter platform effectively to improve businesses;\n\nc) Revenue generation from the operation of Twitter in Nigeria;\n\nd) Smooth and coordinated relationship between Nigerian Government and Twitter leading to mutual trust;\n\ne) Reduction of cybercriminal activities such as terrorism, cyber stalking, hate speech, etc.; and\n\nf) Working with Twitter and other global companies to build an acceptable code of conduct following the global best practice.\u201d",

He ruled the political terrains of Ogbomoso, nay Oyo State from 1996 until he died.\n\nIncidentally, his death came exactly one month after the passing on of the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oladunni Oyewumi and few days after the death of Professor Taibat Bolanle Danmole, the eldest daughter of the late Soun.\n\nIndeed, death has been so cruel to the people of Ogbomoso. Losing three big \u2018trees\u2019 in one month is to say the least very sad!\n\nOtunba Alao-Akala was an Ogbomoso man through and through. He would prick his ears on the mention of Ogbomoso. He was ready to stake his life for Ogbomoso\u2019s cause. No wonder he had cultic followers in his home town, Ogbomoso.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe left this world the very day he became governor of Oyo State and the day that Ogbomoso monarch joined his ancestors, that is, the12th day of the month.\n\nDeath has been felling many big trees. Oyo State has lost four monarchs in recent times; Soun Jimoh Oladunni Oyewumi, Asigangan of Igangan, Onigbeti of Igbeti and Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji. So also is former Oyo State Commissioner of Women Affairs, Professor Taibat Bolanle Danmole, nee Oyewumi and now, former governor of the state, Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala.\n\nOne commiserates with the governor of Oyo State, Oluwaseyi Abiodun Makinde, the good people of Oyo State and the immediate families of the departed.\n\nEvery mortal would die even if one is surrounded by weapons but the death of Akala is bad on the eve of general elections in Nigeria because he would have played major roles. Surely, politics in Ogbomoso will not remain the same. We hope it won\u2019t take long to have another political iroko in Ogbomoso. \u201cDum vivimus, vivimus\u201d.\n\nAdelani Olawuyi,\n\nObada (Odooba), Ogbomoso.",

          "text": "Olawale Ajimotokan\n\nThe federal government of Nigeria has lifted the ban on Twitter effective from 12 midnight of January 13, 2022.\n\nThis comes exactly 214 days after the government suspended the Twitter in the country.\n\nThe lifting of the ban was announced Wednesday in a statement issued by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and the Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdulahi, who said the approval was granted following a memo written to the President by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim, after the social networking platform agreed to respect Nigeria\u2019s laws and culture.\n\nThe NITDA DG said, Pantami in the Memo, updated and requested the president\u2019s approval for the lifting based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cThe federal government directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12am tonight, 13th January 2022.\n\n\u201cYou may recall that on 5th June 2021, the FGN suspended the operation of Twitter through an announcement made by the Honourable Minister of Information and Culture, Alh Lai Mohammed.\n\n\u201cThereafter, the President constituted a seven-man Presidential Committee to engage Twitter Inc. Subsequently, in its wisdom, the Presidential Committee set a 20-member Technical Committee comprising all relevant government agencies. The Technical Committee engaged and worked directly with the Twitter team,\u201d\n\nAbdulahi explained in the statement.\n\nThe federal government had suspended Twitter\u2019s operation in the country on June 5, 2021, after the social media platform deleted some tweets made by the president which it had perceived were not appropriate.\n\nHowever, Abdulahi said the ban was lifted after Twitter agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation had been built.\n\nIn addition, he said the company has agreed to collaborate with the federal government and the broader industry to develop a Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries.\n\nOther conditions which Twitter accepted included committing to setting up an establishment in the country in the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe company would register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), with the establishment of the entity being Twitter\u2019s first step in demonstrating its long-term commitment to Nigeria.\n\nAlso, Twitter has agreed to appoint a designated country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities as well as complying with applicable tax obligations on its operations under the Nigerian law.\n\nThe statement stressed that Twitter has agreed to enroll Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals, which provides a direct channel for government officials and Twitter staff to manage prohibited content that violates Twitter community rules.\n\nThe federal government said the Law Enforcement Portal provides a channel for the law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian Laws.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the FGN lifts the suspension of the Twitter operations in Nigeria from midnight of 13th January 2022.\n\n\u201cWe encourage all users of the Twitter platform to maintain ethical behaviour and refrain from promoting divisive, dangerous, and distasteful information on the platform.\n\n\u201cAs patriotic citizens, we need to be mindful that anything illegal offline is also illegal online and that committing a crime using a Nigerian Internet Protocol (IP) is synonymous with committing a crime within our jurisdiction,\u201d Abdulahi said.\n\nHe described government\u2019s action as a deliberate attempt to recalibrate its relationship with Twitter to achieve the maximum mutual benefits for the nation without jeopardising the justified interests of the company.\n\n\u201cThe new global reality is that digital platforms and their operators wield enormous influence over the fabric of our society, social interaction and economic choices. These platforms can be used as either a tool or a weapon. Every nation is grappling with how to balance its usage efficiently. Without balancing, every citizen\u2019s security, privacy, social well-being, and development are at stake. Therefore, our engagement has been very respectful, cordial, and successful,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the process of resolving the impasse between the federal government and Twitter has helped lay a foundation for a mutually beneficial future with endless possibilities.\n\nHe described Twitter as a platform of choice for many Nigerians ranging from young innovators to public sector officials who find it helpful to engage their audience\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Shonekan died yesterday in Lagos of natural causes, his family said. He was aged 85 years.\n\nA statement by the family, signed by one of his children, Adeboye Shonekan, said, \u201cTo the glory of the Almighty, the Shonekan family announces the passing of our patriarch, loving husband to Margaret, dutiful father to us all and former Head of State, Chief Ernest Adegunle Oladeinde Shonekan, GCFR, CBE, the Baba Sale of Egbaland.\n\n\u201cHe passed this morning of natural causes at the age of 85. The family will release further details in due course.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari said he received the news of Shonekan\u2019s passing with sadness. In a release by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, on behalf of the federal government, Buhari extended deepest condolences to Shonekan\u2019s wife, Margaret, loved ones, as well as the government and people of Ogun State.\n\nThe president paid tribute to Shonekan, saying though an internationally respected statesman, with courageous wisdom, he left his flourishing business to become the Head of Government at a delicate time, when the country needed someone of his calm mien and pedigree to save the ship of state from sinking.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo said Shonekan was a unifying force that helped to bind the country together at a time of great uncertainty.\n\nFormer military president Ibrahim Babangida, who had appointed Shonekan head of the interim government, extolled his sterling qualities, saying they qualified him for the tough job.\n\nEx-President Goodluck Jonathan, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, and All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, were also among prominent Nigerians who paid tribute to the departed leader.\n\nBuhari said Shonekan demonstrated to all that his love for country and commitment to its development, peace, and unity transcended the trappings of office and the transient nature of political power.\n\n\u201cBuhari believed that Nigeria owes a great debt to Chief Shonekan, the peacemaker, who even at the twilight of his life time never stopped believing and working for a prosperous and democratic country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe president prayed that the memory of the departed would remain a blessing to Nigeria even as he finds perfect peace with the Almighty God.\n\nBuhari Directs National Flag to Fly Half-Mast for Shonekan\n\nThe president directed that the national flag should be flown at half mast from January 12 to 14 as a mark of respect for the former Head of State. Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, announced the directive in a statement last night.\n\nObasanjo: He Was a Unifying Force for Nigeria\n\nObasanjo, yesterday, described Shonekan, as a unifying force for the nation.\n\nObasanjo, who was on an international assignment as the High Representative of the African Union for the Horn of Africa, said he received with great shock the news of the death of one of Africa\u2019s illustrious sons. He declared that Shonekan\u2019s contribution to the growth and development of democracy in Nigeria could not be forgotten in a hurry.\n\nObasanjo sent a condolence letter to the wife of the deceased, Mrs. Margaret Shonekan, copy of which was made available to newsmen in Abeokuta by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi. In the letter, the former president said the late business mogul was \u201ca role model and an epitome of the good in the nation\u2019s business firmament of mixed blessings.\n\n\u201cHe would be remembered as a man of sustained strong will to succeed. Coming from humble background, rising, stepping and peaking at the topmost plum in corporate management, and the very top of the giant United Africa Company (UAC) ladder, attest to his sagacity, tenacity and steadfastness.\n\n\u201cHe founded, in 1994, the Economic Summit Group, an advocacy group and think tank for private sector-led development of the Nigerian economy, and it remains, till today, sustaining the legacy of helping to support stakeholders in the execution of policies, programmes and strategies in response to any emerging trends in national and global economies.\u201d\n\nOn the political scene, Obasanjo noted that Shonekan, as head of the ING in 1993, which was short-lived for three months through the palace coup orchestrated by General Sani Abacha, \u201crendered outstanding service to our country, and we will never forget that.\n\n\u201cIt is also worthy of note that as Special Envoy on the Implementation of the Abuja Agreement on Zimbabwe in 2001 under my administration as the President of Nigeria; and Chairman, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) under Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s administration in 2008, he was forthright, dedicated and showed great patriotism in the discharge of his duties.\n\n\u201cHe was a unifying force for the nation and his contribution to the growth and development of democracy in Nigeria cannot be forgotten in a hurry. In all situations, he lived nobly and he died in nobility. He was an achiever.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Chief Shonekan died at a time the country is in dire need of his leadership, wealth of experience and wisdom to tackle the multifaceted challenges facing the nation.\u201d\n\nIBB: Why I Made Shonekan Head of Interim Government\n\nFormer military president Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, while mourning the passing of Shonekan, also explained why he appointed him head of the interim national government, when he stepped aside as military president.\n\nIBB, as Babangida is called, said Shonekan was a man of ideas and ideals, who was prudent and preached a lot about fiscal discipline. \u201cIt was, therefore, timely for us to appoint him as Head of the Interim Government to help stabilise the polity at a most trying period of our country\u2019s political evolution.,\u201d Babangida stated\n\nIn a condolence message, Babangida expressed shock over the news of Shonekan\u2019s death and described him as one of Nigeria\u2019s finest brains and patriots.\n\nBabangida said, in a statement, \u201cI hadn\u2019t the faintest idea that Chief Ernest Shonekan would depart this sinful world too soon, even at 85. He was a man, a leader and an uncommon patriot, who had a presence of mind and whose understanding of Nigeria was profound and remarkable. It is, indeed, a personal loss to me.\n\n\u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was one of our cerebral minds during our time in government. He was the architect of our principle of free market economy, which helped to open up the system for a robust participation by the private sector. The liberalisation of the economy, the investment and boost in the agricultural sector and budget management approach were part of his brainchild.\n\n\u201cI recollect very vividly how he used to give us tutorials on budget, planning and management of national resources, each time he was invited to our session. At each budget year, Chief Shonekan would be invited to critique our budget proposals, and gave us further input to enrich the final budget. He was a man of ideas and ideals. He was prudent and preached so much about fiscal discipline.\n\n\u201cIt was, therefore, timely for us to appoint him as Head of the Interim Government to help stabilise the polity at a most trying period of our country\u2019s political evolution. He was a calm personality, whose managerial skills were foretold in the way and manner he managed a lot of blue chip companies.\n\n\u201cAs Head of the Interim Government, he was able to consult with a broad spectrum of the Nigerian populace in charting a roadmap out of the political impasse at that time. His brilliance and meticulous interrogation of situations helped in large measure to forge ahead during the period.\n\n\u201cI owe a personal gratitude to him throughout his sojourn on earth as we maintained very robust mutual relationship after his exit from the corridors of power.\u201d\n\nThe former military president added regarding Shonekan, \u201cGiven the achievements we recorded during our time in government in the area of infrastructure, economy and social rebirth, I owe a word of gratitude to him for his experienced intervention in helping to dissect our policy frameworks each time we called upon him to do so.\n\n\u201cHe was an engaging personality, whose sense of patriotism was total. He was friendly and sociable. He understood economy and made so many projections that helped us to bail the country out of economic conundrum. We benefited from his immense knowledge, experience and brilliance.\u201d\n\nJonathan, Atiku, Ayu Mourn, Pay Tributes\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, and National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, joined other Nigerians to mourn the passing of Chief Ernest Shonekan.\n\nJonathan, in a condolence message to his family and the government of Ogun State, described Shonekan as \u201can elder statesman, well-loved for his sincerity and sense of purpose.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, Chief Shonekan was well-respected, because of the enormous goodwill he brought into governance. He was a compassionate and determined administrator, a peacemaker and bridge builder, who stepped in to lead the nation at a very difficult time in the history of its political evolution.\n\n\u201cBefore he assumed office as the head of the Interim National Government in 1993, Chief Shonekan had become a boardroom guru, having established himself as a foremost industrialist and one of the leaders of the business world.\n\n\u201cHe left enduring legacies, part of which was his considerable effort towards mainstreaming the private sector in the development drive of the nation, especially, with the institutionalisation of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), which he founded.\u201d\n\nJonathan said Shonekan would be remembered for his great wisdom, peaceful disposition, the goodwill he extended to all, as well as his significant contributions to the growth of the economy of the nation.\n\nAtiku said, in his own message, \u201cIt is with a sad heart that I received the news of the death of the former Head of State and Chairman of the defunct Interim National Government, Chief Earnest Shonekan.\u201d\n\nIn the statement he personally signed, Atiku stated, \u201cMy grief is predicated, not just on the demise of the elder statesman, because he died at a prime age,\u201d but on his exit at a time, when the country needed his skills and global connections find solution to its multifarious challenges.\n\nThe former vice president stated, \u201cEither as a politician or a boardroom guru, Chief Shonekan possessed a unique set skill of bringing stability to a tumultuous situation. That obviously was the consideration that made him become Head of the Interim National Government following the crises that greeted the events after the June 12 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAlthough his reign as Head of State was interim, Chief Shonekan\u2019s contribution to the peace and development of Nigeria in those days and latter years, remains enduring.\n\n\u201cMy condolences go to his immediate family, the people and government of Ogun State and the entire nation for the loss of a man of industry and intellect, who lived a life of service to the country and humanity. It is my prayer that God Almighty receives his soul in a peaceful repose.\u201d\n\nAyu, while condoling with the federal government, the government of Ogun State, and the family of the departed corporate giant, described Shonekan as \u201ca detribalised Nigerian and elder statesman, who gave Nigeria his best.\u201d\n\nThe PDP chairman also said of Shonekan, \u201cHis death is a sunset on an illustrious career that straddled both the corporate sector and the public service. We are consoled that he lived a fulfilled life, and that his legacy of public service will outlive him.\u201d\n\nLawan: He\u2019ll be Remembered for Heeding Nigeria\u2019s Call to Duty\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, yesterday, said Shonekan would be remembered for heeding the nation\u2019s call to duty at a critical time.\n\nLawan, in a statement, condoled with Shonekan\u2019s family and the government and people of Ogun State over the death of the former Nigerian leader.\n\nThe senate president\u2019s message read, \u201cMy condolences go to the family of Chief Shonekan, the government and people of Ogun State and entire Nigeria over this great loss. Chief Shonekan was a lawyer, business captain, boardroom guru and statesman.\n\n\u201cBut he will be most remembered for heeding the nation\u2019s call to duty at a very turbulent period in the history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan\u2019s services as Chairman of the Transitional Council and later as Head of the Interim National Government were selfless and contributed greatly to saving the Nigerian ship from hitting the rock\u201d.\n\nAbiodun: His Death is a Colossal Loss\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, described the death of Shonekan as a huge loss. Abiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, lamented that Shonekan, a former chairman of UAC Nigeria Plc., passed on at a period Nigeria needed his experience most as a technocrat.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cChief Shonekan was a first-class administrator, boardroom guru and astute leader, whose imprint in the business and political firmaments cannot be erased. His commitment to peaceful resolution and patriotic fervour will live after him.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan, an Egba traditional chief (Babasale of Egbaland), was a true Nigerian, who spent most of his life for the betterment of the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor lamented the huge vacuum created by Shonekan\u2019s death.\n\nTinubu: He\u2019d Have Led Nigeria Same Way He Led UAC\n\nNational leader of APC, Bola Tinubu, yesterday, said were the circumstances of his ascension to power different, Shonekan would have led Nigeria the same way he led the United Africa Company (UAC).\n\nTinubu, in his condolence message, released by his media office and signed by Mr. Tunde Rahman, commiserated with Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, Shonekan\u2019s widow, Mrs. Magret Shonekan, and the people of Ogun State over his passing.\n\nThe APC leader stated, \u201cI received with great sadness the news of the passing of the former Head of the Interim National Government, Chief Shonekan, at the advanced age of 85. I join his immediate family in mourning his passing, but also in celebrating his lifelong contributions to our great nation.\n\n\u201cWith his passing, the country has lost another important elder-statesman; a man of peace, who tried to bring unity and concord during one of the nation\u2019s most trying moments.\n\n\u201cChief Ernest was a technocrat and boardroom guru. He performed excellently as Chairman of United African Company, a vast Nigerian conglomerate. Indeed, were the circumstances of his ascension to the top position in our country different, I have little doubt that Chief Shonekan would have led Nigeria with the same vision and skill with which he guided UAC.\n\n\u201cHe had the character, competence, capability and the technical background to undertake the job. In his brief time as Head of State, Chief Shonekan tried his best to advance peace, stability and development in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan will be remembered as a peacemaker and Head of State, who took office at a most difficult time. I commiserate with his immediate family, most especially, his loving wife, Mrs. Margret, Governor Dapo Abiodun, and all the people of Ogun State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu: He was Committed to Nigeria\u2019s Peace, Unity\n\nChairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, called Shonekan a nationalist, who was committed to the nation\u2019s peace and unity. in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Richard Olatunde, Akeredolu described Shonekan\u2019s death as a huge loss to the country, noting that the vast experience of the elder statesman was an asset to the country, particularly, with the array of challenges confronting Nigeria.\n\nThe governor said Shonekan was committed to the peace and unity of the country, and pursued it with vigour and dedication as a patriot. He said the service of the former Head of Interim National Government would never be forgotten in the country\u2019s history.\n\nAkeredolu stated, \u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was a nationalist per excellence. His belief in a united and peaceful Nigeria was unparalleled. He was dedicated to the progress and development of the county. He will be sorely missed.\n\n\u201cHis historic and patriotic role in maintaining the unity of the country was one of the many things that endeared him to many. He was, indeed, an asset; his counsels were useful for national cohesion and progress.\u201d\n\nWike: Shonekan Boasted Topnotch Administrative Credentials\n\nRivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, while mourning the passing of Shonekan, said his excellent administrative credentials helped in steering the ship of the country at a very critical time.\n\nIn his condolence massage, signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, Wike also described Shonekan as a dedicated Nigerian, who was committed to the peace and stability of the country. He said Shonekan\u2019s strong credentials as an astute administrator enabled him to steadfastly steer the country through one of its most turbulent times.\n\nWike said in the message, \u201cOn behalf of the government and good people of Rivers State, I offer our deepest condolences to the family, relatives of the former Chairman, Interim National Government and the people of Nigeria.\u201d The governor said Nigeria had lost an elder statesman whose wisdom, foresight, and steadfast commitment would always be remembered.\n\nUzodimma: in Shonekan, Nigeria Lost a Patriot\n\nImo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said the death of Shonekan was painful, stressing that the country has lost a great patriot.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary and Media Adviser, Oguwike Nwachuku, Uzodimma said Shonekan was one of Nigeria\u2019s statesmen and legal luminaries, who believed in the unity, progress and development of the country and actually worked hard in private and public sectors for the realisation of that dream.\n\nUzodimma added that Shonekan\u2019s legacy at the United African Company (UAC) would always speak volumes. He said Nigerians would not forget his contributions in a hurry.\n\nWhile regretting that the country had lost a boardroom icon, when his fatherly and statesman pieces of advice were highly needed, Uzodimma specifically commiserated with his widow, Mrs Margaret Shonekan, the entire Shonekan family, his friends, and the government and people of Ogun State over the loss.\n\nOn behalf of his family and the people of Imo State, the governor also condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigerians over Shonekan\u2019s death, and prayed God Almighty to grant the soul of the deceased a peaceful repose, and those he left behind him, the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\n\nPDP: Shonekan, a Bridge-builder; His Death, a National Tragedy\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, mourned the death of Shonekan, describing him as a bridge-builder, and his passing, as a national tragedy.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Shonekan, PDP said Shonekan was a courageous, humble and patriotic leader. The opposition party said the departed leader was a bridge builder and an extraordinary statesman, who dedicated his life and made immense sacrifices to ensure the unity and stability of the country in the heat of the political crisis that threatened the corporate existence of the country following the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election.\n\nThe main opposition party said Shonekan was an accomplished personality and a visionary leader, whose efforts in applying his vast experience as a consummate lawyer and businessman to reposition the nation, despite the daunting challenges faced by his three-month regime between August and November 1993, could not be forgotten.\n\nPDP said, \u201cChief Shonekan\u2019s commitment to the entrenchment of democracy was evident in his determination to restore the rule of law and transparency in governance.\n\n\u201cEven outside office, Chief Shonekan remained committed to the unity, stability and development of our nation. Our party grieves that he left the stage at the time the nation needed his wealth of experience and wise counsel the most.\u201d\n\nPDP commiserated with the federal government, the government and people of Ogun State, and the Shonekan family, praying God to grant the nation and the bereaved family the fortitude to bear the huge national loss.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s One of Last Generation of Pioneer Business Leaders\u2019\n\nStakeholders in the private sector, yesterday, reacted to the passage of Chief Earnest Shonekan and described him as one of the last generation of pioneer business leaders in Nigeria, who contributed immensely to the growth of the various sectors of the economy.\n\nPresident, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), Dr. Al-Mujtaba Abubakar, said Shonekan\u2019s demise was a \u201cbig loss to the private sector.\n\n\u201cHis was a life well spent; a life of extraordinary achievements from the boardroom to the highest office in the land.\u201d\n\nExecutive Director, Nigeria Private Sector Alliance (NiPSA), Mr. Nwiabu Legborsi Nuka, said, \u201cNigeria has lost a leader of repute and builder of businesses\u201d.\n\nIn the same vein, former Director General, ACCI, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, described Shonekan as an enigma in the corporate world, having served on the boards of many blue chip companies as chairman.\n\nEkechukwu said, \u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was an enigma in the corporate world, as he served on the boards of many blue chip companies as Chairman. He distinguished himself as a role model for directors of companies on what running private sector boards should look like.\n\n\u201cIt was on the strength of these leadership qualities that he was appointed an Interim Head of State in Nigeria. Some of the board structures set out by him are still in place today. He will be missed by the corporate world. May his soul rest in peace. Amen.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Eromosele Abiodun\n\nThe battle to retain its service boat contract in the pilotage district of Lagos, Warri, Bonny, Port-Harcourt and Calabar, which expired on August 8, 2020, may not be over yet as INTELS Nigeria Limited yesterday said it does not consider the process of awarding the Pilotage contract closed.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement in reaction to THISDAY exclusive report, which revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled the restoration of INTELS service boat contract with the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), the company stated that it was yet to receive any form of communication from any quarters on the matter.\n\nINLTELS argued the service boat contract was being carried out by it for over a decade with excellent results both in terms of the service rendered and the revenue generated in favour of the NPA and by extension, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe reasons for this position are based on three fundamental points: the first is that INTELS is relying on a freezing order issued by the Federal High Court, which confirmed the continuity of operations of the pilotage activity even after the date of 8 August 2020, based on the clear wording of the agreement between the parties. It is also the subject of a pending arbitration.\n\n\u201cThis continuation is in the best interest of the country, the NPA and the managed clientele, especially given the ability of INTELS to oversee the pilotage districts/revenue centres for the NPA, thus guaranteeing the certainty of monitoring all the movements generated. This has resulted in a significant and constant financial benefit for the NPA.\u201d\n\nThe second point, the statement added, was about the debt ratio between IINTELS/affiliate and the NPA.\n\n\u201cAs is well known, INTELS/affiliate is owed over $700 million by the NPA, the repayment of which is guaranteed by the pilotage agreement through a mechanism of repayment of part of the revenues received by INTELS as agent and paid to the NPA.\n\n\u201cThis mechanism has worked perfectly well even after August 2020 and therefore it is not clear why it should be discontinued, to the benefit of other competitors that have no claim on the NPA, placing the NPA itself in a state of default that is difficult to sustain before international markets, economic operators and stakeholders, \u201cINTELS said.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe third, and perhaps most important point is that the NPA would receive an immediate benefit of $100 million from the proposed settlement by INTELS, a very substantial amount, as a result of the debt write-off that INTELS is prepared to grant to the NPA if the proposal is accepted.\n\n\u201cTo this amount would be added approximately a further $300 million, representing a change in the current contractual debt interest rate of 6.5 per cent to 3 per cent per annum. That is, approximately $20 million per year for the 15 years set out in the settlement proposal.\n\n\u201cAt this point the question arises, who takes responsibility at whichever level to waive an economic benefit of such magnitude that would provide an enormous boost to the NPA\u2019s budget and resolve years-long dispute with costs and expenses that could be allocated to other initiatives? It remains to be seen whether common sense and the country\u2019s interests will prevail in this case as well.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported yesterday that President Muhammadu Buhari had upon receiving communication from the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Director General Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), and Acting Director-General, Infrastructure Concession and Regulatory Commission (ICRC), who unanimously advised the president against the restoration of the contract, reversed his January 2021 directive to restore the contract.\n\nThe president, in a letter addressed to the AGF and the Minister of Transportation, with reference number: SH/COS/23/A/229, dated January 7, 2022, and singed by the Chief of Staff (COS) to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, seen by THISDAY, had directed that the procurement process initiated by the procuring entity, NPA, that was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Transportation be forwarded immediately to the BPP for action.\n\nThe COS in the letter had stated: \u201cThe president has also directed that upon receipt of the No-objection approval from the BPP, a memorandum be presented by the Ministry of Transportation to the Federal Executive Council for consideration, that the Ministry of Transportation should ensure that the process is concluded within 60 days of the president\u2019s directive to avoid further loss of revenue by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThat NPA should ensure that the sanctity of the agreements with respect to Onne 4 (Berths 9, 10 & 11) be maintained, as there is no subsisting contract with INTELS for their utilisation.\u201d\n\nBuhari had also directed the AGF to ensure quick determination of the cases in court in view of their economic importance, stressing that the above set of directives prior approval dated January 22, 2021 granted on the matter.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Tarneem Saeed: The entrepreneur at the forefront of Sudan\u2019s economic renaissance",
          "text": "She left law in the UK, returned to Sudan, and built the largest online marketplace in the country. Now, she\u2019s building the biggest fintech startup in the country. How\u2019s Saeed doing all of this in Sudan, one of Africa\u2019s most conflict-torn political landscapes?\n\nIn the media, Sudan is often portrayed as an unstable country. In October last year, it made the news again; this time, not for the civil unrest that has engulfed the Northeast-African nation for the past 40 years but for alsoug, a marketplace startup in the country, which closed a $5 million institutional funding round.\n\nThis investment is the first of its kind since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period. So, it isn\u2019t only a big deal for the startup but for the entire ecosystem. It is a milestone that marks the beginning of a new era for business in Sudan.\n\nalsoug, founded in 2016 by Tarneem Saeed, is reportedly the biggest tech startup in the country; the funding round speaks to this fact. What is surprising, however, is that, in a conservative and conflict-torn nation like Sudan, a woman-led company is at the forefront of bringing Sudan\u2019s economy back to health.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTarneem Saeed and founding alsoug\n\nSaeed left Sudan for the first time when she was 14. Her father was a successful Sudanese businessman and her mother a top professional in the humanitarian space. At the time, the Sudanese educational system had gone to a shambles, so Saeed\u2019s parents decided to ship her and her brother to Canada, to study. From Canada, Saeed proceeded to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) where she studied law and served as the president of the Arabic Society.\n\nShe worked as a corporate lawyer at Allen and Overy, a global law firm present in over 60 countries, for 4 years. In 2014, she took a sabbatical to visit Sudan to help a family friend put together a collection of coffee table books focused on Sudanese\u2019s artists.\n\nUpon getting to Sudan and staying a few days, she began to see how backward the country was digitally.\n\n\u201cSudan felt so cut off from the world. It was like in the 1990s; people and businesses weren\u2019t harnessing the full power of the internet. Coming from London, Sudan just felt really empty,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cOne thing that irked me the most was how difficult it was to find out the price of anything. You had to ask someone to get the price of a car, house, and even cattle.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Saeed. Sudan has a staggering 64% of its population under the age of 24 and boasts a mobile penetration rate of 73%\u2014so, why was it still digitally in the 1990s?\n\nSaeed decided to do something about it. Throughout 2015, she and her small team were building a broker platform where people could check the prices of goods and services. In 2016, alsoug was launched as a classified marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe chose the classifieds model because Sudan was quite unstable and the internet wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Saeed. \u201cThe beauty of the online classifieds platform, however, is that it doesn\u2019t require heavy tech, and you can do a lot on it while keeping costs fairly low.\u201d\n\nTarneem Saeed, founder/CEO of Alsoug\n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the telecommunication companies present in Sudan were in survival mode. They were cutting operation costs and not reinvesting in the country. As a result, the country\u2019s tech got old and any mass digital product had to be light so that people could access it with their 2G and not-so-strong 3G.\n\nalsoug continued as a classified platform where people would go to check out the price of things\u2014as Saeed had envisioned it\u2014and connect with sellers. Saeed and her team took to the streets to onboard offline merchants, educating them about alsoug\u2019s value. The team also doubled down on SEO since they couldn\u2019t advertise on social media because Facebook won\u2019t allow them to target Sudan. After a while, the platform started picking up momentum.\n\nAfter the success of the classifieds model, Saeed\u2019s thesis that Sudanese aren\u2019t suspicious of tech and would embrace it, if provided, was now proven, and it was time for alsoug to pivot into a scalable business model\u2014where the platform facilitates more than just discovery but also payments and fulfillment.\n\nA big problem is a big opportunity\n\nalsoug has pivoted into a marketplace that facilitates an entire e-commerce value chain, but there\u2019s a problem: there aren\u2019t any existing digital payment options to plug into. \u201cThere was no M-Pesa or Paystack,\u201d Saeed said, so the company couldn\u2019t process payments online and had to settle for cash on delivery.\n\nAfter using this model for a while, the company realised that they\u2019d have to build their own payment gateway. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time they\u2019d build supporting tech from scratch: Saeed said they\u2019d earlier built their own SMS tool after a series of terrible experiences with some third parties.\n\n\u201cSo, we started looking into building our payment gateway, obtaining licenses, and talking to potential partners. Then we met Ashraf Sabry Fawry CEO and some other key shareholders, who convinced us that if we were going into the payment space, we\u2019d have to spend more money,\u201d said Saeed.\n\n\u201cWe realised we could build a payment network across Sudan. We decided to raise capital, but we were keen on bringing in adventurous VCs with high ethical standards who\u2019d understand that doing business in Sudan is a long-term play. It took a while to close, but it\u2019s worth the time.\u201d\n\nalsoug now has a payment gateway called Cashi that facilitates payments on its marketplace; and the company is also on the brink of rolling out its POS machines across the nation. What started as a buyer-seller matchmaking site has morphed into a full-blown e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe alsoug roadmap is very ambitious. However, building as a woman in Sudan is a tough call. This is not only true for Sudanese women, it\u2019s the reality of every female founder across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are places I can\u2019t go to and have to rely on male employees to go there. For example, I can\u2019t go to the car market because it\u2019s a male-dominated market and women aren\u2019t taken seriously there.\u201d\n\nAlsoug team at work\n\nSaeed also narrated how in most meetings with regulators or government officials, they directed their questions to her male employees rather than her. She, however, isn\u2019t deterred by this because instead of taking it as an insult, she\u2019s turned it into fuel driving her ambition. She said one way to look at it and not feel disrespected is to consider that Sudan is majorly an Islamic environment where it\u2019s believed that men should lower their gaze.\n\nAccording to Saeed, the company has managed to capture the biggest market share because of their operational strategy. Though there are some Arab marketplaces competing with them, they are not bothered. Over the years, a number of companies have come, launched, and then shut down within a short period of time. Before anyone knew what was happening Sudan had eaten them up whole and spit them out of its borders.\n\nThe Sudan market is tough, and what helped alsoug was building light as they grew; they didn\u2019t try to overweigh the market all at once. Now the market trusts them to deliver even on other fronts\u2014like fintech.\n\n\u201cNo one has managed to penetrate the offline market and sustain growth the way we have. We have gone from people throwing us out of their shops to them coming to us,\u201d Saeed said with a faint giggle. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand. For example, real estate brokers thought we\u2019d come to steal their jobs, but when we encouraged them to get on the platform, they realised an increase in their sales exponentially in the course of a year.\u201d\n\nalsoug has used its empathetic offline education to turn competitors into customers and partners not only in the marketplace section, but also in the fintech division. According to Saeed, the company is not trying to compete with the banks, telecoms, and the budding fintech ecosystem; it just wants to fix the black holes by playing in a space where none of them is playing. \u201cDigital cash in and cash out,\u201d she said.\n\nSudan in retrospect\n\nTo really understand how much of a hard ground Sudan was and still is to do business in, a little context is necessary.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa: it has a landmass the size of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, and Rwanda put together. But unlike other nations who have since moved on from their civil war days, Sudan is still stuck on hers.\n\nSince 1956 when Sudan first gained independence from the UK, there\u2019ve been only 11 years of peace. The initial attempts to build a parliamentary democracy in Sudan was met by coups in 1958 and 1969. However, in 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement enforced a peace agreement between the government and separatist southern rebels.\n\nIn 1983, another civil war broke out when the military regime tried to impose Sharia law as part of its overall policy to \u201cIslamicise\u201d all of Sudan. The policy was pushed back by a rebel force called Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army from the south.\n\nThis event marked the end of the 11 years of nationwide peace but didn\u2019t mark the beginning of the conflict-laden nation that we know today. What turned Sudan to a bonafide hotspot, therefore, was the 1989 coup led by Omar al-Bashir, a politically and religiously extreme military leader.\n\nThe then ruling government and the southern opposition were reaching a compromise, but al-Bashir overthrew the government and declared himself chief of staff, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces\u2014positions he occupied for 30 years until 2019 when he was forced to resign.\n\nThe al-Bashir administration, in 1990\u201391, supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This made Bill Clinton to blacklist and isolate the country, and christen it a rogue state. Clinton also prohibited US investment in the country and reportedly sponsored neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions.\n\nA little over 2 years since al-Bashir vacated the seat, the country is still in a mess. Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister installed to take the country back to democracy, resigned last week. The resignation that came amid further political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests has derailed the country\u2019s fragile transition into democratic rule.\n\nFor 50 years, the political landscape in Sudan has been everything but stable and peaceful.\n\nThis seems like a lot but no Sudanese story will be complete without the mention of years of horrific governments that performed a tribal cleansing on its people, starved and killed children, raped women, and rendered its citizens homeless in their country.\n\nSaeed returned to Sudan in 2014, the same year the international criminal court suspended its case with al-Bashir\u2014after two unsuccessful arrest warrants\u2014because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSo, when Saeed says that \u201cif anybody built a thriving business in the midst of this persistent chaos that is Sudan, it is the alsoug team,\u201d she is right because it has been done and all the facts are there.\n\nThe vision that drives alsoug is bigger than any bottleneck. Apparently, the same passion that drives the CEO is what drives her employees\u2014building a company that makes life easy for every Sudanese and ushers the country into a prosperous era.\n\nalsoug has positioned itself as the answer to Sudanese intra-country commerce. It has provided a platform to sell and buy; an infrastructure that powers payment; and a logistics arm that fulfils last-mile delivery\u2014the three arms of commerce.\n\nSaeed is giving entrepreneurs in the country\u2019s nascent tech ecosystem and some government officials a fresh set of beliefs in building reputable businesses in the country. However, this is just the beginning because Saeed doesn\u2019t want alsoug to just be a champion in Sudan but also become a household name in Africa, like M-Pesa in Kenya, Flutterwave in Nigeria, Wave in Senegal, and even their major backer, Fawry in Egypt.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigerian startup SeamlessHR, which provides payroll and HR software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for medium to large-sized companies in several African countries, has closed a new $10 million Series A round.\n\nAfrica-focused VC firm, TLcom Capital led the round while some of SeamlessHR\u2019s existing investors participated once again, such as Lateral Capital and Enza Capital. Other investors in this round include Capria, Ingressive Capital, and a number of strategic private investors. The new funding brings total investments secured by the startup to $12.2 million, having previously raised $2.2 million seed in October 2020.\n\nWith the funding, SeamlessHR plans to further grow its team of 130 as it eyes a pan-African expansion with new South Africa and Kenya offices being mulled. The company also plans to add new product functionalities around artificial intelligence and HR data analytics, it said, in addition to a new embedded finance product currently being piloted.\n\nSeamlessHR started in 2013 as Insidify.com, a jobs aggregator with a recruitment management system that matched employers to job seekers. That was until its co-founders Emmanuel Okeleji and Deji Lana realised job sites could \u201cdo little to address the fundamental causes of unemployment in Africa,\u201d the former told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nAfter several iterations, the founders made a strategic pivot, relaunching in 2018 as an enterprise-grade, cloud-based HR and payroll management SaaS. SeamlessHR is currently used by hundreds of companies in Nigeria, Ghana, and Tunisia, including renowned brands like PwC, Flutterwave, Sterling Bank, TGI Group, Lagos Business School, AXA, and Chapel Hill Denham, according to the company. More than 100,000 employees from these organisations use SeamlessHR monthly.\n\n\u201cThanks to our customers, we have become the leading cloud HR and Payroll SaaS in Africa in such a short time,\u201d CEO Okeleji said. \u201cWe currently serve most of the medium to large-sized businesses [including ten Nigerian banks and five insurance companies] in countries where we\u2019re concentrated, with Nigeria being our focus market.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSeamlessHR is part of a cohort of startups that are reinventing the administrative stack in organisations. Others include YC-backed Workpay and Bento. But the company has some product advantages compared to other solutions and appears to be a market leader.\n\nFirstly, companies in some cases typically install \u201ccore HR\u201d software while they run payroll using another package or in-house. Switching from one siloed solution to the other can be incredibly hard. SeamlessHR\u2019s holistic solutions prevent this as its cloud platform enables client organisations and their people to automate and optimise the entire HR process, from recruitment to retirement. In addition to the core HR management system, it offers different tools to track analytics as well as manage performance and competency, employee recruitment, leave, and payroll.\n\nOkeleji also pointed out the user-friendliness of SeamlessHR, which has enabled it to capture some market share from other HR management SaaS providers, particularly foreign players Oracle and SAP. \u201cSome systems are so complex to use that you need to be certified. For SeamlessHR, it\u2019s user-friendly enough to understand with just one training during the onboarding,\u201d he said.\n\nWill Poole, Managing Partner at Capria notes that SeamlessHR is addressing the needs of African enterprises in \u201cways that the global giants can\u2019t compete with by building customer-centric SaaS designed from the ground-up to address complexity unique to the continent.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, SeamlessHR has a big market opportunity as every large company needs an HR and payroll solution. There\u2019s also a growing appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations that wish to digitise their workplaces. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026. \u201cFor a company that has 20 employees, HR software is a nice to have. But if you have 600 employees, then you have a pain that we solve,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nAfter capturing the Nigerian market to a significant extent and growing headline revenue 3x year-on-year (except in 2020 due to the pandemic-induced economic slowdown), the startup has now set its sights on companies in other African countries.\n\nBut finding the right talent remains a key problem. In addition, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent, according to Okeleji. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger and we\u2019d have a lot more customers and can charge higher prices.\u201d\n\nTo expand its client base, the CEO does not rule out expanding SeamlessHR to markets outside of Africa but notes that for now, the focus is on Africa and the team isn\u2019t \u201cdistracted\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is only the beginning. We are committed to customer success and this funding will enable us to invest in the continuous optimisation of customer experience across all touchpoints, adding new features and functionalities starting from Q2 this year,\u201d Okeleji said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Unchecked ambition, lax regulations: The genesis of predatory digital lenders in Nigeria",
          "text": "Ebuka Anyaeji thought he had seen it all, so when he first received a threat message about being a guarantor to a debtor on the run, he dismissed it as a joke, a message sent by an angry creditor to the wrong phone number. But the messages (WhatsApp and text) kept coming in; then Anyaeji found out his friends were also getting the same.\n\nLater on, the harassment moved from messages to phone calls\u2014real-time and pre-recorded calls. The content of the messages transitioned from just informing him that someone was owing the creditor money to threatening to embarrass him if he didn\u2019t get the defaulting debtor in question to pay.\n\n\u201cThe messages typically went along this line: \u2018This person is owing us money, and you\u2019re one of his guarantors. Tell him to pay or else we\u2019ll embarrass both of you\u2019,\u201d Anyaeji told TechCabal. \u201cIn some instances, they mentioned the amount of money owed, which was surprisingly low\u2014about \u20a610,000 ($17.8) or \u20a630,000 ($53.6)\u2014or in other cases they just referred to the debtor as a chronic debtor or fraudulent individual.\u201d\n\nOut of the numerous messages he\u2019s gotten, there\u2019s been only one occasion where he knew the debtor being referred to\u2014a university mate. What did he do about this case? He didn\u2019t bother informing the person, because they weren\u2019t close.\n\nA screenshot of Anyaeji\u2019s Whatsapp chat.\n\nFor Anyaeji, who now occasionally dishes out witty responses to the senders of these messages just for fun, he wonders why the debt collection practices of digital lenders like Soko Loan, LCash, 9Jacash among others use shaming tactics and, more importantly, whether this new trend would continue unchecked.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this\n\nThere is no doubt that Africans have embraced taking loans through digital-lending apps. They are discreet, quick to access, and require no collateral. But this also means lenders who use the repayment habits of users to gauge their creditworthiness\u2014and never physically meet their customers\u2014often struggle with loan repayment.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t always been like this in Nigeria. Loans were primarily issued out by traditional banks, who rarely ever gave out loans without the backing of collateral or guarantors.\n\nIn the case of a loan default, before it ever gets to the point where a defaulting debtor\u2019s collateral is seized, there are a number of checks put in place. First, loans are given only after credit checks have been run and the account relationship manager can vouch for a potential borrower. When a borrower defaults, the account relationship manager first reaches out to the lender to find out the reason, and even visits to confirm. Guarantors and referees are also contacted, if need be.\n\n\u201cAs long as both parties are open and transparent, penalty charges don\u2019t come in yet. Until when they\u2019re past due obligations, which is typically over 90 days,\u201d an employee of a Nigerian bank, who spoke under anonymity, told TechCabal.\n\nOftentimes, while the account officer is following up with the defaulting customer, the monitoring team and even bank directors can also check up on the defaulting customer. The conversations typically revolve around ascertaining the repayment ability of the customer, restructuring the loan to extend the tenure and possibly waiving off penalty charges.\n\nIf all efforts to reach a reasonable agreement or recover the debt fail, the bank reverts to possessing the item\u2014usually a house or car\u2014used as collateral. This is a last resort that the bank isn\u2019t keen on exercising, another banker told TechCabal. \u201cWe detest having to possess people\u2019s lands or houses, which serve as collateral; the bank is not into real estate,\u201d he said.\n\nHow did lending apps come into the picture?\n\nFor a long time, Nigerian banks preferred to lend to businesses and not individuals. This led to the rise of new lenders like Carbon (formerly Paylater), Renmoney, and Branch that have filled the gap by offering quick loans through smartphone apps.\n\nTemi Sodipo, a credit risk analyst recalls the early days when there were only a few prominent Nigerian digital lenders like Renmoney and Paylater. But, as the years went by, new digital lenders popped up at different corners. People were at first skeptical but, over time, consumer confidence grew.\n\n\u201cI remember in late 2017 when we disbursed \u20a61 billion ($1.8m) in loans at Renmoney, we had a party to celebrate. In early 2019, when we issued \u20a64 billion ($7.3m) loans, it was just a normal month,\u201d he said.\n\nWith more digital lenders coming into the space, Sodipo believes that, despite the fact that many claim they\u2019re getting more people financially included, most digital lenders serve the same set of people because the terms for accessing the loans are similar. The terms include a six-month-long bank statement, verifiable government ID, employment letter, or work email verification.\n\nHe believes this has created an avenue for a few ambitious players who wanted a slice of the market to become lax with their rules. Some digital lenders even started giving out loans to people with bad ratings on credit bureau\u2014an obvious red flag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder why they turn to desperate debt collection measures as they contend with a high rate of default. It\u2019s simply bad underwriting and not paying attention to basic credit risk principles,\u201d Sodipo said.\n\nCommercial banks also started dishing out instant loans\n\nIn 2020, at least half of the 22 existing Nigerian commercial banks started offering instant loan products without collaterals, something that was unheard of years ago. What was the driver of this move? A new directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nIn July 2019, the CBN announced an increase in the required minimum Loan-Deposit Ratio (LDR) of commercial banks to 60% from 57.64%. At the end of September, it further increased the LDR to 65%. LDR stipulates the volume of loans a bank must give out as a percentage of its total deposit. In the case of 65% LDR, it meant that if, for instance, a bank has \u20a6100 billion of customer deposits, it must have at least \u20a665 billion issued as loans. The increase was done to encourage commercial banks to issue more loans to individuals and businesses in order to stimulate the economy.\n\nTo avoid the sanctions that came with not meeting the LDR, these commercial banks began offering instant loan products without collaterals at risk of high repayment default rate. When debtors defaulted, the banks, however, unlike digital lenders, responded differently to the defaults.\n\nA source familiar with this incident told TechCabal that, unlike the digital lenders, these big commercial banks can afford to introduce these types of loans and make a loss on them, considering that they make tens and hundreds of billions of naira in profit.\n\nIn addition to being able to absorb the loss, the CBN issued a directive\u2014the Global Standing Instructions (GSI) policy\u2014that gave banks the right to deduct the amount owed from the bank account of the loan defaulters in other banks, in order to reduce the amount of non-performing loans\u2014a move that reduced the chances of defaulting customers owing while having money with other banks.\n\nOptions available to digital lenders\n\nCurrently, digital lenders don\u2019t have the right to debit the accounts of loan defaulters in other banks via GSI, so they rely on automated card debits, repayment reminders, and reporting customers to the credit bureau as a last resort. But do these methods work?\n\nJulian Flosbach, CEO of BFree, an ethical debt recovery company, believes they do if they consider the reasons customers default as well as their current financial situation. According to flosbach a majority of borrowers default because they lose their jobs, their business fails, or due to health emergencies that change the financial affordability of customers. He believes that assessing the new financial abilities of a customer and offering new repayments plans via convenient communication channels can then increase the repayment rates from these customers significantly.\n\nAn employee at a digital lending company explained that reporting to the credit bureau could be effective at times. She cited a case of a defaulting debtor whose application visa was denied because he failed to repay his loan for over a year. Credit checks are a prerequisite for issuing visas in some countries.\n\nShe also affirms Sodipo\u2019s point about an influx of lenders with lax rules by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s typically companies not registered with the credit bureau that use unethical debt collection practices.\u201d\n\nSlow and steady doesn\u2019t win this race\n\nIt\u2019s clear that digital lenders involved in unethical debt collection practices do so because of their unchecked ambition and the convenience of operating outside the law.\n\nFortunately, a number of governing bodies are beginning to do something about these digital lenders. In August 2021, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine (a questionable small amount) on Soko Lending Company, one of the digital lenders which repeatedly contacted Anyaeji.\n\nA few months later, in October, Google took down a number of predatory loan apps from its Play Store for violating its policies. Despite these actions, the pace of the response from Nigerian regulators is slow when compared to Kenya, where in December a new law was put in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nIf victims like Anyaeji and his friends would ever be free from the disturbance and intimidation from these predatory digital lenders, Nigeria\u2019s regulators would have to increase the pace of their response.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

ANKA was founded in 2016 to fill that gap. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly completed over $35 million in transactions, with over 80% of its retailers being women.\n\nCyberattacks in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dan Nelson on Unsplash\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you don\u2019t lose any sleep over potential cyberattacks. Yet, organisations across the globe face numerous cyberattacks daily.\n\nAccording to the cybersecurity firm, Check Point Research, the fourth quarter of 2021 witnessed an astonishing rate of cyberattacks, with organisations seeing about 925 cyberattacks weekly. Their data for 2021 shows that the number of cyberattacks per week increased by 50% compared to 2020.\n\nThe sectors that saw the most attacks were the education/research sector, with government/military second. Of all regions surveyed, Africa had the highest volume of attacks, with organisations on the continent facing 1353 attacks weekly.\n\nAfrica is no stranger to cybersecurity attacks. In June 2020, Life Healthcare Group, a private hospital operator in South Africa was forced to switch to manual systems following an attack on its digital infrastructure. Similarly, an estimated $3.2 million was stolen in October 2020 as Uganda\u2019s telecoms and banking sectors were hit by a wave of cyberattacks.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nIt\u2019s less than two weeks away!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day\n\nOluwanifemi, here\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCrypto at AFCON\n\nTouch and Pay (TAP)\u2019s Cowry card\n\nCrypto ads at AFCON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Sky Sports\n\nThe African Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2022 kicked off on Sunday, January 9, in Cameroon. Although there have been multiple postponements, anticipation didn\u2019t quite wane. So far, four matches have been played, and many more are to come before the finale on February 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about sports, but I\u2019ve grown a liking for football, and I\u2019ve been conveniently drawn to foreign leagues, especially the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. Following the buzz around AFCON, I asked Emmanuel Paul if players were on an international break. \u201cApparently not,\u201d he replied.\n\nAfrica is a great exporter of talents, and this includes football. This means some foreign clubs would have to miss their players for some weeks. Well, my real worry was Chelsea having Kepa Arrizabalaga man the nets for its upcoming major matches\ud83d\ude10, instead of Mendy, who is off to make Senegal proud. Anyways, the entire situation was surprising since AFCON is one of the world\u2019s major continental tournaments, like Euros and Copa America.\n\nWant to know something even more surprising? Binance is a major sponsor for AFCON. Before expressing my main concern, I also found that Nigerian-founded payments startup, Flutterwave partnered with Afrosport TV, the cable channel that acquired AFCON broadcast rights. Cool, isn\u2019t it?\n\nSo, back to Binance. Getting the global crypto-trading platform on AFCON basically translates to legitimately allowing millions of Africans to see crypto ads on every matchday. The terms of the partnership involve having Binance adverts placed on the perimeter boards on all the stadiums hosting AFCON matches. 52 live matches!\n\nOh, the irony. I hope we\u2019re not quick to forget the hostility of African central banks and regulatory agencies toward digital currencies. One that readily comes to mind is the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) restricting cryptocurrency in Nigeria. Despite all that, Africa still tops the chart regarding peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platforms in terms of transaction volume globally. Source? 2020 and 2021 stats.\n\nRecall? Nigeria continues to lead crypto peer-to-peer transactions\n\nIt might not be convenient to argue that the football governing body for Africa, the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF), isn\u2019t aware of this apathy. Does this further confirm the suspicion that African governments, like many other countries, are comfortable with leaving the cryptocurrency sector unregulated only to clamp down on it occasionally?\n\nIt\u2019s not new. Between 2018 and now, more cryptocurrency and blockchain companies have gotten into sports worldwide. A crypto-trading platform, eToro is one of Europe\u2019s biggest football sponsors. Clubs like Tottenham Hotspur FC, Brighton & Hove Albion FC, Cardiff City FC, Crystal Palace FC, Leicester City FC, Newcastle United FC, and Southampton FC make the list. In fact, in 2021, Binance became the main jersey sponsor for S.S. Lazio, an Italian football club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto.com sponsored the US Superbowl for $700 million, and FTX has shelled out almost $150 million for the NBA\u2019s Miami Heat.\n\nBolu, our reporter covering cryptocurrency and blockchain, can enlighten you, our esteemed readers, about crypto use cases in sports. Only if you ask. Leave your request in the comment section.\n\nWhether this was an oversight or the sports body chose to look away from the hostility instead of losing investor funds, it seems sports is playing a good role here in supporting digital currencies in Africa. Well\u2026\n\nCashless bus rides with Cowry card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaying for bus fares with TAP\u2019s Cowry card\n\nHave you ever thought about paying for your bus fare with a bank card or transferring money to your bus conductor?\n\nWell, if you\u2019ve lived in Lagos for long enough, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s something that might never happen. Conductors like speed; they want transactions to be done on time and will even ask you to \u201center with your change.\u201d\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t have change or worse, you forget your wallet at home? Scenarios like this propelled Micheal Oluwole and Olamide Afolabi to start the company, Touch and Pay (TAP).\n\nTAP is the company behind the Cowry cards used to pay for bus fares on BRT buses. The cards are Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled, so payment can be made with a single touch.\n\nAccording to Oluwole and Afolabi, the idea behind TAP is to create something close to cash transactions as this is the best way to digitise transactions in the informal sector where cash reigns supreme.\n\nThey spoke to Bolu about how they got the Lagos deal, their ups and downs and some of the big plans they have for the future.\n\nRead all about it here: How Touch and Pay (TAP) got 1.5 million Lagosians to adopt cashless bus rides\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nY Combinator will now invest $500,000 in accelerated companies.

          "title": "Nigeria government lifts ban on Twitter after securing agreements",
          "text": "The Nigerian government has lifted the ban it placed on microblogging platform, Twitter, after about 8 months of freezing its operations in the country. The platform\u2019s operation is expected to come back at 12am, 13 January 2022.\n\nThe decision to lift the suspension was approved by President Muhammadu Buhari after the microblogging platform agreed to four resolutions requested by the Nigerian government.\n\nKashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), in a statement in Abuja, said the approval was given following a memo written to the President by Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim.\n\nRead more Explainer: What to know about pan-Africa payment system\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12am tonight, 13th January 2022,\u201d Kashifu said in a statement.\n\nHe added that the approval was given following a memo written to the President by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami. In the said memo the minister had updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nFollowing the ban on June 4, 2021, the federal government had listed several demands which Twitter must agree to before it is allowed to operate again in Nigeria. The demands include employing a designated country representative. The company representative must also have a physical address in Abuja and outside the capital city as well as access to the global management so that it can serve as the liaison between Nigeria and Twitter.\n\nTwitter is also expected to register with all relevant bodies and regulatory authorities like the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC). The government also wants Twitter to commit itself to work with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to enable local tax collection from the company.\n\nThe ban impacted the businesses of many companies that rely on the platform for various marketing needs. Top10VPN, a British company that reviews VPN usage, estimated that the ban on Twitter impacted around 104.4 million internet users in Nigeria with around $366.9 million lost in revenue. The company also utilised Netblocks and Internet Society to arrive at the calculations. The revenue loss placed Nigeria in the top three positions of countries with the most cost to revenue for putting a restriction on the internet. Myanmar and India are in the top two positions in terms of their losses.\n\nIn November 2021, Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, said correspondence between the government and Twitter had reached an advanced stage. The President had constituted a seven-man Presidential Committee to engage Twitter Inc.\n\nThe following are the resolutions agreed with Twitter. Inc.:\n\nTwitter committed to establishing a legal entity in Nigeria during the first quarter of 2022. The legal entity will register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The establishment of the entity is Twitter\u2019s first step in demonstrating its long-term commitment to Nigeria.\n\nTwitter has agreed to appoint a designated country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The Global Public Policy team is also directly available through a dedicated communication channel.\n\nTwitter has agreed to comply with applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law.\n\nTwitter has agreed to enrol Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals. The Partner Support Portal provides a direct channel for government officials and Twitter staff to manage prohibited content that violates Twitter community rules. At the same time, the Law Enforcement Portal provides a channel for the law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian Laws. Taken together, these represent a comprehensive compliance apparatus.\n\nTwitter has agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation has been built and work with the Federal Government and the broader industry to develop a Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the FGN lifts the suspension of the Twitter operations in Nigeria from midnight of 13th January 2022. Considering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a Nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter. The FGN is committed to working with Twitter to do anything possible to help Nigerians align and navigate Twitter algorithmic design to realise its potentials while avoiding its perils. \u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government cautioned all users of the Twitter platform to maintain ethical behaviour and refrain from promoting divisive, dangerous, and distasteful information on the platform. As patriotic citizens, we need to be mindful that anything illegal offline is also illegal online and that committing a crime using a Nigerian Internet Protocol (IP) is synonymous with committing a crime within our jurisdiction.",

          "title": "Tighter US monetary policy worsens outlook for Nigeria\u2019s economy \u2013 World Bank",
          "text": "The World Bank has predicted that any decision by the United States to tighten its monetary policy will have an adverse effect on the economic outlook of countries such as Nigeria.\n\nThe global financial institution was reacting to the statement on Tuesday by Jerome Powell, US Federal Reserve Chairman that the country\u2019s economy is both healthy enough and in need of a tighter monetary policy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, earlier this year, noted that it may need to raise interest rates from the current zero percent floor \u2018sooner or at a faster pace\u2019 than officials initially envisaged. Many informed observers now expect a four-quarter point interest rate rise this year along with the Fed selling some government bonds it owns.\n\nHowever, tighter monetary policy should not be confused with a highly restrictive monetary policy stance. The Federal Reserve indicated that a nominal interest rate of 1 percent would still stimulate demand, especially with inflation likely to be well above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target by the end of the year.\n\nThe problem for emerging/developing countries like Nigeria is that tighter, but still stimulative US policy might well spell trouble for them.\n\nIf last year served as any form of historical evidence, it revealed that advanced economies were more resilient than expected to Covid-19 waves. The Alpha and Delta waves, which were appalling for a large number of people\u2019s health, hardly dented global recovery. With increased monetary and fiscal stimulus that proved necessary, the resultant implication was excessive demand and surging inflation.\n\nThe start of 2022 depicted a frightening reflection of 2021\u2019s momentum. The new variant of the coronavirus (Omicron variant/Deltacron variant) sent infections rocketing through various parts of the world, threatening economic prospects for the year ahead. However, rather than a repeat of the severe downturns experienced in 2020/2021, the current outlook is one of high global inflation and rising interest rates with severe risks for emerging and developing economies like Nigeria.\n\nUche Uwaleke, a professor of finance and capital market and president of the Association of Capital Market Academics of Nigeria stated that Nigeria should expect further capital outflows as a consequence of the planned interest rate normalization in developed economies (the United States).\n\nRead also: Urging more reforms, World Bank stalls on $1.5bn support for Nigeria\n\nHe stated that the first implication would be that bond yields will rise leading to capital flow reversals in frontier and emerging markets. He further states that another implication would be the depletion of foreign reserves and a higher exchange rate of the naira as a result of exit of foreign investors which usually puts pressure on the forex market; thus providing further justification for the CBN to tighten monetary policy.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, banks are likely to reprise their assets which may worsen non-performing loans position in the Banking sector. This will increase the cost of borrowing and reduce access to credit by businesses,\u201d Uwaleke said.\n\nEmerging economies have struggled to recover as quickly as their advanced cousins, though lacking the same degree of trust and market access to borrow freely to protect their populations in the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nWithout financial resilience and generous social security systems, the downturns in emerging/developing economies have been more persistent than the weaker recoveries. The perfect storm was however completed by the difficulties these developing economies encountered in gaining access to vaccines and in their delivery to their populations.\n\nTwo decades of emerging economies catching up with their richer cousins have finally come to an end. The World Bank estimates that real incomes in 70 percent of emerging and developing economies will grow slower than those of advanced economies between 2021 and 2025.\n\nAlso, weakness during the pandemic is also likely to leave much larger and more persistent scars. The World Bank estimates that recovery in developing economies will fall by almost 6 percent short of the initial pre-pandemic expectations.\n\nThis would further limit their ability to service existing debts, which have risen by 10 percentage points of national income since the start of the pandemic according to the IMF (International Monetary Fund).\n\n\u201cThe anticipated rise in US interest rates and bond yields would further exacerbate the Nigerian government\u2019s expense at servicing its huge public debt which is currently in excess of N38 trillion,\u201d Uwaleke said.\n\n\u201cThis development will further worsen the country\u2019s current fiscal imbalance, jeopardize the 2022 budget as well as crowd out development funds,\u201d he added.\n\nThis is also likely to bring a hard landing, debt distress, and social discontent in weaker developing economies.\n\nNone of this would be made easier by the possibility that the Fed will hit harder on the brakes than expected this year, rattling markets and tightening global monetary conditions.\n\nThe President of the World Bank, David Malpass indicated that the prospects in 2022 are unlikely to be favorable for Developing economies.\n\nEmerging and developing economies are not alike in the conditions they face. For example, China has ample fire-power to cushion its economy in the short-term even if this comes at the expense of long-needed rebalancing.\n\nNigeria, however, is a prime example of a country vulnerable to a shock. High public and private debt alongside little credibility in its economic institutions is a very toxic mix. Countries in similar positions have already seen capital flight and face the threat of a vicious circle of increased vulnerabilities and weakening prospects.\n\nThe outlook, however, looks difficult as the World Bank expects 40 percent of emerging and developing economies to still have national income below the 2019 (pre-pandemic) level in 2023 and 2024. These are the conditions most likely to prompt a reckoning this year rather than further muddling through.",

          "text": "Oil and gas investments have been projected to expand by $26 billion this year on the back of new upstream gas and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) investments, energy research firm Rystad Energy has said.\n\nOverall oil and gas investments will rise by 4 percent to $628 billion this year from $602 billion in 2021 as the industry continues its protracted recovery from the worst of the pandemic and the hurdles imposed by the Omicron variant, it said.\n\nIn addition, it is also projected that these segments will be the fastest-growing in the current year, with a jump in investments from $131 billion in 2021 to around $149 billion in 2022.\n\nHowever, with the falls short of pre-pandemic totals, investments in the sector are expected to surpass 2019 levels of $168 billion in just two years, reaching $171 billion in 2024, the report noted.\n\nSpeaking on this development, Audun Martinsen, head of energy service research at Rystad Energy, said, \u201cThe pervasive spread of the Omicron variant will inevitably lead to restrictions on movement in the first quarter of 2022, capping energy demand and recovery in the major crude-consuming sectors of road transport and aviation.\n\n\u201cBut despite the ongoing disruptions caused by Covid-19, the outlook for the global oil and gas market is promising.\u201d\n\nRead also: High oil prices see World Bank upgrade Nigeria\u2019s growth\n\nAccording to Rystad Energy, upstream oil investments are expected to rise from $287 billion in 2021 to $307 billion this year which will represent a 7 percent increase, while midstream and downstream investments will fall by 6.7 percent to $172 billion this year.\n\nWhile sanctioning activity in North America is expected to pick up, with over $40 billion in projects scheduled for approval in 2022. Six LNG projects, five in the United States and one in Canada, are expected to be approved, according to the report.\n\nIn the same vein, the report also noted that Africa in 2022 is expected to be another quiet year, with projects worth a comparatively small $5 billion expected to be sanctioned.\n\nAccording to the report, when it comes to offshore field sanctioning, the global approvals pipeline for 2022 contains approximately 80 projects worth a total of $85 billion. Ten of these are floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) units, 45 are subsea tiebacks, and 35 are grounded platforms.\n\nRystad analysis also showed that Latin America and Europe will account for roughly 24 percent of total offshore sanctioning values next year, with deep water expansions expected in Guyana, Brazil, and Norway as a result of recent tax changes.",

Aside from the fact that we have two outlets on Admiralty Way, in 2022, we intend to have like two along Ajah Road.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to go to Ikoyi in Awolowo Road, and of course, to the Mainland by opening a branch in G.R.A, Ikeja.\n\n\u201cPresently, we have our presence in Dubai, we have places we want to open in Abuja and that is one of the reasons the MD is still in Abuja now. We spoke yesterday and day before on branches coming up in Abuja, so the expansion rate is going to be massive. It is going to be impressive for Foodies this year as we are poised to be known in every nook and cranny of Lagos.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if their focus is basically on the Island, Adeniji posited that being on the Island has not prevented their brand from being appreciated on the Mainland as they have had various orders from the Mainland.\n\nHe explains, \u201cPeople call from Ikorodu, some even call to ask for the address and we are on Admiralty Way, Lekki. I have one old woman who would always ask me to send moimoi to her in Festac and the cost of moimoi is just 400 Naira not minding the extra cost to transport it through Bolt to Festac.\u201d\n\nThe manager also revealed they presently have two outlets on Admiralty Way in Lekki, Lagos, two in Dubai, UAE, while one is fully operational, the other is set to take off soon.\n\nSpeaking about the uniqueness of the Food Brand, the manager said Foodies is founded on the concept of healthy living rather than just food.\n\n\u201c Foodies is one of the most recent fast food places that is taking care of people in terms of meals they eat. We don\u2019t only handle meals, we basically deal and and we are more conscious about meals people consume these days, you know, these days it is not just to eat but eating rightly at the right time.\n\n\u201cMost of the meals that we prepare are meals that are good for the body not meals that will be an issue to your body after consuming it, and aside from the fact that we take care of meals you can see the environment, the environment is wow! Foodies is like a home away from home. We tend to give a wow experience to people that come around us.\n\n\u201cWe do local, we do continental and intercontinental. When you talk about the local, people tend to come in and eat what they eat at home, it\u2019s as if you are eating from your house,\u201d he added.",

This is not the kind of story we want to hear as a people and as government.\n\n\u201cThe situation is not too good as far as the unwanton killings by all manners of criminals are concerned.\n\n\u201cI however believed that things can be turned around for better within the remaining one and half years left for this present administration , inclusive of the 9th National Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that though the armed forces and security agencies generally , have been putting in their best in curtailing the killing spree , but more efforts and results are still expected from them.\n\n\u201cIn supporting the security agencies for more potent war against the killers in the land , the National Assembly has appropriated over a trillion for security in the 2022 budget which will be monitored very well for desired results.\n\n\u201cIn achieving this, our relevant committees will ensure that procurement process is transparent and what and what projected to be bought or acquired are bought.\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the country is begging for more attention and it shall be given because that is the primary purpose of governance \u201c, he added.\n\nHe however stated that despite the security challenges in the country , the 9th National Assembly has collaborated well with the executive arm of government in giving dividends of democracy to Nigerians within the last two and half years.\n\n\u201cThe first thing done by the 9th National Assembly in this regards , was the restoration of the January \u2013 December budget implementation timeline , which has helped in stabilising the economy.\n\n\u201cThe 9th National Assembly based on legislative agenda set at both Chambers in June 2019, has also helped in stabilising the polity through results \u2013 driven harmonious working relationship with the executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mind whatever name being called now , our focus is on Nigeria and Nigerians and not unnecessary rivalry with any arm of government or even between the Senate and the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nOn borrowing, he said as long as expected revenues are not generated by agencies saddled with that purposes, so long will government be faced with challenges of borrowing.\n\n\u201cNobody likes taking loans or accumulating debts but can\u2019t be avoided as long as revenue generation is low.\n\n\u201cIn stemming the tide , aggressive engagements with various revenue generating agencies by relevant committees in the Senate , will take place on quarterly basis this year in meeting up and even surpassing targeted revenues for budgetary implementation.\n\n\u201cThe current status of low revenue to GDP ratio must be changed,\u201d he stressed.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

The approval was given following a memo written to the President by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cIn the Memo, the Minister updates and requests the President\u2019s approval for the lifting based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nTop Diplomatic Missions \u2018Disappointed\u2019 With FG\u2019s Twitter Ban\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter Ban Provokes Outcry\n\n70 Civil Groups Ask FG To Reverse Twitter Ban, Withdraw Prosecution Threat\n\nTwitter Blocks Trump\u2019s Ardent Supporter\u2019s Account\n\n\u2018Endless Possibilities\u2019\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe government and Twitter have been in negotiations since over restoring the service based on a set of conditions, including Twitter registering operations in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, Twitter has agreed to demands for working in the country.\n\nIt added that the committee set up by the Federal Government engaged with the Twitter team to engage resolve the impasse, adding that the resolutions will bring \u201cendless possibilities\u201d.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our engagement will help Twitter improve and develop more business models to cover a broader area in Nigeria.

But the presidency said the move had nothing to do with the social media platform\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cThere has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences.

The military also took over in Chad last year after President Idriss Deby died on the battlefield.\n\nNeighbouring governments have imposed heavy sanctions on the military rulers in Guinea and Mali in an effort to head off any contagion effect.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, Lassina Zerbo, a former UN official who was installed as the prime minister of the new government, has called for \u201ccohesion\u201d in the face of the armed threat.",
