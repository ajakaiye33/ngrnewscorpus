          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Sebastine Obasi\n\nNigeria\u2019s quest for massive indigenous participation in the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry has received a boost as Pacegate Energy and Resources Limited (PEARL), launched an ultra-modern manufacturing plant where drilling chemicals, water and oil-based production chemicals are formulated and manufactured in Nigeria and made accessible to clients.\n\nLocated at Ilupeju, Lagos, the plant was said to have been established in a bid to meet the growing needs of the oil and gas and transportation sectors of the Nigerian economy and Africa at large. This has been made possible by PEARL\u2019S partnership with global energy solutions provider, Canadian Energy Solutions (CES).\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo stated that there is need for innovative partnerships such as this to boost local content in Nigeria. \u201cI am pleased to formally commission the first local content fluids and chemical solutions manufacturing plant in Nigeria, which represents a significant landmark for the country\u2019s industrialisation programme.\n\nDomestication of products has been at the centre of this administration\u2019s industrialisation programme to drive job intensive growth of the Nigerian economy. It will increase local production, create job opportunity and improve our foreign exchange reserve position. I believe this will help in taking us ahead in our effort to diversify the economy and increase the contribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP. Most especially, the plant will provide jobs to Nigeria\u2019s workforce, promote local content, and save the nation the extra cost of importing the now locally produced input\u2019\u2019.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nAlso speaking, the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), represented by the General Manager, Project Authorisation and Certification, Paul Zuhumben, said, \u201cWe commend the efforts of Pacegate Energy Resource Limited for investing an installed capacity of 12.9 metric tonnes into the manufacturing of chemicals solutions aspects of the hydrocarbon value chain in Nigeria. At the beginning of local content implementation, the board had always emphasised that its focus will be on developing in-country capacity in manufacturing, fabrication, engineering and other high-end services supporting the oil and gas industry. This project by Pacegate speaks effectively to this\u201d\n\nGeneral Manager, PEARL, Franklin Oranusih said that the company was established out of a desire to solve industrial challenges with innovative solutions and partnerships. \u201cWe have a commitment to deliver quality and eco-friendly products as we continue to play our part in supporting local content in Africa. As the oil and gas sector continues to grow, it is expedient that we consider the effect it has on the environment, among others.\n\nThis partnership is a sign of our commitment and we are delighted to announce it. We also appreciate the support of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment and the Nigerian Content and Development Board \u2013 NCDMB for its support as we continue to fulfil this commitment.\u201d\n\nOranusih also stated that PEARL manufactures a wide range of chemicals and products such as Demulsifiers and Water Clarifiers, Corrosion Inhibitors, Scale Inhibitors, Biocides, and so on, while its technology partner, CES provides upstream chemical products bases.\n\nAccording to him, with PEARL\u2019s access to CES Energy Solution\u2019s global state of the art analytical and research and development laboratory capabilities as well as domain expertise for specialized test work, both companies will continue to conduct innovative research and development activities to provide site specific solutions across Africa.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026we no business with firearms, ammunition of any kind\n\nBy Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nThe Coordinators of the 64 Development Centers in Ebonyi State, yesterday threatened to sue the Senator representing Ebonyi North Zone, Dr Sam Egwu and other National Assembly members elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the State.\n\nThe institution of the suit against the PDP NASS members was because they alleged that they (64 Coordinators) were armed by the State Government to go after perceived political opponents in the State.\n\nThe Coordinators under the aegis of Forum of Coordinators were reacting to a statement credited to Dr Sam Egwu wherein he alleged that Governor Umahi was also using the Ebube-Agu security outfit to witch-hunt them.\n\nBut the Coordinator of Ikwo South East and Publicity Secretary of the Coordinators\u2019 Forum in the State, Hon. John Ogodo who read the communique on behalf of the 64 Coordinators, noted that they had no business whatsoever with firearms and ammunition of any kind, as alleged by the federal lawmakers.\n\nThe Forum vowed that if the National Assembly members led by Senator Egwu, failed to substantiate the allegations levelled against them, they would institute legal action against them for the false alarm, misinformation and integrity defamation.\n\n\u201cThat the present set of Coordinators of Development Centres in Ebonyi State have no business whatsoever with firearms and ammunition of any kind; even as we make bold to challenge Egwu and his group to make public \u2018real\u2019 pictorial, not photoshopped evidence of Coordinators of Development Centres and other youths wielding guns as they claim, as failure to substantiate same will leave Coordinators with no other option than instituting legal action against them for the false alarm, misinforming the public and integrity defamation.\n\n\u201cThat as Coordinators of our various Development Centres, who by virtue of our mandates are Chief Security Officers at that level, and who play a supervisory role on men of EBUBEAGU, we have never distributed guns to these hard-working young men of Ebonyi State (members of EBUBEAGU), who are sacrificing a lot in partnership with security agencies to ensure that every life and property in the state including that of members of National Assembly who are today raising false alarm, enjoys security in its true sense,\u201d the Forum said.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nThey further expressed dismay that an elder statesman like Senator Sam Egwu and his colleagues in the National Assembly were playing politics with the security challenges facing the country, instead of joining forces with Governor David Umahi to chart the best ways towards fighting insecurity in the State.\n\n\u201cThis attitude we see as irresponsible and a show of the fact that there are probably plans by the authors of the said press briefing to cause mayhem in the State which the presence of the Men of EBUBEAGU is now putting a clog in their wheel of progress.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised that at a time Senator Egwu should be agitating for and giving way for the youths to take over the affairs of governance he is busy forming groups to tarnish the good image of very young men and women who are mere Coordinators even when he has selfishly served as Commissioner for Education, two-term Governor, contested to be President of Nigeria and National Chairman of PDP respectively which both failed and afterwards appointed Minister for Education and now a Senator in his second term and still seriously asking for a third term.\n\n\u201cMr Senator Sir, If you succeed in destroying our reputations as you are trying to do, how are we going to grow to half your already attained height?\n\n\u201cThat we are not unaware of their gimmicks and serious campaign to blackmail the present government in Ebonyi State under the most competent leadership of His Excellency, Engr. (Dr.) David Nweze Umahi has gone through thick and thin to changing the Ebonyi narrative which has in turn taken away the mockery of asking Ebonyians to \u201csing the Lord\u2019s song in a strange land.\n\n\u201cThe attempt to also slander the person of the former National Vice Chairman of PDP, South East Zone, His Excellency, Deacon Austin Umahi (OCHIAGHA), is dead on arrival.

Why should herders from Katsina move?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2019The herders\u2019 movement is essentially in search of two things: water and fodder. If we can provide these two items why should they move?\n\n\u2018\u2019This roaming about I don\u2019t think. For us its un-Islamic and is not the best. It is part of the problem we are having today. I don\u2019t support that we should continue with the way open grazing is\u2019\u2019.\n\nRead Also: Presidency gets knocks for opposing open grazing ban\n\nOn devolution of power through restructuring, he argued States urgently need resources to implement what should have been implemented at the Federal level\n\nAccording to him: \u2018\u2019 I support devolution totally, the federal government is trying. But the states need to have resource to implement what should have been implemented by the Federal Government.\n\n\u2018\u2019If today the States will support the Police, the Police system will go up. If the states withdraw their support to security agencies, they won\u2019t be able to move from here to there.\n\n\u2018\u2019So, I absolutely support devolution in totality. So as a Government of Katsina we should be allowed by the Constitution, within the Constitution to decide on many things that are peculiar to us\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Federal Government should have a benchmark and people should not operate beyond this mark. Lagos State is generating up toN4bn and something billion, while Katsina State is just generating N2bn.\n\n\u201cI expect with proper restructuring, states should own the reflective of what they earns from within their State.\u201d",

If the economy is to grow, insecurity must be low. If not, the economy will suffer regardless of our efforts. But the chief of defence staff has assured us of security.

          "text": "\u2022Southern govs insist no land for invaders\n\n\u2022ACF maintains position on cattle restriction\n\n\u2022Buhari\u2019s opposition to southern govs, ill-advised, says Clark\n\n\u2022SANs allege ethnic bias\n\nBy Alex Enumah, Emma Addeh in Abuja, John Shiklam in Kaduna, George Okoh in Makurdi and James Sowole in Akure\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is opposed to open grazing of cattle, the presidency said yesterday in an apparent effort to douse the rising critique of its statement on Monday, quoting the president as querying the legality of Southern governors\u2019 ban on open grazing.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, while fielding questions on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said many people misconstrued Buhari\u2019s views on the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions at their May 11 meeting in Asaba, Delta State as an endorsement of open grazing.\n\nHours before the clarification from the presidency, the Monday statement had drawn flaks from the Southern governors; the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; and some senior lawyers.\n\nThe presidency statement by Shehu had questioned the legality of the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions, in which they, among others, banned open grazing of cattle in the South.\n\nThe statement quoted Buhari as dismissing the ban, while accusing the 17 Southern governors of not proffering any solution to the intractable farmer-herder conflicts, largely driven by open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe presidency announced Buhari\u2019s approval for ranching and revival of grazing reserves nationwide.\n\nBut the Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday fired back at the presidency, warning that no land in the South will be ceded to those he described \u201cas a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\u201d\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) also maintained its earlier stance that the ban on open grazing was in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nBut Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, yesterday kicked against the presidential decision to revive grazing reserves, saying that the reserves, created when Nigeria had a population of 50 million have since been taken over by airports, schools, roads, hospitals and other infrastructure.\n\nSome senior lawyers also faulted Buhari\u2019s opposition to the open grazing ban, alleging ethnic bias.\n\nHowever, in an effort to douse tension generated by his statement, Shehu told ARISE NEWS Channel that Buhari would want to see an end to the archaic practice of open grazing of cattle.\n\nHe added that the objective of the president and that of the governors fully align.\n\nHowever, he stated that the only difference between the positions of both parties is the approach to achieving the aim, adding that the president is insistent that it should be done in an organised manner.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president wants to see an end to open grazing; he wants to see ranching; but he wants it in a way that\u2019s organised and he has a plan for it and the plan will take off in June.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, all the ongoing attacks on the president are from people who are in the mood for a public fight.\n\nHe said states that were able to meet the minimum requirements would be encouraged to embark on ranching, and expressed optimism that those opposed to ranching will change their minds when it becomes fully functional.\n\nShehu said the president viewed open grazing as old-fashioned and was looking forward to a replacement for the medieval practice.\n\nBut he reiterated that banning open grazing without an alternative is not a good approach to the issue.\n\nHe said the president was worried about the crisis generated by the matter, adding that the generalisation of every herder as criminals is not the right thing to do.\n\nWhile admitting that the ranks of the nomads had been infiltrated with people now bearing AK-47 rifles to kill and maim, Shehu called for calm as the issue won\u2019t be solved by public show of strength.\n\n\u201cLet us stop this shadow boxing. You just brought one or two people here who said things that nobody said from our own end. Did the president say he didn\u2019t support\u2026? He\u2019s opposed to the way the governors have chosen to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn state policing, Shehu said the president was initially concerned that governors who are unable to pay salaries to their workers want to give guns to police set up by them, adding that if it is what Nigerians want, the president would have no option but to support it.\n\n\u201cYou hire a policeman. Give him a gun and for one year, you don\u2019t pay salaries, like you are doing to your teachers, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Shehu stated.\n\nBesides, he added that to implement state policing will require amending the 1999 Constitution, and Buhari has never rejected constitution amendments.\n\nOn restructuring, he stated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) wasn\u2019t against devolution of power, as that is the work of the legislature to do.\n\nHe also dismissed speculations that Buhari was interested in extending his tenure, saying that those raising doubts over whether or not elections will hold in 2023 are doing so because they are unelectable.\n\nShehu also said he was not aware of any shoot-on-sight order against Igbo, adding that the rumour is meant to provoke unnecessary public anger.\n\nSouthern Govs Insist No Land for Invaders\n\nThe Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday faulted Monday\u2019s presidential statement querying the legality of the governors\u2019 ban on open grazing.\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Special Duties and Strategies, Dr. Doyin Odebowale, said Shehu could not be representing the presidency with his positions on issues of national concern.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnyone who has been following the utterances of this man (Shehu), as well as his fellow travellers on the self-deluding, mendacious but potentially dangerous itinerary to anarchy cannot but conclude that he works, assiduously, for extraneous interests whose game plan stands at variance with the expectations of genuine lovers of peaceful coexistence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions are indigenous to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShehu cannot continue to hide under some opaque, omnibus and dubious directives to create confusion in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe declaration that the recommendations of the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, a mere political appointee like Garba Shehu, are now the \u2018lasting solutions,\u2019 which eluded all the elected representatives of the people of the Southern part of the country, exposes this man as a pitiable messenger who does not seem to understand the limits of his relevance and charge.\n\n\u201cMr. Garba contends that \u2018their announcement is of questionable legality\u2019, referring to the 17 governors of the Southern states, but the decision of certain elements to take the ancestral lands of other people to settle their kinsmen, including the \u2018gun-wielding \u2018killer herdsmen\u2019 and their families, and provide \u2018veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families, including schooling through these rehabilitated reserves\u2019 for which \u2018the federal government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side\u2019, does not appear to him as a comprehensive plan for land grabbing, a precursor to internal colonialism.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu said Shehu wanted to revive forest reserves \u201cbut seems particularly uninterested in the current position of the same law that he and his cohorts often misinterpret to serve parochialism and greed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernors no longer have powers over the lands in their territories. They must take instructions from appointees of the federal government on such matters,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhile noting the rights of all Nigerians to move freely in all parts of the country as guaranteed by the constitution, Akeredolu said it was clear that Shehu seemed to have issues understanding the difference between licentious criminality and qualified rights under the law.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is our duty to continually nudge him off his current state of cognitive dissonance. His pronouncement betrays dubiousness and mischief.\n\n\u201cMost traditional families in Nigeria have occupations. Pastoralism is not an exception. Any ethnic group still trapped in anachronism may be assisted to embrace modernity.\n\n\u201cDispossessing communities of their ancestral lands, encouraging denizens of the forests to overrun lands belonging to other people and forcing alien bands of migrants on the local populace to live \u2018side-by-side\u2019 with other communities cannot be for the purpose of animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cIt raises suspicion on a grand, deliberate, persistent and insidious design to use naked force to subjugate the real owners of the land. Mr. Garba Shehu is a major supporter of the current pervasive anarchy in the land.\n\n\u201cMay, we warn Mr. Garba Shehu and his cohorts to desist from hurling insults at the elected representatives of the people. He lacks the authority to make policy statements for the federal government, unless directed, expressly. His acts are clearly those of an agent provocateur.\n\n\u201cNo inch of the space delineated and known, currently, as South-west, and indeed the whole South, will be ceded to a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\u201d\n\nOrtom Condemns Moves to Reopen Grazing Reserves\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has condemned the moves by the presidency to reopen grazing reserves.\n\nThe governor said in a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, that he read with concern a statement issued by Shehu in which he said the federal government would commence rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country next month.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that there is a hidden agenda, which only the presidency knows. Otherwise, all the regions of the country have accepted the fact that open grazing of animals is no longer fashionable and should be banned to pave the way for ranching, yet, the government at the centre is insistent that grazing reserves/cattle routes must be created across the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nOrtom added that the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) had on February 9 agreed that open grazing was no longer sustainable, in view of growing urbanisation and population of the country.\n\nHe accused the presidency of pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of the 1950s and 60s, adding that the presidency\u2019s endorsement of open grazing has emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all land in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original landowners.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities,\u201d he added.\n\nACF Maintains Stand on Open Grazing Ban\n\nAlso reacting to the presidency\u2019s rejection of the ban on open grazing by the Southern governors, spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, said the Chairman of the forum, Chief Audu Ogbe, had earlier made the position of the forum known.\n\n\u201cOur stand on the issue was already made known by our Chairman, Audu Ogbe, in a statement he issued on May 17, 2021,\u201d he said while responding to THISDAY\u2019s inquiry.\n\nOgbe, in the statement, had said that the decision to ban open grazing was in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cACF does not see any reason to object to a decision taken in the best interest of all.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that the crisis emanates from the belief by most herdsmen that they are free to enter any farm, eat up the crops, and rape or kill anyone raising objections. Nobody or society can accept that.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said the presidential statement opposing the ban on open grazing showed that Buhari\u2019s government was not organised.\n\nThe Secretary-General of Afenifere, Chief Sola Ebiseni, said reacting to Shehu\u2019s statement again would amount to dignifying him.\n\nHe said: \u201cHaving reacted to the statement of the Attorney-General, I consider it infra dignitatem to still countenance Garba Shehu whose statement, claiming the president\u2019s authority, on the same ban on open grazing does not only show how unorganised the Buhari government is, but also a vote of no confidence on the AGF, who should save the honour of his office and the legal profession by resigning pronto.\u201d\n\nSANs Knock Presidency, Allege Ethnic Bias\n\nSome senior lawyers have faulted the position of the presidency on the open grazing ban in the South.\n\nSome of them described the president\u2019s statement as parochial, sectional and one that is capable of further tearing the country apart.\n\nMr. John Baiyesea (SAN), who described the statement as part of the bizarre situation the country is dealing with, wondered if such could ever emanate from Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, such statements are often made under the cover of the presidency.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is doubtful if the president knows about such annoying statements, which seem to suggest that he has narrowed his office to the North. I don\u2019t believe that the president will personally support one ethnic group against another or wilfully diminish the scope of his authority. I don\u2019t think he will make himself so irrelevant as president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that if the president\u2019s silence to such tribalistic and ethnic posturing of his appointees means acquiescence or approval, then the country is endangered.\n\n\u201cHow many times are they to be told (for them to understand), that freedom of movement guaranteed by the constitution is for human beings and not for cows, or animals?\n\n\u201cAs long as Fulani herdsmen stay within the law, their freedom of movement is guaranteed. But their cows do not enjoy the same constitutional rights or protections.\n\n\u201cExcept for the mischievous intentions of these government officials who are bent on dividing this country, it is too elementary that the constitutional system does not give the rights of people to animals,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, advised the federal government to be careful not to allow the horrors experienced in Rwanda and Burundi to happen in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN), faulted the presidency, saying that the Southern governors acted within the ambit of the law.\n\nHe added: \u201cI do not agree with him for the simple reason that it is not in tandem with my previously expressed view that the governors were right in their decision to ban open grazing.\n\n\u201cIn a constitutional setting as ours, the issue may have to be referred to the judicial arm of government for resolution. Until that is done, the governors are at liberty to stick to their position.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), also faulted the presidency and advised the government to study the Grazing Reserves Act of 1964, which provides for the establishment and operation of grazing reserves in the North.\n\nHe said since there was a popular demand for the proscription of open grazing, efforts should be made to immediately establish ranches.\n\n\u201cIt smacks of brazen official impunity on the part of the presidency to have said that the ban on open grazing is of doubtful legality. Last Friday, the Federal High Court ruled that state governments have the power to enact anti-grazing laws,\u201d he stated.\n\nConstitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), accused Malami of ill-advising the president against the stance of the Southern governors.\n\nHe challenged the federal government to sue the governors if it is convinced that their position is legally flawed\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buhari has obviously been ill-advised on the well thought out Southern governors\u2019 stance against open grazing by the attorney-general whose views were made known only two days ago. Buhari, with all humility, is quite wrong to say the Southern governors\u2019 stance is an act of questionable legality.\n\n\u201cIf the federal government feels strongly and sure about its puritanical, but legally flawed stance, I challenge the federal government to challenge the governors\u2019 resolutions by suing all the state governors of Nigeria, through the invocation of the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under section 232(1) of the 1999 Constitution\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

General Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 military officers and personnel.\n\nThe Kaduna aircraft crash, the third of such incident in the last three months involving NAF fleet, has raised concerns about the airworthiness of the aircraft the NAF has.\n\nThree NAF aircraft were involved in fatal crashes in Abuja, Borno and in Kaduna in the last three months, claiming the lives of a total of 21 personnel of the air force and the army.\n\nHowever, the air force, last week, inducted three newly procured JF-17 thunder aircraft into its inventory as part of activities to mark its 57th anniversary celebration and is expecting 12 Super Tucano fighter jets from the United State, which delivery is due by 2022.\n\nThere were also claims that of the four major Beechcraft planes in the force, notably, NAF 201, NAF 202, NAF 203 and NAF 204, two, NAF 201and NAF 203 had crashed in Abuja and Kaduna, remaining NAF 202 and NAF 204.\n\nThere have also been trending calls on the social media for the air force to ground the remaining two.\n\nBut the air force has insisted that the planes are in good conditions.\n\nThe air force, in a statement by its spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said the committee, comprising serving and retired officers, would, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations.\n\nThe committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures.\n\nThe committee, chaired by the Deputy Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai, Air Vice Marshal Abraham Adole, is expected to submit its report latest June 18.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, has constituted a committee of serving and retired senior officers to conduct a safety audit of all Nigerian Air Force (NAF) operational and engineering units.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations in the units.\n\n\u201cThe committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures. Chaired by Air Vice Marshal Abraham Adole, the Deputy Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai, the committee is to submit its report not later than 18 June 2021.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna air crash killed the army chief and officers from the army and the air force.\n\nBesides Attahiru, other senior officers who died in the crash were Brig General Idris Abdulkadir, Brig Gen Olatunji Olayinka, Brigadier General Abdulrahman Kuliya, ADC to the late COAS, Major LA Hayat, Major Hamza and Sergeant Umar Saidu.\n\nThe list of the crew members are Flight. Lt. T.O Asaniyi; Flt. Lt.

          "text": "\u2022CBN raises COVID-19 targeted credit facility to N400bn\n\n\u2022Mulls introduction of digital currency\n\nBy James Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday appealed to bandits and others involved in unlawful activities to drop their arms and embrace the central bank\u2019s Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP).\n\nHe also announced that the central bank has been encouraged to increase its COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility to N400 billion from N300 billion.\n\nEmefiele, while addressing journalists after a two-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja, also reiterated that cyptocurrency currently has no place in the Nigerian financial system.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the MPC resolved to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) otherwise known as interest rate at 11.5 per cent.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR and left the Cash Reserve Ratio at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, his appeal to criminals to embrace family is because there is a linkage between security and economic growth.\n\nResponding to a question, he said: \u201cIf you want an economy to grow, the level of insecurity must be low because if there is a high level of insecurity like what we see today, the economy will suffer.\u201d\n\nHe added that security agencies are doing their best to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cEfforts are now targeted at the south-eastern and north-eastern parts of the country. About three years ago, the federal government and the United States signed a pact that resulted in a government-to-government acquisition of military equipment.\n\n\u201cOut of which, we are expecting 12 fighter planes that would help us solve our insecurity. I am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of July and August.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, would like to appeal to our brothers, who decide that they want to live in bushes and forests, that they should please, begin to retreat, drop their arms and come and embrace the anchor borrowers\u2019 programme.\n\n\u201cIf they do so, it will help them; if they choose not to do so, they will be confronted by the security as this battle continues.\n\n\u201cI am optimistic before the end of the year that the security challenges confronting the country will substantially abate,\u201d he stated.\n\nEmefiele said the current targeted facility, which was unveiled to provide succour to households and SMEs amidst the harsh impact of the pandemic, \u201calmost the whole of N300 billion has now been disbursed.\u201d\n\nHe said the proposed increase would make more available to households and small businesses for them, \u201cto go back to business which will ultimately yield employment and also grow our economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated that the idea of operating a digital currency will soon become a reality in the country, adding that the central bank has already set up its committee, which is working on the concept.\n\nEmefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, said although the economy had successfully exited recession, the recovery was fragile given that the GDP of 0.51 per cent was still far below population growth rate.\n\nHe said the committee was therefore, of the view that, there was a need for monetary authorities to consolidate on all administrative measures taken not only to rein in inflation, but also on the actions so far taken to grow output.\n\nHe said in the committee\u2019s view, such measures should include boosting consumption and investments, as well as diversifying the base of the economy through FX restrictions for the importation of goods and food products that can be produced in Nigeria.\n\nThe MPC also urged the bank to continue to put in place measures that will boost export earnings.\n\nResponding to a question on the recent Q1 GDP figures, Emefiele said: \u201cI think it is important to say at the CBN we were not surprised. We were not surprised because Nigeria is one country that is peculiar for what I call a situation that is out of the ordinary. That is because Nigeria is one country among several others challenged by stagflation.\n\n\u201cStagflation is a situation where inflation is running high and prices are running high and at same time output growth is contracting. If you understand how this works, you will understand that as MPC, your core responsibility is to rein inflation by ensuring that you keep supreme your price stability mandate. And to do so means you have to tighten to rein inflation.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, government is confronted with contracting output and the normal way to recover from such is to stimulate the economy by injecting liquidity into the system.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said on consumption and investment, the committee noted that the intervention facilities under the anchor borrowers programme was N631.4 billion granted to 3,107,949 small holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million of land hectares; for the AGSMEIS, N111.7 billion to 29,026 beneficiaries; and for the Targeted Credit Facility, N253.4 billion to 548,345 beneficiaries \u2013 comprising 470,969 households and 77,376 SMEs.\n\nThe committee, according to him, noted that notwithstanding that all these have helped in boosting output, the CBN should continue to aggressively increase its interventions in these subsectors, including agricultural processing and manufacturing.\n\nHe said under the National Youth Investment Fund, N2.04 billion was disbursed to 7,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,411 were individuals and 2,646 were SMEs.\n\nAlso, under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative, the CBN has disbursed N3.19 billion to 341 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, music and software development.\n\nAlso commenting on the recent controversy regarding state governments repaying their loan obligations to banks as well as those under the CBN intervention facilities, Emefiele said the state governors must honour their loan agreements to parties involved.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are two aspects to these. There are intervention facilities granted by the CBN and there are bilateral facilities granted by the deposit money banks to them.\n\n\u201cThey went to deposit money banks, they asked for loans, they signed the offer letters with those banks.\n\n\u201cThey gave their ISPOs to the federal ministry of finance that on a monthly basis, the minister of finance should deduct from their money and pay the banks for the loans they have taken.\n\n\u201cAnd I am aware that the banks have written to finance and they have copied me that they want their money.\n\n\u201cIf it was a bilateral loan agreement, in fact, there is privacy of contract, yes, I am not part of it, they should pay their loans.\n\n\u201cOn the CBN intervention facility to the state governments, we are engaging the National Economic Council (NEC) and CBN is also insisting on its loan to be paid.\n\n\u201cBut depending on the outcome of the engagement between CBN, finance and NEC, we will begin to take the monies but in any case it\u2019s good for you to be a good debtor \u2013 when you take a loan you pay so that when you go back to the bank, you can get. But if refuse to pay, you will never smell the doorstep of the banker again.\u201d\n\nHe said while the CBN had extended repayment on its loan interventions till next year as part of the forbearances to cushion the impact of the pandemic, banks deserved the right to demand repayment of their loan disbursements following the rebound in economic activities.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn any case, the banks I must admit are seeking that there are some improvements in the economy, fragile as it may be- there are some improvements \u2013 crude prices have gone up and business activities are beginning to regain energy and life again.\n\n\u201cAnd if the banks ask for the repayment of their facilities, it will be justified.\n\n\u201cYou raised the issue of interest rates, that the banks are charging high interest rates. If we admit at CBN that we are controlling money supply and the banks raise interest rates in what I can call non-employment generating sectors or non-output generating sectors of the economy, we can\u2019t fault them.\n\n\u201cBecause we have our own intervention facility that are meant to target agriculture, SMEs and targeted households, which are meant to stimulate employment and also stimulate output for the country.\u201d\n\nOn whether the CBN had been vindicated following the crash of cryptocurrency market after the apex bank had opposed its operations in the country, Emefiele said it was not about CBN being vindicated.\n\nHe added that the CBN investigated and found out that a substantial percentage of Nigerians are involved in cryptocurrency which is \u201cnot the best.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, some may be legitimate but I dare say most are illegitimate and I will corroborate that. Under cryptocurrency and bitcoin, Nigeria comes second right? But in the global size of the economy, Nigeria comes 27th.\n\n\u201cSo do you think that there is some correlation? You think those countries whose economies are second and 26th will allow you to grow your cryptocurrency business to second position, if what is inside is a big deal that is going to profit everybody?\u201d\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cOf course, we saw it that the market collapsed\u2026Elon Musk twitted sometime about the time the CBN said our banking and payment infrastructure will no longer be available for cryptocurrency transactions \u2013 he twitted, that he was going to invest about $1.5 billion in crypto and the rates went to the highest roof.\n\n\u201cAnd he then twitted again and raised a fee concerns and the thing plunged. Elon Musk had himself decided that he will no longer deal in cryptos.\n\n\u201cAnd so if a man who felt it was good suddenly decides to say it\u2019s no longer good and then you\u2026don\u2019t forget, those who invented crypto said it is encrypted.\n\n\u201cWhen they say it\u2019s encrypted, it means that whatever is happening between me and you is only know to the two of us. And you know what? In case I defraud you because it is encrypted,y ou can\u2019t even disclose my name and you can\u2019t even get your money back.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CBN, while commending government\u2019s efforts in combating the headwinds imposed by the pandemic, advised against another nationwide lockdown as was experienced in 2020, adding that this will reverse the gains jointly achieved between the government and the apex bank in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nHe said the MPC assessed the options on direction of policy in the short to medium term and re-appraised current measures by the government to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and the general preparedness of relevant public health agencies to guard against the spread of the mutating strains of the virus.\n\nAccording to him, the committee noted the appropriate steps taken by the government to ensure that up to 70 per cent of the population get vaccinated to drastically drive down the infection rate in the country and hence, sustain economic activities.\n\nHe said:\u201dThe committee noted the persisting security crisis, especially in major food producing regions of the country and the severe toll on food supply and prices. It noted that inflation had moderated marginally due to the unrelenting effort of the bank in supporting agriculture to boost food supply and prices.\n\n\u201cThe committee, thus, reiterated its call to the government to intensify effort towards addressing the security situation in the country to ease supply bottlenecks and bring down food prices.\n\n\u201cThe MPC further noted government\u2019s commitment towards investing in public infrastructure despite constrained fiscal position and urged a continued focus on this objective, while exploring the option of effective partnership with the private sector, as improved road networks, telecommunications and power supply will greatly and proactively impact the supply chain and moderate price increments.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also stressed the need for collaboration with Nigeria\u2019s huge population living abroad, through the issuance of diaspora bonds targeted at specific infrastructure projects.\n\nThis is even as the committee noted that the public debt stock was currently high, it was of the view that project specific diaspora bond issues could conveniently pay itself back without imposing a burden on government finances.\n\nThe committee also noted the complementary role this would play in boosting foreign exchange supply, accretion to reserves and easing of the current exchange rate pressure.\n\nIn arriving at a decision to hold the rates, Emefiele said whereas the committee remained committed to supporting the efforts of the federal government in restorating the productive capacity of the economy, members remained much more focused towards achieving price stability in the short to medium-term.\n\nHe stated that economic growth could be hampered in an environment of unstable prices adding therefore, that the choice between loosening the stance of policy to ease credit further or tightening to moderate price development or maintaining a hold stance in order to allow previous policy measures continue to permeate the economy while observing global and domestic developments.\n\nHe said an expansionary stance of policy could transmit to reduced pricing of the loan portfolios of Deposit Money Banks and result, therefore, in cheaper credit to the real sector of the economy.\n\nHe added, however, that this expected transmission may be constrained by persisting security challenges and infrastructural deficits.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, while a contractionary stance will only address the monetary component of price development, supply side constraints such as the security crisis and infrastructural deficits can only be addressed by policies outside the purview of the central bank.\n\n\u201cA tight stance in the view of members, will also hamper the bank\u2019s objectives of providing low cost credit to households, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Agriculture, and other output growth and employment stimulating sectors of the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A clear and stable Facebook Live or Twitch stream requires an upload speed of up to 5 Mbps. On Zoom, group video calls in full HD require between 3 and 3.8Mbps.\n\nAs these services acquire more global audiences, the internet needs to be faster everywhere to provide uniform experiences to users. So how does speed vary within Africa, and when compared with countries outside the continent?\n\nSouth Africa leads mobile, Ghana fixed broadband\n\nUsers can test internet speed using a number of options. Netflix launched fast.com five years ago and it\u2019s a pretty handy tool. But to compare speeds across geographies, we will rely on data from Speedtest Global Index, a service owned by Ookla, a US-based internet analytics company.\n\nSpeedtest provides data for mobile and fixed broadband internet for more than 130 countries around the world. Mobile broadband is the connection available through SIM card-based network operators while fixed broadband typically requires a cable connection.\n\nAccording to their latest data for the first quarter of 2021, the global average for download speed is 53.38 Mbps for mobile and 102.12 Mbps for fixed broadband.\n\nAfrica\u2019s best performers scored below these marks. The best average speed for mobile internet in Africa was in South Africa (44.80 Mbps) while the mark for fixed broadband was in Ghana (51.93 Mbps).\n\nIn descending order, South Africa, Mali, Morocco, Cameroon, Tunisia, Egypt, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya (20.98 Mbps) were the top ten countries for mobile internet speeds in Africa in Q1 2021. The worst-ranked African country was Sudan (131st out of 134 overall) at 12.21 Mbps.\n\nThe top ten standings for fixed broadband are different: Ghana, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, South Africa, Madagascar, Egypt, Senegal, Seychelles, Morocco, Congo and Burkina Faso (23.81 Mbps). Guinea is the worst-ranked African country in this category (173rd out of 176 overall) with 6.66 Mbps.\n\nGhana leads on fixed mobile broadband\n\nSouth Africa, Egypt and Senegal appear in both top 10 lists. But which cities stand out across the continent? For this, we\u2019ll focus on mobile internet speeds and latency \u2013 a measure of how responsive an internet connection is.\n\nFrom Johannesburg to Kairouan\n\nSpeedtest shows the top cities for mobile internet speeds in South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Nigeria and Kenya, but not for other countries in the top ten \u2013 like Mali and Cameroon. As such, we are limited in how certain we are of the cities with the top internet speeds in Africa.\n\nHowever, we are able to guess that the major cities in South Africa, Morocco and Tunisia have the fastest speeds on the continent. Johannesburg leads the way with 55.64 Mbps while Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, comes in at 31.32 Mbps.\n\nIn Nigeria, Speedtest data shows Port-Harcourt \u2013 an oil-rich city in the Niger Delta region \u2013 has the fastest speed at 23.02 Mbps. Lagos, one of Africa\u2019s capitals of tech startups records an average of 19.72 Mbps \u2013 a lower mark than Nairobi (24.60) and Cape Town (36.68).\n\nWhere latency is concerned, Nigeria\u2019s main cities (Port-Harcourt, Lagos, Benin city, Kano, Ibadan) also lag behind main cities in comparable African countries.\n\nThe highest latency among South Africa\u2019s top five cities (Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban and Soweto) is 29 milliseconds. The highest among Kenya\u2019s top five is 39 milliseconds (in Eldoret). Latency is 40 milliseconds in Lagos but that\u2019s the least among Nigeria\u2019s top five. In Kano, the average is 75 milliseconds \u2013 more than twice the global average of 37 milliseconds.\n\nWhat are the numbers revealing to us?\n\nThe numbers above reflect internet performance between January and March 2021. As such, longer-term data will be needed to make better judgement.\n\nHowever, the numbers show a wide gap between internet speeds in Africa and the rest of the world. Africa has the fastest-growing mobile telecoms market but internet penetration is still at about 42%.\n\nLatency is not such a big deal if you are merely browsing social media, attending a Zoom meeting or streaming on Instagram. Anything below 100 ms is fine. But for gaming, between 20ms and 40ms is optimal.\n\nIncreasing download speeds and reducing latency will require more investment in infrastructure from telcos who provide mobile internet but also from fibre optic providers. On the mobile side of things, it means expanding 4G coverage and more 5G investment.\n\nOokla\u2019s 5G map shows South Africa has raced ahead of everyone else in terms of commercially available 5G, with 16 deployments mostly by MTN. Kenya has three deployments but they are limited. Nigeria, on the other hand, hopes to catch up soon by tapping into its satellite infrastructure.",

          "text": "Ethiopia has awarded one out of the two private telco licences it intends to award to a consortium that includes the Vodafone group. The consortium, which made a winning bid of $850 million, comprises Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc and Sumitomo Corp.\n\nThe licence award is a big step for Ethiopia as it marks the opening of its telecom sector to foreign investors. For years, the state-owned Ethiotel has held a monopoly but will now have competition.\n\nBeyond competition, it will have a significant economic impact, considering that the consortium will create 1.1 million jobs and invest $8.5 billion in the next ten years. According to a tweet by the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, \u201cit will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date.\u201d\n\nThe country also announced that it would not grant a second telecoms licence after rejecting a second bid from MTN.\n\nMTN\u2019s bid is not good enough\n\nThe prospect of a market with 112 million people is as good as it gets for many telcos, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that all the big names initially planned to make bids. Etisalat, Orange Telecoms, MTN and Saudi Telecom Company were some of the companies that registered interest.\n\nIn the end, only two companies put bids forward; the Vodafone consortium and MTN. Safaricom, one of the consortium companies, had announced prematurely in March that it had won the bid.\n\nRegardless, MTN also made a bid of $600 million which was considered not good enough, and now the second telecoms licence will now be retendered for new offers.\n\nOne interesting point is that MTN\u2019s bid was financed in part by a Chinese investor, while a newly created US foreign-aid agency backed the Vodafone consortium\u2019s bid. It is a continuation of what some observers call a competition on the tech front in Africa.\n\nA similar situation played out in Kenya as Safaricom rolled out its 5G service initially with Huawei providing support. The US reportedly had concerns with the decision to use Huawei, in line with a strategy of using its diplomatic might to dissuade African governments from buying into the technology solutions from the Chinese company.\n\nIn the end, Safaricom stuck with Huawei but also included the Finnish company, Nokia. Despite this, it is clear that this is not the last we\u2019ll see of the continuing competition between the US and China in Africa\u2019s tech space.",

          "title": "Successful product managers are walking encyclopedias",
          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of the people building brilliant products and services in Africa.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Tobi Lufadeju to Centre Stage because I admire how determined she is to succeed in her role and how invested she is in her personal and professional development. Even when she has moments where she feels like a small fish in a big sea, she doesn\u2019t allow her youthful insecurities to slow her down or get in the way of her responsibilities.\n\nTwo weeks after my meeting with Feranmi, I\u2019m back at Eric Keyser to meet with a very nervous but confident Tobi Lufadeju who is a young product manager at Reliance HMO.\n\nWhat were you doing in your early 20s? When I was Tobi\u2019s age, I was wrapping up my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in English literature and overthinking my future and career path.\n\nAt Reliance, Tobi is in charge of the consumer business unit.\n\n\u201cThe consumer business unit is basically the retail side of the business. But I don\u2019t just handle retail products \u2013 I also handle products for SMEs and our partners.\u201d\n\nCuriousity is a product manager\u2019s super power\n\nTobi describes herself as a curious person, so I had to ask how curiosity plays a role in her work:\n\n\u201cProduct management is the intersection of business, technology and design. Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work. In my role, I have an overview of what everyone is working on \u2013 from the frontend engineers to the DevOps team.\u201d\n\nWhen Tobi uses the word \u2018directing\u2019, I immediately picture a sharp-minded captain steering a large ship in open waters. The captain is responsible for not only the ship but her diverse team of crew members and cabin hands. Should aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams? This is what Tobi had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, they absolutely should have that expectation. As the product manager, you are the product\u2019s encyclopedia; so if the head of marketing needs information about the product, you have to know enough to give an appropriate answer. Being a curious person helps me learn as much as I possibly can about what we are building.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture product managers, what do you see them doing? Crunching numbers? Creating colourless spreadsheets? Tracking the lifespan of a product? Counting app downloads? What does their day-to-day work life look like for Tobi?\n\n\u201cI prioritize the work we are doing at all times and carve out time to do the work. I collaborate with different people and communicate our products\u2019 progress reports so everyone on the team knows what they need to do. I also make out time to speak to my direct supervisor \u2013 the business lead \u2013 and realign myself with our goals and plans for the quarter.\u201d\n\nWinning the battle over Impostor Syndrome\n\nProduct managers not only have to speak their product\u2019s language, but they also have to speak their team\u2019s language. How then do successful product managers navigate team management?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common myth that product managers are micromanagers; this isn\u2019t the case with me,\u201d Tobi said in-between bites of her chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cAlthough I operate as a kind of middle man, I don\u2019t meddle with the work. I trust my team to do what they are skilled at and leave them to run on their own. I also remember to connect with them as human beings. Yeah, I have to meet my deliverables but I have to support my team as well.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 64 million young people aged between 15 \u2013 35 years old living in Nigeria. It\u2019s obvious that our youth population is increasing rapidly with no plans of slowing down. But how prepared are they to enter local and global workplaces? How do young managers deal with issues such as impostor syndrome?\n\n\u201cThe first two months on the job were not easy. I joined an existing team which meant that I had to do a lot of learning and observation in the beginning. My team members would throw around in-house language during meetings and I also had to figure out how to speak the engineering team\u2019s language. I dealt with impostor syndrome big time.\u201d\n\nWhen you get hired by a new company, you have to make your first 100 days count. But being the newbie hire can be a daunting experience. How can new employees quieten the insecure voices in their heads and trust their abilities and skills?\n\n\u201cEven though the learning curve was steep in the beginning, I had to figure it out. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail because that\u2019s my name on the line. So whenever I felt confused after a meeting, I would call one of my team members back and ask questions. I still have moments where I\u2019m confused about certain things but I\u2019ve been given the leeway to experiment and try different tactics.\u201d\n\nCentre Stage tip: When in doubt or confused, ask questions.\n\nTips and tricks for aspiring and existing product managers\n\nEarlier in our conversation, Tobi mentions how important it is to be curious on the job. I asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with effective communication. You can\u2019t just tell people what to do, you have to help them understand what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and who needs to do it. If you cannot communicate clearly, you will not get the results you desire.\n\nPrioritisation is the second skill. Successful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times. When you have the bigger picture in your mind, it\u2019s easier to assign priority levels to different tasks.\n\nFinally, you need interpersonal skills. Although my team members don\u2019t directly report to me, I still have to learn how to speak to them with respect and empathy. When we have long weeks, I ensure I check in on the engineers because, at the end of the day, we are humans and need breaks from time to time.\n\nProduct managers need to learn how to give praise and encouragement, especially when they notice their team members are stressed or when their energy tanks are empty.\u201d\n\nTobi\u2019s role at Reliance HMO is her first stab at being a product manager. In addition to learning on the job, she\u2019s also had to invest her personal time in picking up new knowledge about her responsibilities and that of her team. So, what is she doing to improve her skills?\n\n\u201cPractice. I consciously track what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing my work. I make out time to reflect on my progress regularly. I follow product leaders and managers on LinkedIn\u2013 I read their articles and make note of the tips they share. I also use Blinkst to read books at an accelerated pace. At one point, I had access to Masterclass, I took some business and product-focused courses. My business lead also sends me resources like podcasts and articles.\u201d\n\nWhere your professional career is concerned, one thing you never stop doing is learning. Tobi is ambitious about being successful in her role and isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to achieve her definition of success. My key takeaway from my conversation with Tobi is that managers, no matter how young or experienced they are, must be courageous, curious, and competent.\n\n\u201cIf I had to share any tip with aspiring product managers, I would recommend researching what goes into being a product manager and taking one or two courses about what tools you need to use and what to do on the job. If you are on social media, follow conversational product leaders and engage with them on Twitter or LinkedIn. There\u2019s a lot to learn at once and the work hit me like a wrecking ball in the beginning.\n\nMeasure as objectively as you can. You cannot fit everything into an OKR or KPI framework. Sometimes, you have to use your intuition to measure yourself and how well you are succeeding as a manager and team member. How are you handling your team? Are you driven by impact or are you working for the sake of it? If you are focused on making an impact, you will always deliver value to the business.\u201d",

They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

          "title": "The gomoney App is The Digital Bank We all Deserve",
          "text": "The Nigerian digital financial service ecosystem continues to thrive as new challenger banks look to disrupt the many limitations of traditional banks. Many of these new digital banks differentiate themselves by being app-based and simplifying processes that have become bottlenecks with old brick and mortar banks.\n\nHowever, as the ecosystem continues to thrive with new apps, it is also becoming evident that service offerings amongst these new players have become repetitive with quite a number of these apps offering virtually the same thing \u2013 from promising quick account opening, zero charges on transactions to virtual cards that are so limited they can only be used on local platforms.\n\nRegardless of the clutter, one app that stands out with its positioning as the \u201cdigital bank users deserve\u201d is gomoney. Launched in 2020, gomoney prides itself as a full-fledged digital service provider simplifying its users\u2019 banking experience and also helping them make informed financial decisions through its robust features. While some of its features like virtual cards, sending & receiving payments, bills/utility payments are quite similar to that of other digital banks, gomoney ensures that these features are distinct and unique in their offerings enough to offer premium service to users and differentiate its app from competitors. The bank further adds an extra layer of convenience and intuitiveness to its app features which makes it user-centric and seamless to use. For example, gomoney users can receive payment by just sharing a payment link that is easily generated on the app. Or users can just tap on \u201cshare details\u201d to share their account information with others.\n\nHere is a first-hand review of some of gomoney\u2019s features that standout:\n\nVersatile Virtual Cards\n\nVirtual cards have become a staple offering with most digital banks. This feature is an alternative to physical debit cards in that it allows users do everything they can with their physical debit cards without the risk of the card getting lost, stolen or damaged. Today, virtual cards offered by most digital banks can only be used on local Nigerian platforms. Despite this limitation, most digital banks still charge between N500 \u2013 N1000 for virtual cards.\n\nDistinctively, the gomoney virtual card has to be the most versatile so far in terms of its acceptance on major international and local platforms. It is a Mastercard that is issued at no extra cost to the user and each user can even request up to 3 virtual cards. The gomoney virtual card can be used to pay for Apple iCloud storage, Apple Music and Spotify subscription, and even on international stock trading platforms like Trading212 and lifestyle sites like asos.. At N440 to $1, the conversion rate is significantly lower than its competitors\u2019 rates that fall somewhere around the N460 \u2013 N480 mark.\n\nBy simply opting to \u201cGet a virtual card\u201d and choosing a PIN, a user can generate a gomoney virtual card in seconds, and it automatically activates after 24 hours. Also, to ensure its security, gomoney virtual card details are by default encrypted and only become visible when users have entered their four-digit personal identification number.\n\nScheduled Payments Option\n\nWhat\u2019s better than being able to make an instant payment when you want? Being able to choose the exact date your payment goes out without having to wait for that day and on top of that be able to automate the frequency of such payment. The gomoney app allows users to do all of these and more. By tapping on the \u2018Payment\u2019 icon on the app, users can choose to either schedule their payment for later date and automate such to daily, weekly, monthly or yearly recurring payment as they wish. A slight concern might the fixed cost of N8.50 that each transaction incurs but when compared to traditional bank charges, this is negligible.\n\nAnother feature available on the app via the payment option is the \u201csplit payment\u201d or \u201cGroup bills\u201d feature (for ios or android respectively). As the name implies, this feature allows multiple users in a group to split payment amongst themselves easily be it for a hangout or quick contribution.The app automatically splits payment equally amongst users and also logs this into users\u2019 transaction reports tracker.\n\nFinancial Reports Like Never Before\n\nWhen gomoney describes itself as \u201cthe digital bank fostering a future where people have enough tools to make informed decisions about their money\u201d, it must have been referring in part to the robust Report feature on its app. This feature takes a whole different approach to financial reporting.

While its virtual card feature is one to beat for many digital apps, it would be nice if the app offers some flexibility in terms of physical cards for those that want them.\n\nYou can download the gomoney app here",
          "summary": "Many of these new digital banks differentiate themselves by being app-based and simplifying processes that have become bottlenecks with old brick and mortar banks.\nRegardless of the clutter, one app that stands out with its positioning as the \u201cdigital bank users deserve\u201d is gomoney.\nFor example, gomoney users can receive payment by just sharing a payment link that is easily generated on the app.\nDistinctively, the gomoney virtual card has to be the most versatile so far in terms of its acceptance on major international and local platforms.\nBy simply opting to \u201cGet a virtual card\u201d and choosing a PIN, a user can generate a gomoney virtual card in seconds, and it automatically activates after 24 hours.",

Yusuf Buba (APC-Adamawa) made the call in a statement on Wednesday after the committee interfaced with the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr Gabriel Aduda in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the entire petition which held itself as a \u201cNon- Paper\u201d, with no authors and signatures was a mere calculated attempt by a faceless group hiding under the banner of a pressure group to halt the ongoing reforms.\n\nBuba said that the reform is dealing with the many years of suspected systemic corruption and official malfeasance in the ministry.\n\nHe described the petition as an attempt to thwart every move to sanitise the operations of the ministry\u2019s headquarters and the foreign missions abroad in order to continue to maintain their vicious grip on the ministry.\n\nThe lawmaker said that no group should be allowed to make such weighty allegations in public without putting their names to the document.\n\nThe lawmaker said that the writers of the faceless petition had sought nothing positive to achieve other than to maliciously malign the characters of the leadership of the ministry and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cPart of the allegations contained in the so- called petition dealt extensively with the fiscal years of 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cMembers, therefore, wondered why Aduda, who assumed duties in January 2021 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after his redeployment from the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development, was particularly singled out for castigation and indictment.\n\n\u201cThe committee calls on the security agencies to fish out the authors of the petition, which members observed, sought to place the image of the ministry and by extension, that of the entire Nigerian nation, in bad light globally.\n\n\u201cWe laud the current efforts, amidst great challenges, that have been made to promote the mandate of the ministry and drive President Buhari\u2019s reforms agenda by Aduda.\n\n\u201cHe has indeed, pointed out the way he intends to go in actualising the dreams of the National Assembly for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the committee, unanimously commends the permanent secretary for his dogged commitment to upholding the reforms of President Buhari at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuba said that the committee condemned in very strong terms the mischief and malicious damage contained in the said \u201cNon \u2013 Paper\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, some of these suspected corrupt acts and alleged official malfeasance, as is well-known, have been the infamous subjects of recent investigations by the National Assembly.\n\nBuba said that information available to the committee by independent sources, showed a long retinue of accomplices and benefactors inside and outside the Ministry.\n\nHe, however, called for a forensic audit on the finances of the Ministry in those fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 with a view to ascertaining the true position of things in relation to the finances of the Ministry in those years.\n\nThe statement quoted Aduda to have described the petition as unfortunate saying that it came at a time efforts were being made to put things in their proper places in the ministry.\n\nAduda thanked committee for its commitment to ensuring that things were done right in the ministry, promising to do everything necessary to put the ministry in the right order.\n\nHe pledged to continue to reposition the ministry towards achieving its mandate and role of promoting the image of the nation through their representational mission of the country in the global community.\n\n...",

          "title": "Abubakar Shekau: Battle for supremacy among Islamist groups bodes ill for Sahel",
          "text": "The Nigerian military says it is investigating claims that the Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau is dead. His death has not been independently confirmed. It is also not the first time a claim like this has been made. The reports have nevertheless raised questions about who has the upper hand in the region \u2013 Boko Haram or the breakaway Islamic State West Africa Province. Adejuwon Soyinka, The Conversation\u2019s West Africa regional editor, asked Folahanmi Aina, an expert on Boko Haram and security in the Lake Chad Basin region, to analyse the security situation.\n\nWhat do you make of recent developments?\n\nAbubakar Shekau took over Boko Haram after the death of its founder Mohammed Yusuf in 2009. In that role he has been responsible for a brutal reign of terror in Nigeria\u2019s north east region as well as states of the Lake Chad region which make up part of the Sahel region.\n\nFrom various accounts he was also brutal in the way he retained control over his foot soldiers. Many became displeased with his style. This led to the creation in 2016 of the jihadi group\u2019s breakaway faction Islamic State of West African Province.\n\nTensions have remained high between the two groups. Both have sought to spread their political ideology across the region in a contest to win \u201chearts and minds\u201d.\n\nIslamic State West Africa Province appears to have been gaining ground in recent months. Some reports suggest it has taken control of Sambisa forest in the north east region of Nigeria.\n\nThe forest, once marked out as a game reserve by the colonial government, covers about 60,000km\u00b2 across the north east and extends to some parts of Kano state, the commercial hub of northern Nigeria.\n\nThe Shekau-led Boko Haram\u2019s area of dominance has predominantly been Nigeria\u2019s north east region while Islamic State West Africa Province has since consolidated its hold on the Lake Chad Basin region. Taking control of the forest would mark a major coup for the Islamic State West Africa Province. Sambisa Forest is strategically important because it\u2019s close to Maiduguri, the capital city of Borno, as well as Konduga and Barma.\n\nThe jihadist groups in West Africa, such as Jama\u2019at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, with about 2,000 fighters, are closely allied to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which is also known as Daesh. Another is the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. Affiliates of both ISIS and Al-Qaeda are known to be working closely together in West Africa. ISIS is widely believed to have emerged out of Al-Qaeda, following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Its ideology was largely shaped by Abu Musab Al-Zarqari, a Jordanian jihadist, whose goal was to foment a civil war between Sunnis and Shites as well as to create a caliphate.\n\nThe group\u2019s leadership \u2013 known as the ISIS Core \u2013 has since sought to expand beyond the Middle East following the killing of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in late 2019 by US commandos in Syria. It welcomed allegiance to it in 2016 by the Islamic State West Africa Province, which basically formalised its presence in West Africa and the Sahel.\n\nBoko Haram on the other hand has mostly sought to consolidate its hold on northern Nigeria by seeking to implement something similar, in the order of the Usman Dan Fodio-led Sokoto Caliphate, in the Kanuri homelands of the former Kanem-Borno Empire.\n\nThe relationship between the three is in their inherent goal to disrupt the idea of the modern nation state, which they view as a Western construct, while attempting to replace it with a caliphate.\n\nIslamic State West Africa Province appears to be consolidating its dominance in the region, providing it with tactical and operational advantage. This could imply a more consolidated ISIS presence and the spread of its influence in the Sambisa Forest area and the Lake Chad Basin region.\n\nIt also opens the door to the potential for new collaborations with other violent extremist organisations across the Sahel, who share the same ideological leanings.\n\nThe Nigerian military has been trying to flush out Boko Haram from Sambisa Forest for the past 12 years. It\u2019s a useful stronghold because the dense forest makes it possible to evade reconnaissance and aerial bombardments by the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nIslamic State West Africa Province\u2019s hold on the area could potentially prolong the war on insurgency. It could, for example, enable it to set up new training camps. This would help it in two ways: it could provide extensive training for its recruits within Nigeria, as against Libya where a significant number of fighters receive training. It could also potentially attract more foreign terrorist fighters into Nigeria.\n\nLastly, controlling the forest would mean that Islamic State West Africa Province would be poised to inflict further terror on Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states across north east Nigeria. It is also likely to attempt attacks on the southern part of the country, while reinvigorating its attacks on the states in the Lake Chad Basin region.\n\nHow worried should countries in the region be?\n\nThey have a lot more to be worried about now.\n\nAny advances by the Islamic State West Africa Province will earn it further endorsement from ISIS Core. In turn, this would offer better access to funding and more sophisticated weaponry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince ISIS Core was dismantled in the Middle East, its remnants have sought a new haven. The Islamic State West Africa Province\u2019s hold of Sambisa Forest would be a major boost.\n\nThe implications are that countries in the region face a long battle ahead.\n\nOne possible scenario is a more aggressive and sustained reign of terror across the region by Islamic State West Africa Province.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how Boko Haram will react if indeed Islamic State West Africa Province has taken over the forest. One possible course of action is that it seeks new alliances that would give it access to the growing network of armed bandits.\n\nThe broader consequence for the region is that countries might have to intensify military campaigns. An emphasis on militarising their efforts to counter insurgency efforts would come at the expense of a multi-layered approach that makes room for addressing root causes.\n\nWhat should Nigeria and other countries be doing?\n\nGovernments need to continue doing all they can to shape public opinion to dissuade potential recruits from joining the ranks of the insurgency groups.\n\nIn the case of Nigeria, it needs to come up with a tailored strategy that prioritises human intelligence by using local assets in the north east region to infiltrate and sabotage the Islamic State West Africa Province from within.\n\nA target group for this would be disgruntled elements within the senior ranks of Boko Haram.\n\nLastly, the threat to stability, peace and security across the region will persist unless governments address poverty, inequality, unemployment, state fragility and climate-induced tension.",

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nAbidemi Rufai, the Nigerian accused of defrauding Washington\u2019s Employment Security Department in last year\u2019s unemployment fraud attack faces additional charge in the U.S.\n\nMyNorthwest.com reported on Tuesday that Rufai is also accused of submitting fraudulent claims for FEMA disaster relief, the IRS, and the Small Business Administration, going back to 2017.\n\nThe Nigerian politician from Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State is considered by investigators to be the first major player arrested in Washington\u2019s unemployment fraud attack, in which criminals are estimated to have stolen at least $650 million.\n\nNow Federal attorneys in the Western District of Washington are battling to block a bail granted to him last week by a Federal magistrate in New York.\n\nThe news platform said an appeal has been filed before a western district judge in Washington state.\n\nThe Western District judge has until June 4 to make a decision on that appeal, reports MyNorthwest.com\n\nLast week, a different judge in the Eastern District of New York had decided to release Abidemi Rufai on $300,000 bail, pending the decision on the appeal.\n\nRufai was to be released to the home of a family friend Nekpen Soyemi, a nurse with an address on Long Island. Until the appeal is decided, Rufai remains behind bars.\n\nHowever, federal attorneys stated in their appeal that Rufai\u2019s bail placement was a risky one, as the husband of Rufai\u2019s would-be guardian was convicted in 2014 of buying the stolen personal information of dozens of people and using it to commit fraud.\n\n\u201cWe do not think it\u2019s appropriate that someone who\u2019s been accused of wire fraud would be released into a home where \u2014 of the couple, the two people living there \u2014 the male part of the couple has already been convicted federally of wire fraud,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nShe explained that it is standard practice to keep someone released on bail away from former felons.\n\n\u201cGenerally, when someone is going to be released on bond, one of the conditions you often see is that they are not to associate with people who have criminal histories,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nThe appeal also noted that Rufai\u2019s named custodian was identified by her bank \u201cas a suspect in an email impersonation and money laundering scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Western District of Washington believes that he needs to come out here and face these charges in the district where they\u2019re filed,\u201d said Emily Langlie, communication director at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Washington.\n\nRufai\u2019s travel documents were seized, and his movements, if he is released on bond, will be monitored with an ankle bracelet. He would also be forbidden from leaving the Eastern District of New York \u2014 or eventually, the Western District of Washington.\n\nHowever, federal attorneys stated in their appeal that Rufai\u2019s bail placement was a risky one, as the husband of Rufai\u2019s would-be guardian had been convicted in 2014 of buying the stolen personal information of dozens of people and using it to commit fraud.\n\nBesides the concern of guardianship, the appeal stated that Rufai is an extreme flight risk for several reasons.\n\nFor one, Rufai was already attempting to go back to Nigeria, and presumably would have done so had he not been detained; he was arrested at New York City\u2019s JFK International Airport on May 14 while attempting to board a flight back to Nigeria, by way of Amsterdam.\n\nThe appeal noted that Rufai has no clear ties to the Western District of Washington, and has just one family member living in the United States.\n\nIn contrast, Rufai\u2019s wife and children live in Nigeria, and he holds an appointed government position as senior special assistant to the governor of a Nigerian state. While he has been suspended from that position following his arrest, he has not been fired.\n\nAdditionally, Rufai allegedly has a history of forging identification documents, and prosecutors worry he could easily obtain a false passport. They noted that at the time of his arrest he held a first-class plane ticket and several other items of luxury, suggesting that he has the financial means of getting away.\n\n\u201cRufai is experienced in obtaining and trafficking in stolen identities and identification documents. He has the skills and resources to produce fraudulent documents that would allow him to leave the country,\u201d the attorneys wrote, adding, \u201cLocation monitoring will not guarantee Rufai\u2019s appearance. A defendant determined to flee can simply remove his location monitoring device and disappear.\u201d\n\nProsecutors believe that Rufai would be gone for good if he did get back to Nigeria, noting that it is hard enough to extradite ordinary Nigerian citizens, much less high-power government members.\n\n\u201cExtradition would be difficult \u2014 in part because he is a government official there,\u201d Langlie told KIRO Radio last week.\n\nIf prosecutors get their way, Rufai will be transported to Seattle \u2014 though he could still be let out on bail once in Washington.\n\n\u201cRather than have him released in New York, it\u2019s our preference that the U.S. Marshals Service transport him to the Western District of Washington, and then he can have another bail release hearing here,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nShe did not have a timeline on when that could happen, noting that, for security reasons, they don\u2019t tend to find out ahead of time when a person is being transported by the Marshals.\n\nWhatever the judge decides on the appeal, that decision could further be appealed by either side before it is considered final.",

All leaders should invest in one another and thinking of each other\u2019s well-being, and do whatever it takes to create a stable and sustainable African continent.\n\n\u201cThe continued emergence and spread of this crisis require resources and a mindset to pursue peace, also put in place good politics. We cannot just switch off crisis unless we invest in addressing the root causes of these problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, African leaders have had discussions, but there is the need to \u201cput a sense of urgency because we have other crises like poverty that we need to address.\u201d\n\nMr Kagame said to African leaders to capitalise and profit from the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA), adding that the continent stands to gain more by coming together.\n\n\u201cWe must utilise the youth, women, and other institutions to help us overcome the crises faced across the continent, but we cannot drop the ball right in the middle of it for smaller interests or benefits and forget about the common interest.\n\n\u201cFor example, we have put in place the AfCTA. We must capitalise on that and benefit from it so that we do not just have it in name but in the area of practice. We cannot benefit until countries work together in peace, with security in place and stability,\u201d explained the Rwandan president.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has lamented alleged killing and attacks on northerners living in the south and other parts of the country.\n\nIt also said the forum will no longer fold its hands and allow the \u201cunprovoked killings\u201d to continue, especially with the issue of open grazing and ranching being considered by different governments.\n\nThe group made the position known in a statement made available to Blueprint in Abuja Tuesday and signed by NEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.\n\nThe forum said many state governors were to blame for allowing attacks on helpless herders in their states, even as it said it was open to dialogue in ending insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum (NEF) is convinced that it is time to respond to issues that threaten our collective security and the unity and integrity of the country. The Forum has held back on joining issues with persons and groups intent on provoking the type of crises that will escalate beyond control or mitigation by leaders, who are collectively showing definite signs that they are unwilling to steer the country away from the dangerous threats which are crippling it.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that elected people sworn to protect the constitution and protect the unity and integrity of Nigeria have decided to surrender to deeply divisive or out rightly irredentist and secessionist tendencies and movements. In the South East, governors are yielding their political turf and mandates to secessionists, criminals and subversives, who think they can exterminate federal presence and northerners from the region and achieve dubious political goals related to 2023 or break away from the country.\n\n\u201cIn the South-west, elected leaders and pampered ethnic bullies are closing ranks to provide a front that apes the do-what-we-want-or-we-leave-the-country strategy of the marginalised leaders of the South East. Governors are building ethnic monsters and hiding behind them to whip up sentiments in a crude attempt to extract concessions no one is in a position to give or guarantee.\n\n\u201cThe South-south is squeezed between fear and uncertainty and its leaders are gambling that they can benefit from further weakening the federal administration and the North if it rides along with the rest of the South.\n\n\u201cA plastic unity is being contrived to create the impression that the entire South is united behind shared grievances against the Presidency and Fulani herders and all northerners, who are cast as fair game in responding to all of President Buhari\u2019s multiple failures. A desperate, but futile attempt is being made to split the North along lines that suit people who ignore its complexities and plurality when it is convenient to lump all Northerners and submit them to humiliation or attacks.\n\n\u201cThe NEF recognises that most of these provocations feed from the widespread perception of a weak national leadership and a broken political process that has become captive of narrow political interests. For the record, the forum restates its support for a programmed transition that will eliminate open grazing and the establishment of productive, safe and sustainable options in managing our huge national asset in animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be achieved with threats and harassment, but with commitment and collaboration involving all governments and stakeholders. It is in everyone\u2019s interests to support an urgent national initiative that will engineer a safe and productive transition to the end of open grazing. In the meantime, the forum must warn those attacking and killing Fulani herders to stop. There are limits to every community\u2019s tolerance, and the forum strongly advises that lines are respected in the manner we treat Nigerians, who are vulnerable wherever they live.\u201d\n\nThe elders added: \u201cThe forum has always supported initiatives that improve the quality of inputs into how Nigerians can address the limitations in the manner the country is operated. It is unfortunate that the current efforts of the National Assembly to amend the constitution enjoys little or no confidence among Nigerians that they will address the fundamental challenges which need to be comprehensively addressed, although this can be redressed if our elected representatives recognize the historic opportunities they have to move this country beyond its strangulating challenges.\n\n\u201cThe negative attitude of the Presidency towards engaging Nigerians to tap into ideas, grievances and goodwill of many citizens who mean well is ill-informed and, under our current circumstances, dangerous. So are postures that issue opportunistic ultimatums over convening national dialogue by the President. The forum supports a citizen-driven national dialogue and a campaign to get the government to accord its outcome the respect it deserves. The forum extends its hands to groups that genuinely believe that Nigerians should demand and design the type of country we want, and should not wait for people we elected to set the boundaries and conditions of our existence.\n\n\u201cThe forum restates that the North will not be cowed and stampeded into escorting political ambitions of politicians at the cost of its rights, security and dignity. It demands that President Buhari asserts the powers our constitution gives him to protect our territorial integrity and secure citizens, or accept that he is incapable of leading the nation through these unprecedented challenges.\n\n\u201cAttacks on lawful Fulani and other Northerners in the South must stop and those who have killed them must be brought to book. The nation needs to know that Northerners in many parts of the South now live in heightened fear as they are profiled and harassed by elements in host communities, who believe that there are no consequences for their actions.\n\n\u201cThe forum demands an end to attacks on federal agents and facilities. Governors in the South must be unambiguous in their condemnation and resistance against these dangerous activities. They cannot continue to walk on both sides of the street. Northern governors should note that they are rapidly receding into irrelevance as desperate citizens\u2019 chalk up their silence over multiple assaults in a country where they have equal rights to their security and dignity.\n\n\u201cIf our country is to survive its current difficulties and build a better nation, President Buhari must improve his levels of competence, awareness that the nation is sliding into disaster and sensitivity to the frustrations of Nigerians. Other political leaders, who take advantage of the limitations of the President to light fires, should know that they will get burnt in them.\n\n\u201cOverwhelming majority of Nigerians do not want war or an end to our union. We just want an end to insecurity, escalating cost of living and the hate and the fear which our leaders are triggering. The forum restates its readiness to engage any group of Nigerians in exploring productive paths to a better future. What it will not do is to watch as the North is damaged further by cynical southern politicians and adventurers who think the North is too weak to protect its own interests.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Tuesday accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the burning of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in various parts of the country.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan made the position known in a statement issued in Abuja.\n\nHe restated the party\u2019s position that the APC has \u201cbeen promoting acts of violence including burning of INEC offices in other to build up an emergency situation and frustrate the smooth conduct of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIt is despicable that having realised that it has no place in the 2023 election, given its abysmal failure in governance, APC leaders are seeking to set our country ablaze and truncate our hard-earned democracy.\u201d\n\nPDP urged Nigerians to \u201cnote the failure of the APC and its leaders to forcefully condemn this clear assault on our frontline institution of democracy. This is also as the APC administration has failed to take decisive steps to protect INEC facilities from assailants.\n\n\u201cOur party wants the APC to know that May 29, 2023 date is sacrosanct for it to leave office, free our nation from its stranglehold and fizzle out from our political firmament.\n\n\u201cIndeed, history will not be kind to APC and its leaders given the magnitude of atrocities they have committed against Nigerians in a space of six years.\n\n\u201cThe APC has destroyed our nation, opened our dear fatherland to bandits and terrorists, turned our nation into an expansive killing field and a large funeral palour.\n\n\u201cAPC has wrecked our economy, opened our national vaults to its leaders to pillage over N15 trillion and reduced our once thriving country to a beggar nation while mortgaging our future with humongous foreign debts.\n\n\u201cOur party calls on the Inspector General of Police to immediately invite and question APC leaders over the burning of INEC offices.\n\n\u201cNigerians also expect the police to immediately place APC leaders and their thugs on watch list as a firm step to guarantee the security of INEC facilities and other institutions of democracy in the country.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also calls on Nigerians, across board, to remain at alert and unite in prayers so that our nation survives the next two years under the vindictive, insensitive, incompetent, treasury looting, divisive and violent APC and its administration,\u201d the PDP stated.\n\nAPC responds\n\nAnd in a swift response, the governing APC said the opposition PDP was behind the consistent attacks on the INEC facilities.\n\nIn a statement signed Tuesday evening in Abuja by the national secretary, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the party likened PDP\u2019s statement to the Biblical judgement of King Solomon in the case of the two women claiming to be the rightful mother of a child.\n\nThe party said: \u201cUsing lies and sponsored media attacks on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government, the PDP has inadvertently shown its hands as sponsors behind the politically-motivated attacks on some of our public and democratic institutions in the country, all in a clearly desperate bid to destabilise this government.\n\n\u201cUntil now, the APC had deliberately refrained from commenting on the obviously sponsored attacks on INEC facilities in order not to pre-empt the efforts of our security services to unravel the sponsors. The truth is now in the open and our security services should act fast and decisively against these enemies of democracy and haters of a legitimately elected government.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the PDP thinks Nigerians have forgotten its long and documented penchant of eroding and destroying democratic institutions. To name one, was it not the same PDP that attempted to discredit INEC and the entire 2019 election with a bogus tale of a server that never existed and employed hackers to disrupt the communication network of the electoral body during 2019 election?\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe further said the APC cannot be at home and burn its house.\n\n\u201cA winner cannot destroy the process that brought it to success. From the 2015 to 2019 elections, Nigerians spoke clearly through their votes for the APC by mandating us to rescue the country from the PDPs 16-year misadventure. The PDP should address itself to the reality that it stands rejected by the electorates. Its undemocratic plan is ill-fated and will fail woefully.\n\n\u201cIn other respected democratic climes, criminalities and governance are differentiated. There is no attempt to politicise, sponsor and weaponise insecurity as the PDP is relentlessly doing. We call on Nigerians to completely reject and resist the PDP antics and actions. They do not mean well for this country,\u201d the ruling party also added.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has ordered the military junta in Mali to immediately and unconditionally release the detained transitional President and Prime Minister.\n\nSpokesperson, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ferdinand Nwonye in a statement said the action is totally unacceptable.\n\nIt warned the key military actors and perpetrators of the condemnable act to beware of the fact that stakeholders in the region and friends of Mali reject any act of coercion of the detained officials, including forced resignations.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria condemns in strong terms the detention of the duo of interim President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane of Mali.\n\n\u201cThe two key officials in the transitional government of Mali were reportedly taken by Soldiers to the Kati Military Camp near the Capital, Bamako on Monday 24, May 2021.\n\n\u201cThe action is totally unacceptable and might derail the peace building efforts and time table for the return of democratic governance in Mali\u201d.\n\nDiplomatic and government sources said that the reason for the detention is not unconnected to governmet reshuffle that affected some of the military guys in the transitional government.\n\nInternational media reported that President Bah Ndaw, Prime Minister Moctar Ouane and defence minister Souleymane Doucoure were all taken to a military base in Kati outside the capital Bamako, hours after two members of the military lost their positions in a government reshuffle.\n\nThe sacking of the pillars of the coup was an enormous misjudgement,\u201d a senior former Malian government official told the international medium.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 mission in Mali called for the group\u2019s \u201cimmediate and unconditional\u201d release and said those who hold the leaders would have to answer for their actions.\n\nA delegation from the top regional decision-making body ECOWAS will visit Bamako on Tuesday to help resolve the \u201cattempted coup\u201d, ECOWAS, the U.N., African Union, European Union and several European countries said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cThe international community rejects in advance any act imposed by coercion, including forced resignations,\u201d the group further said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department called in a statement for the \u201cunconditional release of those currently being held\u201d.\n\nRecall that on August 18, 2020 young military officers overthrew the country\u2019s elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, after a mounting wave of protests against his handling of Mali\u2019s conflict and the country\u2019s economic malaise.\n\nUnder the threat of international sanctions, the officers, headed by the American trained officer and leader of the coup, Colonel Assimi Goita handed power between September and October to a caretaker government, which is meant to rule for 18 months before staging elections.\n\nThe military government was officially disbanded in January, although the army has retained a tight grip on the interim government. The pledge of an 18-month transition had spurred many doubts as to whether the military-dominated government had the will, or the ability, to stage elections on such a timescale.\n\nEarlier in the year, Lieutenant Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, the minister of territorial administration, told reporters that the first round of voting will take place on February 27, 2022 and a second round will follow in March.\n\nThe dates strictly uphold promises of an 18-month transition for returning to an elected government, Maiga said.\n\nMeanwhile the continental and sub-regional bodies have been lethargic about the issue, as all the resolutions of ECOWAS on the issue were not backed by actions ostensibly because of divergent interest of member states.\n\nOnly recently the\n\nECOWAS Parliament said that its non recognition of the parliamentarians from Mali has been referred to ECOWAS Court of Justice for interpretation.\n\nThe parliament maintained that it would not recognize parliamentarians from Mali following the military junta that took over the political leadership of the country.\n\nThe parliament further maintained that it would not recognize undemocratic governance under any guise.\n\nThe Community parliament later side tracked and allowed the MP from Mali\u2019s disbanded parliament to participate in its first extra ordinary session in Sierra Leone as observers.\n\nSuch weak disposition could not send any meaningful strong message to the transitional Government.",

          "text": "Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Tuesday said the Federal Government\u2019s insistence on open grazing suggests it has a hidden agenda.\n\nThe Presidency had on Monday faulted the recent resolutions of the Southern Governors, including the ban on open grazing in the entire southern part of the country.\n\nA statement signed by Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said the Governors\u2019 resolutions failed to provide any solution to the lingering crisis between farmers and herders in the country.\n\nInstead, the statement added, President Buhari has \u201ccommissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the States, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\u201d\n\nBut the Benue State Governor, in a statement signed by spokesman Terver Akase, said the insistence on open grazing reserves was curious.\n\n\u201cWe find the move not only shocking and curious but also as a misplaced priority,\u201d the Ortom statement said.\n\n\u201cAt a time the country is worried about the worsening security situation and many Nigerians are calling for national dialogue to address the fundamental issues that have led to the present state of affairs, the Federal Government considers the reopening of cattle grazing routes as the only solution available to it.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Open Grazing Ban: Southern Governors Did Not Provide Any Solution \u2013 Presidency\n\nThe Governor faulted the Federal Government\u2019s plan to commence rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country next month.\n\nOrtom recalled that the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) had met on February 9 and agreed that the current system of herding mainly by open grazing is no longer sustainable, in view of the growing urbanisation and population of the country.\n\nWhile noting that the Forum consequently resolved to sensitize herders on the need to adopt ranching as the new method of animal husbandry, Ortom said the 17 Governors of Southern Nigeria also met on May 11 in Asaba and banned open grazing in the entire region.\n\nThe Southern Governors, the Benue leader added, adopted ranching as the alternative method of rearing animals.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs it stands, the Presidency is the lone hand pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of 1950s and 60s. The Presidency has, by its endorsement of open grazing, emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all lands in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original owners of such lands.\n\n\u201cThe fact must be established that grazing reserves or cattle routes are no longer tenable in the 21st century when Nigeria\u2019s population far exceeds that of the fifties at a time these routes were contemplated.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities. The country\u2019s land mass has also reduced to less than 923 square kilometers with the excision of Bakassi to Cameroon. Besides, the international best practice of animal husbandry is ranching; and that\u2019s the stand of Benue State.\u201d",

In 2014, al-Assad won nearly 89 percent of the vote.\n\nAl-Assad is seeking a fourth seven-year term against two government-approved opposition candidates: Abdullah Salloum Abdullah, former state minister of parliamentary affairs; and Mahmoud Ahmad Marei, head of the National Democratic Front, a small, state-endorsed opposition party. Forty-eight other presidential aspirants had submitted requests for candidacy, but their applications were rejected.\n\nAl-Assad allies Iran and Russia, as well as Belarus, sent delegations to monitor the election.\n\nMeanwhile, the foreign ministers of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement in which they described the polls as a sham. \u201cFor an election to be credible, all Syrians should be allowed to participate, including internally displaced Syrians, refugees, and members of the diaspora, in a safe and neutral environment,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), which controls northeastern Syria, slammed al-Assad\u2019s government for obstructing negotiations and meetings. \u201cWe will not be part of the presidential election process and we will not participate in it,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nLike Western states, the SDC called for the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed unanimously in late 2015 and calls for an end to hostilities and a political solution to the Syrian conflict.\n\nThe resolution is meant to pave the way for internationally monitored elections following amendments to the constitution.",

Rivlin accepted, according to a statement from his office.\n\nBlinken described Egypt and Jordan as central players in trying to bring calm to the region. Both countries are key US allies that have peace agreements with Israel and frequently serve as mediators between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\n\u201cEgypt played a critical role in helping to broker the cease-fire and Jordan has long been a voice for peace and stability in the region,\u201d he told reporters late Tuesday.\n\nIn Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, he was scheduled to meet with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and other top officials. Biden spoke with el-Sissi during the war to help broker the cease-fire.\n\nDuring talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Tuesday, Blinken made clear that the US has no immediate plans to pursue peace talks between the sides, perhaps because previous efforts by past administrations have all failed. Instead, he expressed hope for creating a \u201cbetter environment\u201d that might lead to peace talks.\n\nThat could begin with the Gaza reconstruction effort. The 11-day war killed more than 250 people, mostly Palestinians, and caused heavy destruction in the impoverished coastal territory. Preliminary estimates have put the damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIn a gesture to the Palestinians, Blinken on Tuesday announced plans to reopen the US consulate in Jerusalem \u2014 an office that historically handled diplomatic outreach to the Palestinians.\n\nBlinken also announced nearly $40 million in additional aid to the Palestinians. In all, the Biden administration has pledged some $360 million to the Palestinians, restoring badly needed aid that the Trump administration had cut off.",
