          "text": "No fewer than 50,000 Nigerians have downloaded the eNaira application, 24 hours after it was launched by the Federal Government.\n\nThis is as many users gave negative reviews of the application.\n\nOn Google Play Store, the application is rated two stars of the obtainable five stars.\n\nThough Apple App Store did not show the number of downloads, the App is rated four of five.\n\nThe 8.8 megabytes app is designed with green as its dominant colour, with a mixture of white and black.\n\nAccording to the offeror of the App, the Central Bank of Nigeria, the 1.0.0 version needs permission to take pictures and videos.\n\n\u201ceNaira Speed Wallet is a fast and convenient way to conduct financial transactions. Your money is guaranteed and secured with the Central Bank of Nigeria. eNaira Speed wallet is a fast and convenient way to conduct financial transactions,\u201d CBN said while telling users about the App.\n\nIt was observed that it enables payment of people using only their verified user name.\n\nHowever, many users complained of bugs.\n\nAccording to them, they encountered challenges trying to set up an account.\n\nWhile some said the App is not accepting their e-mail addresses, others complained that it was rejecting their Bank Verification Numbers.\n\nSome users also said activation email goes into junk and spam folders.\n\nOne of them, Omenkukwu Chinedu, said, \u201cVery poor user experience so far. It is a known fact that email was not a mandatory requirement setting up BVN, now this app wants to use the BVN email. This will stampede a lot of people trying to update their BVN.\u201d\n\nOghenevwogaga Olotu added, \u201cAbout 80 per cent of Nigerians don\u2019t have emails linked to their BVN and to use the app they expect Nigerians to start going to banks to fic it just to use an app? If CBN wants eNaira wallet to be used in our day-to-day living, then they should make it easy to use and accessible for everyone. Everything in Nigeria always has to be complicated.\u201d\n\nKadiri Akeem said, \u201cGreat App and seems promising. More than an hour after I agreed the activation link should be sent to my email, it has not been sent. I have requested a resend several times, yet no response.\u201d\n\nAlso, Anyaogu Peter said, \u201cI don\u2019t have access to the email linked to my BVN anymore. To use your App, I will have to go and change it. A better way would have been to use phone numbers. That would accommodate everyone.\u201d\n\nGieve Blackjoe expressed displeasure over the App, saying, \u201cWhen I read about this innovation by CBN, I was thrilled but I am not enthused anymore. I am rather being discouraged from using this maiden platform that should be seamless as anticipated. I will uninstall it.\u201d\n\nGeorge Victor complained that he was finding it difficult to transact on the App.\n\n\u201cI have successfully registered and the App is working well but there is no means of crediting the eNaira wallet. I checked banks\u2019 mobile App (Zenith, Access, Gtbank). There is no option of sending money to eNaira wallet. This is making the eNaira wallet look useless,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to the complaints, CBN said, \u201cWe apologise for the difficulties you experienced while registering with us. We understand this can be frustrating.\n\n\u201cWe would chat with you with regards to your experience with us. We are working hard to improve the App.\n\n\u201cWe are working towards making this better. We regret the inconvenience you had faced. [email protected]\u201d",

          "text": "The Senate Committee on Science and Technology has rejected the 2022 budget proposal of the National Board for Technology Incubation.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, Senator Uche Ekwunife, stated this on Tuesday when the management of the board, led by its acting Director General, Taiwo Somefun, appeared before her panel to defend its 2022 budget.\n\nEkwunife said the panel hinged its decision on the merger of the hitherto separate budgets of the over 40 incubation centres across the country with that of the agency\u2019s headquarters in the next year\u2019s fiscal estimates.\n\nShe, therefore, demanded the immediate restoration of the semi-financial autonomy granted to the centres over the years in the interest of the nation\u2019s economy and that of the gifted Nigerian youths.\n\nEkwunife also called on the Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed, to act on the letter of protest from the Ministry of Science and Technology on the matter and revert to the previous arrangements.\n\nShe vowed that her panel would not pass the NBTI\u2019s 2022 budget unless the anomaly was corrected.\n\nShe also alleged that the action of the Finance Minister could kill technological innovations among the Nigerian youths if the anomaly was not immediately corrected.\n\nThe Senator said, \u201cThe National Board for Technology Incubation is one of the key parastatals of the Federal Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, vested with the responsibility of conception and delivery of technological ideas in the country.\n\n\u201cAmong other key functions of the agency is to identify viable research and technological resource, indigenous technology and knowledge for commercialisation and develop strategies and processes for incubating them.\n\n\u201cIt also coordinates technology incubation in the country.\n\n\u201cIn the light of this, and many functions of the NBTI, there is no better time than now that we need optimal capacity performances of the board.\n\n\u201cThere is high turnover of graduates on yearly basis from our institutions of higher learning.\n\n\u201cSince there are scarce white-collar jobs, the need for a paradigm shift to equip youths with technological skills that would make them self reliant can not be overemphasised.\n\n\u201cAlso, if the NBTI had performed its duty creditably, antisocial behaviours such as juvenile delinquency, drug abuse and other vices among the youths would drastically reduce, if not totally eradicated in our society.\n\n\u201cThe committee noted the over 40 business technology incubation outlets providing natural platforms for entrepreneurial skills across the country.\n\n\u201d I am happy that the performances of the NBTI centres in the South-South and South-East geopolitical zone are quite encouraging despite inadequate publicity of their programmes to let the citizens use the golden opportunities provided for them.\n\n\u201cWhile the committee is canvassing adequate funding for the NBTI to sustain their performance, the 2022 budget proposal cancelled the semi financial autonomy granted to this important agency and its centres in the past.\n\n\u201cThe budgets of the incubation centres had been merged with that of the NBTI headquarters which is totally unacceptable by this committee.\n\n\u201cThe committee perceives this as a reversal of the successes recorded by the centres and calls for the immediate restoration of the semi financial autonomy granted to them in the previous budgets.\n\n\u201cThe NBTI centres are quite resourceful, enterprising and focused. This is one of the best agencies, if not the best, being supervised by the Ministry of Science and Technology.\n\n\u201cTo see those important centres that are doing well being merged with the headquarters, I don\u2019t know what they expect them to do now.\n\n\u201cWhat the centres need now is funding not merging them with the headquarters.\n\n\u201cThe type of jobs they are doing will conformably equip our young graduates because they are coming up with beautiful innovation in the ICT that can put Nigeria on the map of progress.\n\n\u201cSo, merging them with the headquarters is wrong. I don\u2019t know what informed the decision. It is a very unpopular decision, it is illegal and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why the budget office should merge such centres with the headquarters. That means they want to kill the economy of this country.\n\n\u201cThe committee will follow up to ensure that the Federal Government stop the merger of the centres\u2019 budgets with that of the headquarters.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sit down here and watch the Minister of Finance kill this economy by merging those centres with the headquarters.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Science and Technology has written the Finance Minister, and the Committee will also officially communicate to them our rejection of that very unpopular decision.\u201d",

          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu\n\n. Warns of consequences if torture allegations are confirmed\n\n. Wants further violations of rights halted\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nThe United Nations has issued \u2018Urgent Appeals\u201d to both the Nigerian and Kenyan Governments respectively, demanding immediate stoppage of any torture or violation of rights committed against the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nUN also warned of serious consequences if the allegations of torture and violation of fundamental human rights against the IPOB leader were confirmed.\n\nThe UN intervention followed a petition to the UN by Kanu\u2019s brother, Kanunta Kanu; and his Special counsel, Mr. Aloy Ejimakor.\n\nUN\u2019s \u201cUrgent Appeals\u201d to Nigeria and Kenya according to a statement by Kanunta have been transmitted to both countries since August 26, and acknowledgment received from the Nigeria\u2019s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York on September 17.\n\nThe statement made available to Vanguard Tuesday read in part: \u201cIn particular, the said Urgent Appeals state in part that the United Nations is \u201calarmed by the alleged torture and ill-treatment Mr. Kanu has been subjected to during his illegal custody in Kenya.\n\nIt further read:\u201d If confirmed, these allegations would constitute prima facie violations of fundamental human rights, including the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of liberty, and the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment under the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights (ICCPR).\n\n\u201cThe allegations in the case of Mr. Kanu raise serious violations of international human rights law and may cause irreparable damage to his life or personal integrity, which we believe warrants prompt attention. In this regard, we are considering to publicly express our concerns in this case in the near future, believing that the wider public should be informed about the implications of these allegations for the enjoyment and exercise of human rights in Kenya and Nigeria. Any public expression of concern in this regard, will indicate that we have been in contact with your Excellency\u2019s Government to clarify the issue/s in question.\n\n\u201cWhile awaiting a reply, we urge that all necessary interim measures be taken to prevent any irreparable damage to the life or personal integrity of Mr. Kanu, halt the alleged violations and prevent their re-occurrence and in the event that the investigations support or suggest the allegations to be correct, to ensure the accountability of any person responsible of the alleged violations\u201d.\n\nOn why Kanu\u2019s brother decided to seek UN intervention, the statement said: \u201cFollowing the extraordinary rendition of my older brother, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, I undertook a number of urgent steps within the realm of the international community, particularly in Britain and the United Nations. I worked quietly with my brother\u2019s Special Counsel, Aloy Ejimakor and the Bindmans (my brother\u2019s lawyers in Britain) on a host of muscular interventions aimed at presenting my brother\u2019s case to the international community and facilitating his unconditional release and bringing the culprits of his illegal rendition to account.\n\n\u201cThese interventions were not made known to the general public because the applicable rules, especially that of the United Nations, required them to be kept confidential for sixty days.\n\n\u201cThose sixty days just expired and the United Nations has therefore made public the details of its \u2018Urgent Appeals\u2019 to the Nigerian and Kenyan Governments, which were transmitted since 26th August, 2021. It also has made public an acknowledgment it received on 17th September 2021 from the \u2018Permanent Mission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the United Nations\u2019. Both documents are attached to this Press Release.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this is just the beginning of more United Nations and other global strong actions that would be seen in the coming weeks. While we await for such actions to unfold, we wish to inform the public that we will remain resolute and relentless in bringing the full weight of the international community to bear on the unconditional release of me brother and leader without further delay.\u201d",

Deposit insurance coverage should also be consistent with the deposit insurance system\u2019s public policy objective.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the coverage limits are not designed to be static but subject periodic reviews to ensure that they are consistent with the public policy objectives of the Deposit Insurance System. The Corporation successfully reviewed upward the coverage limits from N50,000 at inception in 1989 to N200,000 in 2006 and N500,000 in 2010.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the Corporation invites you to note that in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the total number of accounts in the deposit money banks stood at 83.0 million; 99.1million; 112.0 million and 128.4 million respectively. Out of these numbers, the N500,000 coverage limit fully covered 99.4%; 97.6%; 97.5% and 97.6% of accounts, respectively. What these figures entail is that only less than 3% of accounts/depositors are not fully covered by the prevailing coverage limits.\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is that in the event of failure of a bank, above 97% of depositors would be fully covered by the Corporation.\n\n\u201cFrom the foregoing statistics, it could be observed that the Corporation\u2019s deposit insurance coverage limits are not only adequate but robust enough to engender confidence in our banking system.\u201d",

Because, the government has put it in the national policy, but, it is important that they also encourage the development of the materials. Critical thinking materials. There should be books, workshops, and critical thinking materials in our schools.\n\n\u201cSo this is my appeal to the Federal government to understand that we already have it in the national policy, but we need one more step which is developing the materials and encouraging the use of critical thinking materials in our schools.\n\n\u201cOne thing is that critical thinking is one of the top skills and recently, the world economic forum identified critical thinking as one of the skills that employers of labour are going to look out for.\n\n\u201cSo, that is number one. Number two, critical thinking is also part of the skills that the national policy on education says that primary education should be encouraged.\n\n\u201cPage 10 of the national policy on education says that the aim of primary education is to encourage the teaching of critical thinking skills.\n\n\u201cBut, we don\u2019t have books that encouraged or helped to cultivate critical thinking skills. What I have done is to help develop critical thinking materials which we are now using as part of critical thinking materials.\n\n\u201cI am the one behind the critical thinking project whose aim is to introduce critical thinking as a subject at primary schools. So, in Oyo State, we have been given a go-ahead to organize workshops in the primary schools with a goal of seeing how this subject could be introduced\u201d.",

In this regard, we are considering to publicly express our concerns in this case in the near future, believing that the wider public should be informed about the implications of these allegations for the enjoyment and exercise of human rights in Kenya and Nigeria.

          "title": "Terrorists: Ohanaeze, MBF, CAN, NINAS, Kaigama, Mogekwu, Kokori, Okorie hit Gumi over comment",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja, Paul Osuyi Asaba, Tony John, Port Harcourt, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu, Tony Osauzo, Benin and Sunday Ani\n\nControversial Islamic cleric and former army officer, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi, has stirred the hornet\u2019s nest with his recent comment that Nigeria would disintegrate if the Federal Government declared bandits as terrorists.\n\nThe statement has drawn anger and condemnations with some tagging him a terrorist or strong supporter of terrorism while others called for his immediate arrest.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Gumi had admitted that the devastation inflicted by rampaging bandits in the North West amounted to terrorism but warned that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s labelling them as such would invite additional consequences that would consume the entire country.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cThe acts the bandits are committing now in NW have gradually over time become tantamount to terrorism because wherever innocent people are fatal victims it\u2019s pure terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe warned that the moment bandits are designated as terrorists, \u201cIslamic for that matter, the direct foreign Jihadist movements will set in in force.\n\n\u201cMany teaming unemployed youths may find it palatable and attractive. Shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 plus AK47 against a \u2018secular\u2019 immoral society where impunity reigns are the magnet for extremists and downtrodden \u2013 the majority of our youth. Already these deadly terrorist groups are fighting for the soul of these bandits.\n\n\u201cThis will give criminality a spiritual cover and remove the stigma of discrediting them with such crimes since now they are fighting a \u2018Jihad\u2019 as they will claim.\u201d\n\nGumi argued that since Boko Haram has already gripped the North-East, separatist agitators in the South-East and South-West would easily seize on the lawlessness sweeping the northern regions.\n\n\u201cNE is already and is still devastated by this madness for over 12 years. If we allow, terror, to set in into these raw na\u00efve unexposed bandits, NW will be in ruins sooner than later.\n\n\u201cAlready IPOB are destroying SE, and Igboho has set the ball of confusion rolling in SW. For those who want to destroy the NW, it\u2019s a good recipe.\u201d\n\nReacting, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo advised that the earlier Nigeria recognised Sheikh Gumi as a security threat, the better for everybody in Nigeria.\n\nThe apex-Igbo group, which spoke through its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia, argued that what Gumi professes as an Islamic cleric is contrary to most of his public statements, especially as it affects the country\u2019s security situation.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, he professes Islam but Islam in itself, is supposed to be a symbol of peace. As an Islamic cleric, his descriptions are sometimes at variance with the role he plays in the society. So, his role is in contradiction to his faith as an Islamic cleric and such a person is more dangerous.\u201d\n\nHe also likened Gumi to a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, saying such persons were more dangerous.\n\nFor the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), which spoke through Dogo Isuwa, its national publicity secretary, if government failed to declare the bandits as terrorists, and treat them as such and bring an end to their evil activities, Nigeria would cease.\n\n\u201cIf the Governor of Kaduna State, where Gumi lives, is asking the Federal Government to declare bandits as terrorists, who is Gumi to say otherwise? And if the government of Kaduna State is serious, then Gumi should not be walking free because he is either a terrorist or supporter of terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also called on government to, as a matter of urgency, arrest Sheikh Gumi.\n\nThe Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS), the umbrella body for self-determination groups in the South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria with Ilana Omo Oodua representing the Yoruba Land, Lower Niger Congress representing the South South and South East and Middle-Belt Rennaissance Movement representing the Middle Belt region, also insisted that bandits should be declared as terrorists.\n\nIn a telephone interview, leader of NINAS, Prof Banji Akintoye, said: \u201cThe same set of people that see Igboho as an enemy of Nigeria are the same people supporting terrorists, masquerading as bandits. You can see that all their claim to national unity is fake.\n\n\u201cWe do not speak for IPOB and we do not have any association with IPOB. Then, IPOB without shooting a gun and without kidnapping anyone, was declared a terrorists\u2019 group, just for staging protests. How much more a group of people that have kidnapped a sitting senator, killed scores of both young and old people. But today, we are being told they should not be declared as terrorists.\n\n\u201cOur position is that the current administration has demonstrated that it is only meant to protect the North. They are planning to ensure that the South serves the North. They are planning to use the resources of the South to develop the North. But they will fail.\n\n\u201cSo, our position under NINAS, which Ilana Omo Oodua is part of is that the bandits, the criminal herders or whatever they called themselves, is a terrorists\u2019 organisation, and should be declared as so. Sheikh Gumi entitled to his own opinion. This is a democracy.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Igbo National Council (INC) described Gumi\u2019s utterance as disturbing and a threat to national security.\n\nPresident of INC, Chilos Godsent, in a statement called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the Islamic cleric on his comment.\n\n\u2022Gumi worse than terrorists\n\nTwo Igbo groups, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and Oke Ndigbo, also hit Gumi, describing him as a known terrorist being pamperd by the Federal Government.\n\nADF\u2019s spokesman, Abia Onyike, said: \u201cA spade must be called by its name. The bandits are terrorists and should be addressed as such. The threat by Sheik Gumni does not hold water. Let the foreign Jihadists come, but let them be isolated in the North where they belong.\u201d\n\nNational Secretary of Igbo rights group, Oke Ndigbo, Damian Udemba said the likes of Gumi should have been questioned by now by the security agencies and possibly isolated and prosecuted for romancing with terrorists.\n\nIn fact, it said that \u201cGumi is promoting terrorism by openly serving as their emissary\u201d.\n\n\u2022CAN, PDP, Kaigama, Mogekwu, Kokori, Wechie fume\n\nWhile cautioning the Sheik to remove sentiments over the issue of designating bandits as terrorists, the Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Ignatius Kaigama, said whether called bandits or terrorists, the fact remained that they are engaged in anti-human crimes and are putting the citizens to great risk and destabilising the nation by creating a terrible situation of insecurity.\n\n\u201cWhat I think Sheikh Gumi and many good Nigerians should do is how do we conquer the situation? How do we fight these terrible crimes? And if he brings good suggestions and other Nigerians bring their own, there will be a solution. But when we begin to appear as if we are taking sides, the problem remains unsolved and I think we shall continue to suffer.\u201d\n\nKaigama further said he hoped that if Sheikh Gumi knew how to get to the bandits and convince them to stop their criminal activities, it would be of great service to the nation.\n\nSimilarly, Bishop of Asaba Diocese of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Justus Mogekwu told Daily Sun in Asaba, Delta State, that no matter what anybody painted them, they (bandits), remained terrorists.\n\n\u201cBandits are terrorists whether the president declares them as such or not, they are terrorists. It also shows the level of hypocrisy among some of our leaders.\n\n\u201cHow can declaring bandits as terrorists would break up Nigeria? I do not understand, as if they are a component part of our existence.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we have a government that do have the welfare of Nigerians, they are more concerned about the foreign jihadist than Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIf the government is waiting for anything to declare them what they are, it means the government is behind them. Nigeria has been under this siege for many years it is only now we are seeing the manifestation of it,\u201d Mogekwu said.\n\nAlso, the Delta State chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Apostle Sylvanus Okorote said Gumi\u2019s statement only revealed what was already obvious, adding that he (Gumi) should stop deceiving himself.\n\n\u201cIf banditry is what united Nigeria, then they can break Nigeria but if banditry is not what united Nigeria, if Nigeria was united as a sovereign nation by God, no matter who is declared a terrorist or declared saint, the country will continue to be.\n\n\u201cSo if he wishes to declare bandits as saints, let him continue to do so. Let the president declare them saints if that is his advice; advising the president to declare bandits as saints. Let him speak up and tell the president to declare them as saints. It is obvious to everybody, the entire world is aware of what the bandits are doing,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer publicity secretary of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Rivers State, and Chairman of Ikwerre Local Government Area, Samuel Nwanosike, and a prominent public analyst, Mr. Livingstone Wechie, saw Gumi\u2019s comment as conspiratorial compromise by the Nigeria state and its security agencies.\n\n\u201cSheikh Gumi has for a period been developing a groundswell of felonious influence that seems to be legitimising terrorism and banditry in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is most disturbing that such a person with his background as a retired military Captain should be using religious blackmail to promote such dangerous and criminal ideology.\n\n\u201cThe comments credited to Sheikh Gumi warning that the categorisation of bandits as terrorists will mean the end of Nigeria smacks of conspiratorial compromise by the Nigerian state and its forces. It indicates that the Federal Government may have surrendered to the antics of the self-made ambassador of terrorists and bandits.\n\n\u201cIt is very surprising that Gumi who now enjoys unfettered communication access to the insurgents to the point of middle-manning for the release of abductees, has acquired the ultimate right to dictate the paradigm on the war on insecurity and remains untouchable, whether advertently or otherwise, by the Nigerian government.\n\nFormer General Secretary of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), Chief Frank Kokori, advised Nigerians to ignore Gumi, and see him as a religious fundamentalist. \u201cWho is Gumi? He is just a religious fundamentalist, whose views are always at the extreme and at variance with the views held by the liberal Islamists,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Okorie, Uwazuruike, Ehikhamenor react\n\nOne of the stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South East zone, Chief Chekwas Okorie said it was baffling why Nigerian government was allowing him (Gumi) to make such reckless statements without being question or brought to book.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what gives Sheikh Gumi the confidence to talk the way he talks and sometimes threatens the stability of Nigeria and government will allow him to continue to behave and talk recklessly.\n\nFormer president of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike said he was not surprised by Gumi\u2019s statement.\n\nHe said the only way for Nigeria to understand the trajectory of what the bandits are is to classify them as terrorists and that it was tomfoolery not to do so.\n\nIn his reaction, professor at the University of Benin, Prof. Edeaghe Ehikhamenor, expressed surprise that Sheik Gumi could speak with audacity with nobody cautioning him.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "summary": "\u201cIf the Governor of Kaduna State, where Gumi lives, is asking the Federal Government to declare bandits as terrorists, who is Gumi to say otherwise?\nHe also called on government to, as a matter of urgency, arrest Sheikh Gumi.\n\u201cWhat I think Sheikh Gumi and many good Nigerians should do is how do we conquer the situation?\n\u201cSo if he wishes to declare bandits as saints, let him continue to do so.\nLet the president declare them saints if that is his advice; advising the president to declare bandits as saints.",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, and the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Mohammed, have flayed the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) for keeping silent on the crisis confronting the nation and assault on judiciary.\n\nThey spoke at the opening ceremony of the 2021 annual general conference of the NBA with the theme: \u201cTake the Lead,\u201d going in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nGovernor Wike wondered why NBA had remained silent when economic, social and political rights, including the rights to personal security, freedom of speech, association, dissent and peaceful protests, as well as the rights to personal liberty, were being violated with impunity by the present central administration and its security agencies.\n\nWike said: \u201cProfession and as a pluralistic assemblage of learned men, the NBA has greater responsibility to promote and protect the rights of Nigerians at all times and in all circumstances.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cBut, the central question is whether the NBA has been living up to its credo and responsibility? While I would leave us to be the judge, my own personal conclusion is that, for years now, the NBA has focused less on promoting and fighting for the values of good governance, democracy, judicial independence, human rights and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the concerning facts. Never in our political history has Nigeria been so badly governed and denied of good governance with the Federal Government woefully failing in its basic duties to provide for the wellbeing and security of its own citizens, as we have experienced in the last six years.\n\n\u201cOn daily basis, the economic, social and political rights, including the rights to personal security, freedom of speech, association, dissent and peaceful protests, as well as the right to personal liberty are being violated with impunity by the present central administration and its security apparatus.\n\n\u201cThe invasion on personal liberty has been brazen and indiscriminate, such that even judges of the superior courts, including Supreme Court justices, have in the recent past, been victims of midnight assaults on their premises and subjection to unlawful arrests and imprisonments.\n\n\u201cLately, the new devious trend is to tag security risks to innocent Nigerians and opposition elements and use the immigration authority to seize their international passports without a prior court order.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the chief justice, who was represented by a Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Peter-Odili, said it was regrettable that some members of the Bar join litigants to assault the institution of the judiciary when their cases were not met.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs head of the judiciary, I have tasked all our justices and judges to take up the challenge pushed at us by the times. At various fora, I have encouraged my brother judges and justices to see the administration of justice and one of the fundamental solutions to some of the nation\u2019s crisis.\n\n\u201cThe peace of the nation rests on the balance of scale of justice, and our courts must ensure justice is served at all times irrespective of the pressures from within. This is not to say there are no challenges plaguing the administration of justice in the country.\n\n\u201cI must state that all challenges of the judiciary can be internally addressed; some demand the support of the Bar for their actualisation. One of them is the poor condition of service for national judicial officers. Members of the Bar and various arms of government must see the urgency of leading a crusade to address the issue as a matter of urgency.\n\n\u201cAnother challenge being faced by the judiciary is the assault by litigants against the institution of the judiciary when their cases are not met. Unfortunately, some members of the Bar also join them in ridiculing our courts in their private discussions and on national dailies.\n\n\u201cThe institution of our courts is sacred and the respect that people have for it is the one that ministers in the temple of justice have made the people realise must be accorded to it. When the judges, who do not have a right of reply are subjected to dispiriting and humiliating comments in the media, it silently kills their moral and dedication to the cause of justice. I, therefore, urge the Bar to rise in defence of the Bench at all times.\u201d\n\nDeputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, said there would be no meaningful development of the laws of the country without collaboration between the Bar and lawmakers at all levels in the country.\n\nOmo-Agege said: \u201cThe NBA should take the lead in promoting and protecting human rights, the rule of law and good governance in Nigeria, as well as promoting the welfare, security and professional advancement of legal practitioners in Nigeria. I wish, therefore, on behalf of the Senate and, in deed, the National Assembly thank the NBA for organising this conference.\n\n\u201cThis is indeed the era when legal practitioners ought to be at the forefront of the development of this nation for the benefit of all. The National Assembly has taken the lead in enacting laws to give legal teeth to some provisions of fundamental objectives and directing principles of state policies.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, our attention has been focused on enthronement of free and fair electoral process to good and accountable governance. The National Assembly is also in the process of concluding work on far-reaching proposals to alter the 1999 Constitution to meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians\u2026.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Politicians Still Influencing Judges to Use Court against Democracy",
          "text": "Alexander Enumah\n\nWeeks after the Chief Justice of Nigeria (NJC), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, who was angered by conflicting orders from courts of coordinate jurisdictions, issued a stern warning to judges on the need to act right in nation\u2019s interest, it appears an end is not in sight yet to the impunity of some of the judges and justices in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, the unsavoury dispositions of some of the justices and judges to democratic concerns, have continued to decimate the gains of the nation\u2019s 23 years of unbroken civil rule. Even when they know full well they lack the jurisdiction to entertain the matters, they still go ahead to hear and pronounce ruling, which becomes an albatross on the neck of the party it was obtained against.\n\nThe submission of a majority of the people is that if the trend persisted, the fourth republic, which prides itself as the longest in the history of Nigeria\u2019s democracy, might come to an abrupt end going by the recent activities of desperate politicians and their cohorts in the judiciary.\n\nOne of the recent indicators to this unending judicial rascality could be located in how some individuals had rushed to court to stop the forthcoming national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the manner the courts have been encouraging the resort to destabilisation.\n\nNational Convention Organising Committee (NCOC) of the PDP raised the alarm about a suit filed at the Kaduna High Court, ostensibly to derail the October 30 and 31 national convention and advised party members to be wary of such disgruntled and misguided members of the party.\n\nAlthough details of the suit have remained sketchy, it was allegedly filed by an aide to a former Vice President, Namadi Sambo. But the aide, said to be close to Secondus, has however denied having anything to do with the suit.\n\nSecretary of the NCOC and Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, said, \u201cNotwithstanding their right to approach a court of competent jurisdiction to air their grievances, we maintain that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the PDP has acted in good faith in fixing our convention for October 30 and 31. It is not meant to witch-hunt anyone or to truncate anyone\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on all members and supporters of the PDP to ignore this distraction as we prepare to host a convention that will send a clear signal to Nigerians that the PDP is the only party that has the will and the might to rescue Nigeria from the catastrophe that we have been enduring for the past six years.\u201d\n\nBut Secondus had through his lawyer, Mr Tayo Oyetiba, SAN, asked the PDP to shelve the planned convention slated for October 30 and 31, pending the determination of Secondus\u2019 appeal.\n\nThe appeal with the number CA/PH/341/2021, is seeking to quash his suspension and applied for \u201cAn order of injunction restraining the Peoples Democratic Party, the 6 respondent herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30th and 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\u201d\n\nThe hearing of the appeal as well as the motion for interlocutory injunction comes up today, Tuesday, October 26, at the Port Harcourt Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\nWhether the appellate court would accede to the demand or not is another, particularly, taking into consideration the recent position of appellate court justices with respect to exparte granted by High Court judges.\n\nIt is worthy of mention that the appellate court and even the Supreme Court had descended heavily on the High Court judges particularly, in the Anambra governorship suits.\n\nJustice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of the Court of Appeal had in a ruling on August 2, in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), governorship tussle, called for sanction against two judges in the Jigawa and Imo States High Court for what she described as professional misconduct. She also called for sanctions for lawyers, who aided politicians in the filing of all such applications that had brought the court to ridicule.\n\nSimilarly, Justice Hamma Zamani of the Kano Division of the Court of Appeal had on August 10 in his judgment, set aside the judgment of a Jigawa State High Court, which had earlier declared Jude Okeke and Chukwuma Umeoji as the APGA national chairman and governorship candidate respectively.\n\nThe appellate court claimed that the trial court erred by entertaining a suit wherein it lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, also in a judgment on October 14, 2021, upheld the decision of Justice Zamani of the Kano division of the Appeal Court for nullifying the judgment of the High Court for want of jurisdiction.\n\nThe apex court in a unanimous judgment held that the internal issue of political parties\u2019 was outside the jurisdiction of courts and consequently upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which resolved the leadership tussle in APGA in favour of Victor Oye and also upheld the primary election conducted by his leadership, which produced Professor Chukwuma Soludo as APGA\u2019s governorship candidate for the November 6 governorship election.\n\nSoludo was nominated candidate of APGA in the forthcoming governorship poll by the Oye faction and his nomination was accepted by INEC. But Okeke challenged the authenticity of the Oye leadership at a Federal High Court in Jigawa State, where judgment was given in his favour.\n\nHowever, the Jigawa Judgment was set aside by the Appeal Court leading him to proceed to the apex court to upturn the appellate court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe seven member panel of the apex court in the judgment delivered by Justice Mary Odili, held that it was clear that the appellant engaged in abuse of judicial process, because the subject matter of the suit was not justiciable as it bordered on the internal matters of a political party.\n\nWhile the panel berated lawyers to the appellant for engaging in unethical conduct by filing such suit in the first place, it blamed the Jigawa High Court judge for accepting to hear the suit that was outside his jurisdiction. The panel went on to slam a fine of N1 million against the appellant for abuse of court process.\n\nAside the judges, the umbrella body for lawyers, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), had also condemned the development and promised to deal with lawyers engaging in acts capable of bringing the judiciary to disrepute.\n\nA statement by its National President in September, Mr. Olumide Akpata, described as unfortunate, the recurring trend of contradictory court orders especially amongst courts of coordinate jurisdiction. He cited the recent cases involving the Anambra State forthcoming election and the PDP leadership crisis, which according to him \u201cevokes memories of those eerie and unwanted dark days.\n\n\u201cWhile the NBA will continue to stay away from the political ramifications and machinations involved in these matters, it is self-evident that these developments in our courts are antithetical to the actualisation of the just society and independent judiciary that we all aspire to, and they run contrary to everything we teach and hold dear as a profession.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a swirling belief that of the three judges under probe, one or two were involved in the PDP leadership crisis suit. While Justice O. Gbasam of a High Court of Rivers State, had on August 23, 2021 issued an order of interim injunction restraining Secondus from carrying on as Chairman of the PDP, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office, Justice Nusirat Umar of the Kebbi State High Court, issued another order on Secondus to return to his position as the National Chairman on August 26.\n\nThe judge made the order while delivering ruling in a suit marked KB/AC/M. 170/2021, filed by three concerned members of the party, Yahaya Usman, Abubakar mohammed and Bashar Suleman.\n\nJustice Umar said she was satisfied after reading the affavidit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\nBut before Secondus could carry out the order, Justice Edem Kooffreh of a Cross River State High Court on August 28, restrained him from resuming.\n\nThe amusing thing about all the orders is that they were not only issued by courts of coordinate jurisdiction, but were all based on exparte applications.\n\nAttempt to rid the judiciary of bad eggs started, when the National Judicial Council (NJC) under the chairmanship of the CJN, constituted an investigative panel to probe the three High Court judges over their alleged indiscriminate issuance of court orders, an act perceived as detrimental to the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nA statement by the Director of Information, NJC, Mr Soji Oye, read, \u201cThe National Judicial Council under the Chairmanship of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice I. T. Muhammad, at its 95th Meeting held on September 15 and 16, 2021, in line with the principles of fair hearing, has directed the three Judges of coordinate jurisdiction, who granted Exparte Orders over the same case with the same subject matter to appear before a special Investigation Committee constituted by the Council in order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for such act\u201d.\n\nAlthough, the names of the judges and the jurisdiction they operated were not made public, they were however believed to be amongst the six jurisdictions of the High Court whose heads were summoned by the CJN in August, to explain the rationale behind the issuance of conflicting others by judges in their jurisdiction.\n\nThe letter dated August 30, read in part: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to media reports to the effect that some Courts of coordinate jurisdiction were granting conflicting Exparte Orders on the same subject matter.\n\n\u201cIt has become expedient for me to invite you for a detailed briefing on the development. This is even more compelling having regard to earlier NJC Warning to judicial officers on the need to be circumspect in granting Ex-parte applications\u201d.\n\nFrom the tone of the letter, it was obvious that the CJN was not only worried but also bitter over the development, which sources around the CJN noted was a huge embarrassment tothe Nigerian judiciary and the country at large.\n\nSpeaking on the ongoing probe of the three judges on Monday in Abuja, an official of the NJC, who did not want his name mentioned, said the probe was ongoing and once the committee concluded its job, which he believed was in no distant time, the council would look into it and take critical decisions to serve as a warning to others if the said judges were guilty of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe committee is still sitting, you know they have to give them fair hearing, they will bring their lawyers to defend them, afterwards the committee will now recommend them to the plenary of the NJC. It is the NEC meeting that will determine, whatever the plenary agrees is the final decision,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it is difficult to comprehend what would make a judge assume jurisdiction in a case he knew he lacked any, the level of condemnation and fines against politicians and their lawyers by the appellate and Supreme Courts, have yet to abate the obnoxious situation in the judiciary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Whether the appellate court would accede to the demand or not is another, particularly, taking into consideration the recent position of appellate court justices with respect to exparte granted by High Court judges.\nIt is worthy of mention that the appellate court and even the Supreme Court had descended heavily on the High Court judges particularly, in the Anambra governorship suits.\nThe appellate court claimed that the trial court erred by entertaining a suit wherein it lacked jurisdiction.\nBut Okeke challenged the authenticity of the Oye leadership at a Federal High Court in Jigawa State, where judgment was given in his favour.\nBut before Secondus could carry out the order, Justice Edem Kooffreh of a Cross River State High Court on August 28, restrained him from resuming.",

          "text": "\u2022President says with digital currency, GDP will rise by $29bn in 10 years\n\n\u2022Nigeria first country to launch electronic money in Africa\n\n\u2022Emefiele: new intervention will jumpstart productive base of economy \u2022Reiterates Nigeria cannot fritter FX on cheap imports, currency speculators\n\nDeji Elumoye, James Emejo and Sonia Mayomi in Abuja\n\nIn line with efforts to enhance the payment system and boost transactions, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday launched the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), also known as eNaira, in Abuja. This was as Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, unveiled a new financial instrument tagged, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity,\u201d meant to stimulate activities in private sector companies in the country that would be selected.\n\nBuhari said during the launch of the digital currency that with the introduction of eNaira, the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was projected to rise by $29 billion in the next 10 years. He stressed that Nigeria was the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of CBDC and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by US$29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make monetary policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\u201d\n\nThe president assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC. He disclosed that the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began in 2017.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System.\u201d\n\nThe president also explained why he supported the initiative, saying in recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline.\n\nThe decline was exacerbated by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new digital economy, stressed.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that central banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u2018private currencies\u2019 that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of central banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payment.\n\n\u201cA handful of countries, including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia, have already issued their own CBDCs. A 2021 survey of central banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 per cent were experimenting with the technology, and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201dIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira.\u201d\n\nThe president also said CBN\u2019s reputation as a leading innovator, \u201cin the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions,\u201d inspired him to approve eNaira.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s apex bank had invested heavily in creating a payment system that was ranked in the top 10 in the world and, certainly, the best in Africa.\n\nBuhari explained, \u201cThis payment system now provides high-value and time-critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey have also supported several private-sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said with the new initiative, CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinise and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from November 1. Under the initiative, the CBN governor said, a new set of 100 companies would be rolled out every 100 days and their names would be published in the national dailies for Nigerians to see and confirm.\n\nHe said the new initiative would be managed by the CBN Development Finance Department, under his direct supervision.\n\nThe CBN governor pointed out that the initiative would be the best and most sustainable way to strengthen the value of the naira, insisting that what the country requires is production and more production.\n\nEmefiele explained, \u201cWorking through banks, the financial instrument will be available to their customers in critical areas to boost the production and productivity, and to immediately transform and jumpstart the productive base of the economy.\n\n\u201cAfter these 100 projects by companies in the first 100 days from November 1, we will take the next 100 companies/projects for another 100 days beginning February 1, 2022, and then another 100 companies for another 100 days beginning from May 1, 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said the instrument was part of measures to reverse the country\u2019s overreliance on imports, adding that the country cannot afford to waste its reserves on cheap imports and currency speculators.\n\nEmefiele also assured that there was no cause for alarm over foreign exchange (FX) availability in the country, pointing out that the country\u2019s FX reserves are strong and, \u201cindeed, getting stronger by the day, crossing the $40 billion mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing.\u201d\n\nOn the bank\u2019s latest intervention to support companies, the CBN governor said, \u201cWe believe that if we target and support the right companies and projects, we will see a significant, measurable and verifiable increase in local production and productivity, reduction in certain imports, increase in non-oil exports, and improvements in the FX-generating capacity of the economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated that the current challenges with the country\u2019s exchange rate started since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market. He said the local currency had been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\nHe said about 35 years later, Nigeria had not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\n\u201cInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which have wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele queried, \u201cWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation, such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must return to massive home-made production; we must get our people working again. We must create the economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor said the country must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\u201cIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery \u2013 we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly.\u201d\n\nHe said the 100 PPP policy was in addition to other policies and interventions of the CBN meant to support the economy, especially, through the trying times of COVID-19.\n\nEmefiele said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017. He said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and the fast growing payment platforms.\n\nCBN decided to implement its own CBDC and to name the digital currency eNaira, with the expectation that the innovation would make significant positive difference to Nigeria and Nigerians, he stated.\n\nEmefiele said the eNaira would support a resilient payment ecosystem, encourage rapid financial inclusion, reduce the cost of processing cash, enable direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens and increase revenue and tax collection.\n\nHe said eNaira would also facilitate diaspora remittances, reduce the cost of financial transactions, and improve the efficiency of payments.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cTherefore, the eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same naira with far more possibilities.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira \u2013 like the physical naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at one naira to one eNaira.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said in a bid to further de-risk the process, CBN had given careful consideration to the entire payment and financial architecture and designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems. He said the bank had also implemented safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe CBN boss added that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nHe said since the eNaira platform went live, there had been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and others across the world, with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nAccording to him, 33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform while N500 million had been successfully minted by the central bank, including N200 million, which had been issued to financial institutions.\n\nEmefiele said over 2,000 customers have been on-boarded while120 merchants had successfully registered on the eNaira platform.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday, customers who download the eNaira Speed Wallet App will be able to perform the following: Onboard and create their wallet, fund their eNaira wallet from their bank account, transfer eNaira from their wallet to another wallet, and make payment for purchases at registered merchant locations.\u201d\n\nEmefiele acknowledged there was a continuing debate on the true value of the naira, adding, \u201crather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyse how we got here, in the first place.\u201d\n\nHe commended the CBN staff that worked tirelessly to deliver on the central bank\u2019s numerous projects.\n\nSpeaking further in an interview with THISDAY, Emefiele said, \u201cWe would not embark on a project where we have not really dimensioned the risks; you identify risks and you now measure the risks and then we think about how to manage the risks and we have looked at it.\n\n\u201cThere is no need, absolutely no reason for anybody to be afraid of the risk of even hacking your account and the rest of that.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis morning I set up my account and my account is operating very well. I talked about the BVN; the BVN is one of the best payment systems infrastructure that we have put in place and I can assure you that with all that has been done, you cannot hack into it.\n\n\u201cIf somebody hacks into yours, it will be because you were reckless in handling your information but not that the system failed.\u201d\n\nHe described eNaira as an extension of the payment system in Nigeria, which would enhance payments outside the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou can make payment for goods and services rendered to somebody who even resides outside the country as long as he is willing to accept Naira.\n\n\u201cWe will see eventually that what it does is that your reliance on third currency would be reduced by embracing eNaira. That is one area that I am looking forward to, how this would help our country.\u201d\n\nCBN Waives Charges on eNaira Transactions for 90 Days\n\nCBN yesterday said charges for transactions that originate from its eNaira platform would be free from charges for the first 90 days, commencing October 25. The bank noted that it would, thereafter, revert to applicable charges as outlined in the Guide to Charges by Banks, Other Financial and Non-bank Financial Institutions.\n\nThis was revealed in a circular on the Regulatory Guidelines on the eNaira, dated October 25, 2021, which was signed by the apex bank\u2019s Director, Financial Policy and Regulations Department, Chibuzo Efobi, and addressed to all stakeholders.\n\nCBN restated in the circular that the digital currency would complement cash as a less costly, more efficient, generally accepted, safe and trusted means of payment and store of value.\n\nIt added that the eNaira would also improve monetary policy effectiveness, enhance government\u2019s capacity to deoy targeted social interventions, provide alternative less costly channels for collection of government revenue and boost remittances through formal channels.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the guidelines further seek to provide simplicity in the operation of the eNaira, encourage general acceptability and use, promote low cost of transactions, drive financial inclusion, while minimising inherent risks of disintermediation or any negative impact of the system.\n\nThe eNaira wallet is required to access, use and hold eNaira, which will be exchangeable for other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC).\n\nThe CBN added that the AML/CFT checks for fraud prevention and detection would apply on the eNaira platform.\n\nHence, financial institutions are required to comply with the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011 (as amended), the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 (as amended) and all subsisting anti-money laundering laws and regulations as may be issued by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUnder the new system, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) may receive revenue in eNaira; and make payments in same form.\n\nIt added that users of the eNaira would be introduced to a tiered structure with transaction and balance limits.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022We\u2019re determined to proceed with election, says INEC\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nThe National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno, yesterday, warned that nobody or group should test the resolve by the federal government to guarantee the November 6 gubernatorial election in Anambra State.\n\nThe NSA, who spoke at a meeting of inter-security agencies for the elections, where the INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu also said the commission was determined to ensure that the Anambra election takes place as scheduled, because according to him, 12 out of 14 items had already taken place.\n\nAlso, a coalition of civil society organisations based in the South-east has waded into alleged plans by separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to disrupt the forthcoming Anambra governorship election slated for November 6.\n\nMonguno, who was the co-chairman of election security in Nigeria, spoke against the backdrop of threat by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to disrupt the exercise and warned that, \u201cFor those of us in security, we have already done what we are supposed to do.\n\n\u201cAll security agencies have been asked to conduct themselves well in a professional manner and exhibit the highest level of professionalism and restraint and operate within the confines of the law, not in any way that will jeopardise the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are going to ensure that the people of Anambra undergo this exercise without any incident. We want to offer brotherly advice to our brothers, who want to destabilise the process to think again. We are all eager to achieve results that will be acceptable to everybody. I don\u2019t think it will be right for anyone to ignite crisis. Please, think again.\n\n\u201cYes, the law enforcement agencies will not sit by and allow people terrorise people, commit homicide. They have been told to watched out for these elements. I am appealing to you to stay in your wards and local governments and behave yourself. Anyone that wants to disrupt the process will be brought to book,\u201d the NSA warned.\n\nReiterating the importance of the November 6 governorship election, Monguno said, \u201cWe all know how important it is for us. Election is number one legitimate right of every citizen and we must not deny them that right in an atmosphere devoid of rancour and violence. Just like the chairman said, we need to do better than what we did in Edo and Ondo,\u201d he declared.\n\nOn the casualties so far suffered by security agencies and INEC staff in Anambra State, the NSA said, \u201cI know you have gone through a lot of pains, but don\u2019t allow that to dampen your spirit or get into lethargy. I wish you fruitful deliberations.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman, speaking earlier, said, \u201cOur deployment of non-sensitive materials and training of personnel for the election have virtually been concluded. The Commission has successfully accomplished 12 out of the 14 activities listed in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the election released in January this year.\n\n\u201cThe two outstanding activities are the last day of campaign, at midnight on Thursday 4th November 2021 and Election Day, which remains Saturday 6th November 2021. The REC for Anambra State is here to fully provide an update on the implementation of other activities and INEC\u2019s general state of readiness for the election.\n\n\u201cINEC is determined to proceed with the Anambra State Governorship election as scheduled. The safety and protection of voters, our personnel, accredited observers, the media and materials are cardinal considerations in any election. We have been assured by the security agencies of a secure environment for the election.\n\n\u201cI am sure the Commissioner Police, Anambra State, in his briefing, will provide more details regarding preparations on the ground. I wish to place on record the continued support of security agencies to the Commission during elections. Particularly noteworthy is the high level of professional conduct of the agencies in the last two major elections in Edo and Ondo States. Indeed, Edo and Ondo have become the standard for securing elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe professionalism and neutrality exhibited by the security agencies in the two elections have been widely praised nationally and internationally. We are confident that this will be replicated in Anambra State,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nHe, therefore, commended the security agencies for the support INEC had received from religious, traditional and community leaders for peaceful elections.\n\nHe said the commission was also working with the National Peace Committee under the leadership of a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, to bring all political parties and candidates for the Anambra State Governorship election to commit to peace before, during and after the election.\n\nYakubu later introduced two national commissioners sworn in yesterday. They are Kunle Cornelius Ajayi, a Professor of Political Science at the Ekiti State University and Muhammad Sani Kallah, a retired Professor of Ecology and Range Management at the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. They are the new national commissioners representing the South West and North West geo-political zones respectively.\n\nBut the civil society groups in the South-east, under the umbrella of Coalition of Southeast Democracy and Human Rights Organisations (CSBDHROs) said the action of the separatist group was targeted at the Anambra election.\n\nAddressing newsmen yesterday in Enugu at an International Press Conference, the organisations said disrupting the Anambra election would not be of any benefit to their struggle, rather, it would aid emergency rule, that would not be to the advantage of Anambra people.\n\nChairman Board of Trustees of International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr Emeka Umeagbalasi, who addressed journalists on behalf of other rights organisations, called on IPOB to rescind their decision, while also calling for the release of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on our brothers (IPOB) not to toe that line (disrupting election). When a group tells you that they will lockdown the South East from November 4 to November 10, and we know that Anambra has election on November 6 and November 7, what does that tell you? The election is the target.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell the IPOB people that nobody knows it all. We have been fighting their cause for a long time, because we know that what they are doing is within their fundamental human right. But we want to tell them that once in a while, they should make consultations.\n\n\u201cThey should sometimes reach out to people like us.

Our faith in our Armed Forces remains unshaken and as a government we will do all within our powers to ensure that our Armed Forces are motivated to perform optimally.\n\n\u201dThey have time and again demonstrated unparalleled patriotism, courage, loyalty and commitment as they grapple with the daunting challenges of defending Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari described the emblem as a sign of the sacrifices and blood shed by officers and men of the Armed Forces for peace and security of Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIt is also a sign of our resolve to remain united as a nation and confront any challenges we may face. It is a sign of our resolve to say no to divisions and embrace one another as a united indivisible country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president called on all Nigerians to make generous donations to the Nigerian Legion, support the widows and orphans of the fallen heroes, procure the emblems and wear them with pride.\n\n\u201cThe same call goes to all visitors and friends of Nigeria as well as corporate bodies operating in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Nigerian Legion, the president noted that the need to maintain the comradeship that existed during the service among officers and men of the Armed Forces led to its establishment through an Act of the National Assembly.\n\nHe commended the Nigerian Legion for living up to its mandate of catering for the welfare of ex-servicemen and those that distinguished themselves in the wars Nigeria participated in.\n\nThe president stated that the veterans\u2019 organisation has remained a veritable pool of abundant and diverse human resources.\n\n\u201dI have the pleasure to acknowledge the contributions of retired officers and men of the Nigerian Armed Forces to the ongoing war on insurgency.\n\n\u201dThe government will continue to welcome these vital contributions. I charge the Ministry of Defence to continue to promote the engagement of our retired officers and men in seeking avenues of contributing to our national affairs.\n\n\u201dI am glad to note that the Nigerian veterans have contributed to the socioeconomic development of our country through engagement in productive ventures thereby generating employment opportunities for themselves and other Nigerians.\n\n\u201dThis is a further testimonial to the patriotism of these Nigerians. They have demonstrated abiding faith in Nigeria and its development. We sincerely commend them and all Nigerians who have continued to believe in Nigeria by making it their investment destination,\u201d he said.\n\nSee Images\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian police authorities have come under immense pressure from top government officials, monarchs and ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftains to clear suspended commander of the IGP Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Abba Kyari after an investigation into alleged infractions committed by the disgraced police officer.\n\nOn August 26, Usman Baba, Inspector-General of Police (IGP) received the report of the panel set up to probe the bribery allegations against Kyari, over his relationship with Hushpuppi, the self-confessed international fraudster.\n\nAn FBI agent, Andrew Innocenti, had in a document titled, \u2018Criminal Complaint By Telephone Or Other Reliable Electronic Means\u2019 filed before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleged that a suspected fraudster, Abass Ramon, aka Hushpuppi, contracted Kyari to detain a co-conspirator, Chibuzo Vincent, for threatening to expose the alleged $1.1 million fraud committed against a Qatari businessman. See Also Police Probe Report: Nigeria Police Query Disgraced Officer, Abba Kyari Over Communications With Suspected Fraudster, Hushpuppi\n\nThe agency said Hushpuppi paid $20,600 into a bank account provided by Kyari.\n\nThe Police Service Commission (PSC) had suspended Kyari from office as a Deputy Commissioner of Police and head of the IRT based on the recommendation of the IGP.\n\nIt was gathered that the DIG Joseph Egbunike-led panel, which submitted its report in August, established that there were infractions on the part of Kyari in his communications with Hushpuppi but sources told SaharaReporters that the police authorities are being pressured to clear him of wrongdoings. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Hushpuppi: Police Panel Recommends Demotion For Disgraced DCP, Abba Kyari To Prevent His Extradition To US\n\n\u201cPolice authorities are being pressured to clear Kyari; those campaigning for him claim he is the only one who can find a solution to the insecurity in South-East,\u201d a police source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that one of the influential Nigerians working behind the scenes to ensure Kyari is off the hook is the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\n\"Not only some influential Nigerians, even Malami (AGF) also wants to clear Abba Kyari,\" another top source said.\n\nIt was also learnt that a massive publicity campaign had been launched to call for his reinstatement and get him off the hook. See Also Police Hushpuppi: Police Panel Submits \u2018Damning Report\u2019 On Disgraced DCP, Abba Kyari\n\nSuch campaigners have seen social media as a veritable tool to deploy to sway the mind of the police authorities and the public.\n\nFor instance, a political pressure group, Concerned Advocates For Good Governance (CAGC), recently said it had consulted US-based law firms to defend Kyari.\n\n\u201cWe have diligently consulted with about three notable law firms in the United States to give us their legal opinions on what can be done to formidably defend Abba Kyari,\u201d Olusegun Bamgbose, the President-General of CAGC had said.\n\n\u201cOne of the leading firms has replied to us and gone ahead to send us the indictment against Abba Kyari and other details which is about 26 pages.\n\n\u201cThe reputable law firm, well-grounded on extradition issues, has assured us of their readiness to represent Kyari\u2019s interest before and after his possible extradition to the US.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a chieftain of the ruling APC and Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe recently alleged that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), its security wing, Eastern Security Network (ESN) and bandits have been capitalising on Kyari absence to wreak havoc in the country, particularly in the South-East.\n\nHe posted on Facebook, \"FEDERAL GOVERNMENT biko, WE WANT ABBA KYARI BACK IN THE SOUTH EAST. IT LOOKS AS IF IPOB & EASTERN SECURITY NETWORK, BANDITS ARE CELEBRATING HIS EXIT. WE NEED HIM BACK BY ALL MEANS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\u201d\n\nAnother Facebook user wrote, \u201cPlease @\u2068BisongOnonye\u2069, can Abba Kyari be restored to the Nigeria Police? The mayhem and heinous crimes being committed with impunity down the South East is alarming and needs his attention.\n\n\u201cThe current Man in charge in my humble opinion is finding Abba's shoes too big to fill. The South East is currently nosediving into a 'failed region'. May God Save My Home Land.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, Chinedum Agwaramgbo said, \"Pls ABBA KYARI should be re-instated! I don't really care now about the allegations against him...which are only basically that - unproven allegations! South East is in danger of imploding! BRING ABBA KYARI BACK!\"\n\nAnd in response to Agwaramgbo, one Bond Chris Ohuche said, \"So no other police officer is capable? Alright, why not ask for the disbandment of the entire police force since it can't perform without one man?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the probe panel set up to investigate Kyari has since August submitted a compromised report.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that the panel found Kyari guilty of some infractions after its investigation but recommended that Kyari should be demoted and not dismissed. See Also Police Abba Kyari Asked Me To Pay The Proceed Of Hotel Owned By Kidnap Kingpin Into My Bank Account \u2014 Police Lawyer\n\nTop sources in the Nigeria Police Force had told SaharaReporters that the plot by the police authorities to hand Kyari a demotion was to frustrate his much anticipated extradition to the United States.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that the probe panel set up by the IGP after three weeks of dilly-dallying turned in its report on the alleged indictment of Kyari by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nCompetent sources however revealed that what the panel recommended to the IGP was a demotion \u2013 the report which would form the basis of what the Police Service Commission would act upon.\n\n\u201cThe police report on Abba Kyari only recommends demotion to a lower rank. They figured that he could be extradited if dismissed. Kyari\u2019s real enemies are at the police service commission and what they want is an outright dismissal.\n\n\u201cBut they have to defer to the IGP. The IGP is no doubt Kyari\u2019s godfather. So we are waiting to see what he would approve,\u201d a top source had revealed.",

Advertisement The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which is currently the sole importer of petrol, has been deducting subsidy payments from oil and gas proceeds due to the three tiers of government since there is no provision for it in the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cIn our 2022 budget, we only factored in subsidy for the first half of the year; the second half of the year, we are looking at complete deregulation of the sector, saving foreign exchange and potentially earning more from the oil and gas industry,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking at the session, Doyin Salami, chairman of the economic advisory council (EAC), said he had argued for a long time that the subsidy needed to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said that the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) made the payment of subsidy of petrol illegal.\n\n\u201cWith the PIA essentially it makes illegal petrol subsidy and yes, there is a period where NNPC and the new regulatory agencies must calibrate themselves, but at the end of this period \u2013 and I think it is about six months, which explains why the minister has said for the first half of the year, there is a provision,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy view will be if we could get it done sooner than that, it will be excellent. It releases money. The key point is simply this: we are now, any which way, at the tail end of that conversation, except if we choose not to obey the law. My sense is we will obey the law and subsidy will be gone.\u201d",

Advertisement The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which is currently the sole importer of petrol, has been deducting subsidy payments from oil and gas proceeds due to the three tiers of government since there is no provision for it in the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cIn our 2022 budget, we only factored in subsidy for the first half of the year; the second half of the year, we are looking at complete deregulation of the sector, saving foreign exchange and potentially earning more from the oil and gas industry,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking at the session, Doyin Salami, chairman of the economic advisory council (EAC), said he had argued for a long time that the subsidy needed to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said that the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) made the payment of subsidy of petrol illegal.\n\n\u201cWith the PIA essentially it makes illegal petrol subsidy and yes, there is a period where NNPC and the new regulatory agencies must calibrate themselves, but at the end of this period \u2013 and I think it is about six months, which explains why the minister has said for the first half of the year, there is a provision,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy view will be if we could get it done sooner than that, it will be excellent. It releases money. The key point is simply this: we are now, any which way, at the tail end of that conversation, except if we choose not to obey the law.

This followed \u201cimpressive growth\u201d in the usage of the Africa eShop app, Hennie Heymans, CEO of DHL Express Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) said at the time. By August of 2019, the platform had been rolled out to 34 countries across SSA.\n\nOnce considered a threat to leading e-commerce players in Africa, DHL\u2019s eShop offered relatively faster delivery compared to its peers but was also one of the most expensive platforms for international shopping, some of its users told TechCabal.\n\nDHL is closing down its Africa eShop. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nHowever, for reasons not stated, eShop has now been delisted from mobile application stores and some features on the platform have been disabled as DHL moves to shut down the service on October 30.\n\nIt is not immediately clear if the company is closing its eShop operations in other regions too, such as the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\n\nTechCabal reached out to DHL Africa for answers but has yet to receive a response at the time of publication.\n\nHi, unfortunately the eShop is closing 30 October.

          "title": "How Koa is helping Kenyans build and manage wealth",
          "text": "Despite being the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa and East Africa\u2019s financial and commercial hub, Kenya has a savings rate of 12%, lowest in East Africa\u2014way below Africa\u2019s average of 17%.\n\nThere are many factors attributed to this low rate: high spending appetite among young Kenyans, high cost of living, especially in urban areas, and black tax. There\u2019s also a problem of cumbersome saving options and lack of proper financial education that exposes people to the importance of savings.\n\nThis is a big problem two pan-African tech operators Delila Kidanu and Alexis Roman are tackling through Koa, the digital saving platform they co-founded.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKoa founding story\n\nThe story of Koa can be traced back to MEST Africa as it\u2019s the first place the two co-founders met and worked. But the idea to start a company together hadn\u2019t been born yet. They were only heavily involved in MEST\u2019s mission, which is to incubate and help scale African entrepreneurs and startups, and were exposed to a lot of people and the process of building solutions for African problems.\n\nKidanu was born in Ethiopia, moved to Kenya as a child and lived there until she went to the UK to study international relations and business. She then moved to Sweden for a master\u2019s degree in innovation management and entrepreneurship. She proceeded to work with an NGO in Belgium to drive policies around global education before she moved back to Kenya to consult for international companies looking to set up shops in East Africa. After doing that for a while, she joined MEST Africa.\n\nRoman, on the other hand, was born in Paris but moved to Togo as a child where he stayed and schooled until he moved to Canada to study economics and finance. He started a business after school but later decided to go work in a traditional financial institution, which he called a mistake that came with lots of needed experience. He moved back to Africa to join MEST Africa in Ghana.\n\nAfter leaving MEST Africa, the duo forayed into different businesses but kept in touch and would always meet up whenever they were in the same city. Early 2020, they became colleagues again and started working as startup scouts for an early-fund venture capital, Microtraction.\n\nKoa co-founders\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Both Delila and I saw the popularity of digital saving products in Nigeria, like PiggyVest and Cowrywise, and how they were serving a real need for customers. But when we looked beyond Nigeria, as a market, we felt like there was a significant gap in other countries,\u201d Koa\u2019s CEO Roman told TechCabal.\n\nThey went ahead to speak to thousands of people in Kenya and discovered that 60% of the people relied on inefficient Informal Saving Groups and Cooperatives to save and access financial products. It became more obvious that lack of seamless saving option is another big factor aiding the problem. So they started deliberating about solving the problem the same way PiggyVest and Cowrywise are doing in Nigeria.\n\nIn December 2020, they finally founded Koa with Bubunyo Nyavor, their old colleague from MEST. The platform went into beta in April and was launched to the public in June.\n\nThe platform makes it easy for users to set personal saving goals towards a particular expenses like paying school fee, buying a new phones, cars or even marriage. The app nudge users\u2019 by sending them daily, weekly or monthly reminders to deposit into the goals they set. Koa also makes it easy for users to track their progress so that they won\u2019t slack or help them back on track when they do.\n\nKoa is playing in a tough market and so is investing heavily in educational content that exposes its users to the importance of savings, especially in creating generational wealth. So far, according to Kidanu, the platform has already passed a 12,000 users mark and has received a deposit of 11,105,315.30 KES ($100,000) since its launch.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company pitched at the TechCrunch battlefield as one of the only two African startups that made the cut and was the only African startup that made it to top-five. Both co-founders said it was a great learning curve for them and another validation that their product is essential in solving this real-life problem.\n\nIncentive: make more money while saving\n\nIt\u2019s not only difficult for Kenyans to save; the lack of access to formal financial products also made it hard to invest. So, Koa is killing two birds with one stone by holding its users\u2019 money in a money market through a partnership with Britam, an asset manager in the Kenyan market.\n\nOn Koa, users earn up to 10% interest on their money annually, depending on market conditions. They also earn interest daily, which is good because they see their money grow in real time. This strategy has helped to cement the gospel of building wealth through saving and passive investing.\n\n\u201cOur partner has different types of funds. For us, we needed to be able to tap into a lower risk investment so that we don\u2019t lose our customer base that is a bit more risk-averse. So we opted to work with Britam to invest in their money market fund,\u201d Kidanu said on why they choose such investment and the reality of their promised ROI.\n\nIn fintech, customer trust is key. Once you hack that, scaling becomes a lot less harder. It\u2019s evident in the way savings platforms like PiggyVest transparently communicate with their users and how much loyalty their users have for them. So are Koa users aware that their money is being invested in a money market?\n\n\u201cCustomer trust is very important to us, and we communicate with our customers in terms of where their money is, who our partner is, why we chose them, and how their fund flow works. We only make the investment passive because we want to ensure a seamless experience for our users who are new to this,\u201d Kidanu added.\n\nMaking money for a company whose major mission is to first help people who, before now, wouldn\u2019t even think of saving money and building wealth can be tricky because charging customers directly can end up driving them away. They don\u2019t think of the money they could make but the little that\u2019s being asked of them. So how does Koa make money as a business?\n\n\u201cWe make money when we get a commission from our asset management partner on funds invested. So we didn\u2019t want a situation where we\u2019d have to charge our customers directly for the service. We want them to enjoy the service for free,\u201d Roman said.\n\nThe founders said they\u2019ve raised a pre-seed institutional investment. On the back of the raised funds and their seed round, which closes soon, Kidanu and Roman also plan to scale fast and expand to neighbouring countries like Tanzania and Uganda that have the same saving problem.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Apple\u2019s second fall event, tagged \u201cApple Unleashed\u201d, happened on Monday October 18 and everybody and their uncles have been talking about the exciting series of updates released at the event.\n\nUnlike its September event that opened with drone-captured California landscapes in the company of live music, this recent event opened in a small garage with instrumental music, composed from a combination of simple sounds from the Mac, AirPods and HomePod.\n\nApple released two new Macbooks: the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) and MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021). The tech company went further to silence its critics with the two biggest surprises of the day: two new M1 chips\u2014the Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max\u2014which will power the new MacBooks and promise tremendous performance improvements over the silicon chips in previous MacBooks.\n\nIn a beautiful transition between Tim Cook and Zain Lowe, Apple also revealed the Music Voice Plan, a new subscription category for Apple Music that allows users to seamlessly use Siri with Apple Music.\n\nThe tech giant also introduced AirPods 3 and some new HomePod mini colours.\n\nAnd in a move that looks like a joke but isn\u2019t, Apple wants to sell its users a microfibre cleaning cloth for $19. But that\u2019s Apple doing what it does best.\n\nHere is a detailed list of everything that was announced.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nApple Music subscription plan\n\nApple is undoubtedly bullish on music and how its users experience sounds. The fall event started off with the introduction of Apple Music Voice Plan, a new subscription offering that allows users to seamlessly enjoy Siri with Apple Music.\n\nSiri will now have custom playlists dedicated to various moods and settings and featuring several notable artists. The new Voice Plan will allow subscribers to listen to their favourite music at an affordable price.\n\nThis feature will kick off in 17 countries before expanding to more regions. As you might have guessed, no African countries are included in the kick-off regions.\n\nThe new Voice Plan will begin at just $4.99 a month, which is way lesser than the individual and family plan that are $9.99 and $14.99 respectively.\n\nApple Music plans\n\nNew colours for Apple HomePod Mini Smart Speaker\n\nAesthetics\u2014that\u2019s the simplest way to describe this update. Even though Apple won\u2019t be giving us colour variations in Mac, as demanded by lots of users, it has added new colours to the HomePod. They are now available in orange, yellow and blue.\n\nApple HomePod\n\nAirPods 3\n\nAirpods 3 was one of the most anticipated products on the list, and it was launched with new features. It has the same design as the AirPods Pro and is loaded with spatial audio along with new low-distortion drivers, with sweat and water resistance.\n\nIt has a battery life of over six hours and arrives with MagSafe and wireless charging. The new AirPods selling price starts at $179 and will be available from next week.\n\nM1 Pro And M1 Max Chips\n\nEarlier in this article, we called these updates the two biggest surprises of the night. We didn\u2019t get just one horsepower processor; we got two. Apple is generous and we appreciate that.\n\nThese two processors are like the SSC Tuatara of computer chips; they are, by far, the strongest and fastest processors from Apple\u2014and from any company\u2014to date.\n\nThese two chips power the newly released Mac.\n\nNew 14\u2033 and 16\u2033 MacBook Pros\n\nMacBook Pro\n\nIn our review of iOS 15, we mentioned that Apple is listening to its users now more than ever. And that\u2019s evident in this new update. The new Apple Silicon-powered MacBook Pros, in 14\u2033 and 16\u2033 variations, have a lot of the things people want. Some things they want them to add and some they want them to bring back.\n\nThere are more ports (HDMI and SD card reader), MagSafe charging, real function keys and no-touch bar, along with what they promise is blistering speed with extreme energy efficiency.\n\nThe two devices come with a 1080p camera, studio-quality mics, more powerful sound system, and large beautiful Mini-LED displays. Some critics likened it to a notebook with a superman ability.\n\nThe price starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. The basic models come as standard with the M1 Pro, 16GB of Unified Memory and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch comes with the 10-core CPU instead of the 8-core in the 14-inch.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Apple intentionally released simple iPhone upgrades to lead their competitors on. Intel did their social experiment ads and capitalised on the inefficiency of Apple; then Microsoft had their event boasting about how they have built the best PC in Surface Studios, combining a cool form factor,\u201d Dumebi Iwuchukwu, design lead at Big Cabal Media, and of course an Apple fanboy, said in his unusual slack rants.\n\n\u201cNow Apple has blown them out of the water with better chips. The 64gb video memory is the most futuristic innovation from Apple so far; plus all these happened amidst a global chips shortage.\u201d he reluctantly concluded.\n\nThe prices of the two devices go up as their specs thicken. For instance, there\u2019s an addition of $500 on 14-inch for the M1 Max with 24-core GPU; 32-core GPU adds $700.

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nRisevest\u2019s unfrozen accounts\n\nVendease\u2019s seed round\n\nDigital address verification\n\nRisevest accounts unfrozen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has unfrozen the accounts of fintech startup, Risevest, giving them \u201cunfettered access\u201d to their accounts.\n\nJustice Taiwo O. Taiwo ruled that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) could not rely on a circular to freeze the accounts of a company trading in cryptocurrency via its bank accounts, adding that the CBN failed to prove that it was illegal to deal in cryptocurrency in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that on Tuesday, August 17, 2021, the CBN was granted an order by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja to freeze the accounts of Bamboo, Rise, Trove, and Chaka. The order was based on an allegation that these companies were operating without licenses as asset management companies.\n\nThe High Court\u2019s judgement offers some hope for startups operating in Nigeria, increasing the possibility that the courts could overturn arbitrary moves by regulatory bodies.\n\nVendease raises $3.2 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendease\u2019s founders. Source: Supplied\n\nVendease, a startup that helps food businesses get supplies directly from farms and manufacturers, has raised $3.2 million in a seed round.\n\nGlobal Founders Capital led the round with Hustle Fund, Hack VC, Soma Capital, Y Combinator, Liquid 2 Ventures, MAGIC Fund, Tayo Oviosu, Paga CEO, and John Obaro, Remita CEO joining the round.\n\nVendease plans to use the raise to expand into new locations before the end of Q1 2022. Currently, it operates in three Nigerian cities \u2014 Lagos, Ibadan, and Abuja. In addition to its expansion plans, the funds will help the startup build its technology and financial services offerings.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Tunde Kara, Olumide Fayankin, Gatumi Aliyu, and Wale Oyepeju, Vendease initially connected food businesses with suppliers.\n\nHowever, it soon discovered other challenges, including quality control issues and slow delivery times. As a result, the startup began building a comprehensive solution covering payments, logistics, storage, and inventory management.\n\nIn the last nine months, the startup says it has helped restaurants save approximately 5,000 man-hours while providing $3 million in financing for over 1,000 businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Don Stalter, Managing Partner of Global Founders Capital, said, \u201cAs a backer of one of Africa\u2019s very first unicorns, Jumia, we\u2019ve seen a great deal of talent in the market \u2014 and Tunde & the Vendease team are best in class both in EMEA and globally. Their laser focus and rapid growth are unprecedented, and there\u2019s a massive opportunity ahead.\u201d\n\nInterswitch partners with OkHi to digitally verify customers\u2019 addresses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a partnership between Interswitch and OkHi, customers of the former can now get a digital address that enables them to access faster loans and quick delivery services.\n\nOkHi is a smart addressing startup that makes it easy for companies to verify the identities of their customers through their smartphones.\n\nIn December 2020, after reportedly verifying over 300,000 addresses in Kenya, where the startup was founded, it pivoted into providing verification services for financial services businesses in Nigeria.\n\nPer TechCabal, the size of the market and the complexity of the Nigerian financial services industry was critical to the startup\u2019s decision. Incidentally, in 2020, it also raised $1.5 million in a round led by Interswitch, Founders Factory Africa, and Betatron venture capitalists.\n\nCommenting on the partnership, Tim Drayson, CEO and Founder of OkHi, said, \u201cAt OkHi, we have developed the first solution in the world that can collect an extremely accurate address through a smartphone and verify it through a smartphone. To have Interswitch launching us to millions of people via Quickteller gives us an incredible platform to tackle financial inclusion in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nVerifying the addresses provided by customers is a crucial activity in a business\u2019 onboarding process. However, most companies use utility bills and send human agents to confirm the addresses. This costs a lot of money and time. If a customer relocates, the address provided becomes obsolete.\n\nWith OkHi\u2019s solution, however, customer verification can now be done quickly using a smartphone. Through this partnership with Interswitch, OkHi is perfectly poised to serve other financial institutions in Nigeria, most of whom are served by Interswitch.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to retrain your frazzled brain and find your focus again.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter postponing the October 1, 2021 launch of the eNaira \u2014 Africa\u2019s first digital currency \u2014 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has announced in a press statement that the eNaira will launch today, Monday, October 25, 2021.\n\nAccording to the press statement, signed by Osita Nwanisobi, Director, Corporate Communications CBN, the eNaira will be unveiled formally by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.\n\nIt adds that the launch marks the first step of the eNaira journey. It will continue with a series of \u201cfurther modifications, capabilities and enhancements to the platforms.\u201d\n\nThe CBN has also released a design paper that reiterates the importance of the eNaira and gives a bit more information about the design, benefits, and how the currency will work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenefits, risks, and features of the eNaira.\n\nAccording to the design paper, one of the benefits of the eNaira is the possibility of direct welfare disbursement to citizens.\n\nIt says the COVID-19 pandemic has pointed out the lapses in the distribution of welfare incentives, and the eNaira will provide \u201ca clear means for the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programs.\u201d\n\nIt also highlights cross-border transactions as a benefit, saying the eNaira \u201cgives Nigeria the ability to transact separately, thereby reducing the demand for correspondent banking services and SWIFT international financial messaging and payment systems for the clearing and settlement of trade.\u201d\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT, is a payment network that receives and sends electronic payments internationally.\n\nSWIFT transactions are expensive and take between one and four days to complete. The design paper says that the eNaira will speed up cross-border payments but doesn\u2019t state how fast it will be.\n\nThis will be possible because of the eNaira\u2019s interoperability, one of the design elements mentioned in the design paper. This means it can work with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) from other countries, making it useful outside the country and enabling easy cross-border payments.\n\nHowever, only five countries \u2014 The Bahamas, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Grenada \u2014 have fully launched a CBDC according to Atlantic Council\u2019s CBDC tracker.\n\nIn terms of data and privacy protection, the paper says users can determine how their data is used and shared. However, the currency is designed according to Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) guidelines. This means data rights might not apply all the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent article, we explored how private or permissioned blockchains, such as the Hyperledger Fabric being used by the CBN, work and the amount of control it gives it. We pointed out that it provides total and direct control over the eNaira.\n\nInterestingly, the CBN highlights the risks associated with using the eNaira, admitting that the complexity of the new system could lead to further financial exclusion.\n\nIn response, the CBN designed the eNaira to work on mobile phones that are not Internet-enabled. It will also put in place sensitisation campaigns to acquaint users with the eNaira.\n\nThe apex bank also admits that the effect this new financial system will have on existing systems is unknown. It will address the risk by putting in place a governance structure that will \u201ccontinuously evaluate the risk and exposures of the eNaira to the current payment system.\u201d\n\nThe CBN expressed cybersecurity concerns about the eNaira, noting that while blockchain technology might be considered somewhat unhackable, there have been cases of hacks.\n\nOne such case was the $150 million hack of crypto exchange KuCoin in September 2020. However, such hacks make the dangers of centralisation in the blockchain space glaring.\n\nAccording to CDOTrends, Dyma Budorin, CEO of Hacken Group, a blockchain cybersecurity firm, suggests that the hack could have been a social engineering attack on employees of the exchange with access to the private keys.\n\nThe eNaira runs on a private blockchain and is, thus, centralised. This means that if vital information were to leak, the entire eNaira architecture could be compromised.\n\nHowever, the CBN says IT security assessment will be conducted regularly to secure the eNaira infrastructure from any vulnerabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the eNaira website indicates that the speed wallet app that will facilitate eNaira transactions is available for download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has expressed optimism that the adoption of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its underlying blockchain technology, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by $29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nBuhari who officially launched e-Naira at the presidential villa, Abuja on Monday, affirmed that the introduction of the e-Naira would enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes as well as foster cross border trade.\n\nThe President, according to a statement from his media aide, Femi Adesina, said that alongside digital innovations, CBDCs can foster economic growth through better economic activities, increase remittances, improve financial inclusion and make monetary policy more effective.\n\n\u201cLet me note that aside from the global trend to create Digital Currencies, we believe that there are Nigeria-specific benefits that cut across different sectors of, and concerns of the economy,\u201d the statement quoted the president as saying.\n\n\u201cThe use of CBDCs can help move many more people and businesses from the informal into the formal sector, thereby increasing the tax base of the country.\u201d\n\nThe President said with the launch of e-Naira, Nigeria has become the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world to introduce a digital currency to her citizens.\n\nHe commended the Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele, his deputies and the entire team of staff who worked tirelessly to make the launch of Africa\u2019s first digital currency a reality.\n\nPresident Buhari, who assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC system, said the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began sometime in 2017.\n\n\u201cWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System, \u201d he said.\n\nWhile explaining how he approved the use of digital currency, President Buhari stated: \u201dIn recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline. This trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new Digital Economy.\n\n\u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that Central Banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u201cprivate currencies\u201d that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of Central Banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments.\n\n\u201cA handful of countries including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia have already issued their own CBDCs.\n\n\u201cA 2021 survey of Central Banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 percent were experimenting with the technology and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of e-Naira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the e-Naira,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President was of the view that his approval was also underpinned by the fact that the CBN has been a leading innovator \u2018\u2018in the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s apex bank has invested heavily in creating a Payment System that is ranked in the top ten in the world and certainly the best in Africa.\n\n\u201cThis payment system now provides high\u2010value and time\u2010critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey have also supported several private\u2010sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the CBN Governor explained that e-Naira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira.\n\n\u201cAs the tagline simply encapsulates, the e-Naira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The e-Naira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The e-Naira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 naira to 1 e-Naira,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele added that the CBN has given careful consideration to the entire payments and financial architecture and has designed the e-Naira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems and has implemented secure safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe apex bank\u2019s boss pledged that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, since the eNaira platform went live, there has been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and other parties across the world with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nWhile listing the milestones, Emefiele stated: \u201d33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform, 500 million has been successfully minted by the Bank, N200 million has been issued to financial institutions, over 2,000 customers have been onboarded and over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the e-Naira platform.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor also used the occasion to commend President Buhari for making history, yet again, with the launch of the e-Naira \u2013 the first in Africa and one of the earliest around the world.\n\nHe also dispelled fears on the nation\u2019s foreign reserves, saying the reserves are strong and getting stronger by the day.\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cMr President, as you make groundbreaking reforms, there has been continuing debate on the true value of the Naira. Rather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyze how we got here in the first place.\n\n\u201cPlease recall that since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market, the Naira has been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\n\u201cSome 35 years later, we have not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\n\u201cInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which has wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our Cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\n\n\u201cUnder your leadership, Mr President, we must stop this decline for good! We must return to massive homemade production; we must get our people working again. We must create an economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\n\n\u201cAs custodians of your national reserves, let me first assure you that there is no cause for alarm. Our FX reserves are strong and indeed getting stronger by the day, crossing the 40 billion USD mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot fritter our reserves away on cheap imports and currency speculators. We must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\u201cIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery, we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly.\u201d\n\nIn addition to all policies and actions of the CBN to support the economy especially through the trying times of COVID-19, Emefiele announced a new financial instrument titled \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d, which will be anchored in the Development Finance Department under his direct supervision.\n\nHe explained that under this policy the CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinize and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from 01 November 2021, and rolling over every 100 days with new set of 100 companies, whose names will be published in National Dailies for Nigerians to verify and confirm.",

But the good news is, our nation has the capacity and potential to surmount all these challenges which are not peculiar to our nation, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe, the members of National Interest Forum today call on all Nigerians, irrespective of creed, tribe or tongue to come out and join this movement in order to bring Nigerians together to have a united front determined to put our nation first, before self, tribe or religion, in everything we do.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call on all political parties and leaders, religious and traditional rulers, professional bodies to join in this movement so that we can begin to re-orientate our people as we put our nation first.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days and weeks, we will be engaging our people through town hall meetings in all the states of the federation in order to be sensitised on the need for everyone to put our nation first in all our dealings. We are glad to declare today, this hashtag #OurNation First. And we are optimistic that Nigeria will regain and remain the giant of Africa that it has been. God bless our nation, Nigeria.\u201d",
          "summary": "It is only by making the interest of the nation a major priority that Nigerians can achieve its lost glory and as well attain its God-given potentials.\nThis remark was the position of a newly formed group under the auspicies of National Interest Forum (NIF), at a press conference held on Monday.\n\u201cAs patriots, the National Interest Forum sees the need to close the big gap in our nation today which came about as a result of lack of trust, lack of unity, misunderstanding, personal and sectional interests among others.\nBut the good news is, our nation has the capacity and potential to surmount all these challenges which are not peculiar to our nation, Nigeria.\nGod bless our nation, Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The director general, Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Prof. Mansur Matazu, yesterday said dwindling aviation revenue due to Covid-19 pandemic is threatening safety and security in the sector.\n\nMatazu said this at the 2021 Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Airport Council International-Africa (ACI-Africa), Safety Week.\n\nThe NiMET boss, however, lamented that despite recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, the aviation sector was still battling with dwindling revenue.\n\nAccording to him, every effort to promote safety and security by any government must be encouraged saying government cannot do it alone as every industry player must come together to actualise security and safety as a culture in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)\u2019s visit.\n\nHe said: \u201cDespite the current recovery being recorded in the industry around the world, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still clearly visible with us. With dwindling revenue, funds to sustain security and safety are also limited. Hence, every effort to promote safety and security by any government must be encouraged.\n\n\u201cHowever, government alone cannot do this, every industry player must come together to actualise security and safety as a culture in line with the vision of ICAO. While we all work hard to build security and safety culture at our airports, we must not lose sight of safety at take-off, airborne and landing. This is largely dependent on the prevailing weather conditions at the airports and en route.\u201d\n\nMatazu, however, urged all stakeholders in the nation\u2019s aviation sector to support government\u2019s effort in ensuring security and safety at the airports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis words, \u201cFrom the beginning to the end of every flight journey, weather events are critical. Hence, the importance of availability of adequate information regarding current and predicted weather cannot be overemphasised. NiMet is well committed to improving infrastructure and equipment for weather observation and forecasting.\n\n\u201cIn a move to ensure that the giant steps taken and the gains made by the agency in the aviation sector in recent years are not eroded, on my assumption of office earlier this year, the management of NiMet constituted an Aviation Task Team.\n\n\u201cThe work of the team is to assess and evaluate the state of our equipment and infrastructure including human resource, across all the airports in the country, and make recommendations where necessary, for improved safety and service delivery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Team has so far assessed the nation\u2019s Airports at Abuja, Kaduna, Lagos, Katsina, Kano, Port Harcourt and Calabar Airports. Assessments of other airports have also been scheduled to commence soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry continues to operate at the forefront. The situation is no different in Nigeria where the federal government of Nigeria, through the federal ministry of aviation, continues to invest in the sector to ensure that our nation\u2019s aviation is safe and secure for stakeholders and passengers.\u201d",

Our problem is farmers and herders clashes and kidnapping for ransom. We have drug abuse and agitation for self determination.\n\n\u201cWe have always preached the multi-level policing in Ondo State. We believe in layers of security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, who explained that though there were criminal trespasses which could be treated by the state, alleged that before the Amotekun corps was established, the police were not always ready to make arrest.\n\n\u201cYes, you have criminal trespass. It should be treated by the state. All we had before Amotekun was a police that had the duty to arrest and was not prepared to make an arrest.\n\n\u201cThings are changing and have really changed in Ondo state. Today, if you trespass on other people\u2019s land, the Amotekun will go after you and arrest you.\n\n\u201cThey pay compensations to the farmers and when they fail they are in court. It is the only way you can send signals to the people.\n\n\u201cWhen you commit a crime and the hands of law doesn\u2019t catch up with you, another person will repeat it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn open grazing, Akeredolu said nomadic pastoralist was a culture that must be discouraged in the interest of those involved.\n\nHe noted that the issue of grazing routes was not a welcome conversation, adding that those were issues of the past that must not be brought back to the fore.\n\n\u201cSpeaking for those of us who have put in place anti-open grazing law. We have our reasons and we have no apologies,\u201d he said.",

Rather than appreciate this honest gesture, he molested, abused and dehumanized the Cluster Director of Human Resources, the leader of the delegation, slapped him on his chest and pushed him out of his door to the amazement of others.\n\n\u201cAs if this was not enough, the following day Monday 4th of October, 2021 he sadly brought back the cake to the management team meeting. A blatant rejection of the goodwill of the entire workers. An action the entire workers considered a slight.\n\n\u201cA room, long allocated to the Director of Security before his deployment to the hotel, meant to ensure response to emergencies should the need arise, Mr Rex turned the room to his bicycles parking lot while the man was still occupying the room before being finally ejected, while millions of naira was spent purchasing brand new items for his own apartment in the hotel.\u201d\n\nThey also alleged that the General Manager has since begun the conversion of the entire workforce to casuals and contract staff renewable every two years, thereby creating a workforce that are not only dissatisfied but gradually depicting this in their quality of service.\n\nEqually, the union accused him of giving the status of permanent staff to people he employed, while some casuals who have spent 10 years as casuals, are yet to be made staff.\n\nAccording to the letter: \u201cMr. Rex has created a serious unease in the minds of the workforce because if the cluster Director of Human resources can be dehumanized this way, it suggest that no one is safe. A very dangerous precedence has been created by Mr. Rex Nijof.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the light of this very unfortunate situation, we demand for the resignation of Mr Rex with immediate effect to save the hotel from the pending shame and ridicule his actions are bringing to the hotel and the entire workforce.\u201d",

          "text": "Following the debut of the much-anticipated digital currency, e-Naira, which is Africa\u2019s first of its kind, a social justice expert has expressed worry.\n\nOn Monday, President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the e-Naira at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari previously stated that the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its underlying technology, blockchain, had the potential to boost Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $29 billion over the next ten years.\n\nAccording to Buhari, the e-Naira will allow the government to transmit direct payments to residents who are eligible for specific welfare programs and promote cross-border trade.\n\nThe digital currency has the potential to boost economic growth through increasing economic activity, remittances, financial inclusion, and monetary policy effectiveness.\n\nHowever, Eze Onyekpere, the Lead Director of the Centre for Social Justice, CSJ, criticized the debut of e-Naira.\n\nOnyekpere complained to DAILY POST that the newly introduced e-Naira offers \u201cno remarkable value\u201d to the economy.\n\nThe CSJ Lead Director characterized the government\u2019s recent step as \u201ccosmetic,\u201d and wondered what value the digital currency would add to the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think the important thing right now is what adds value to the economy in terms of job creation, stabilizing our currency, economic growth, and reducing the run on the Naira.\n\n\u201cSo all these, be it e-money or x-money, is not adding any spectacular value; it\u2019s just a different format of the money available.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not about having the capacity or not, of course we have it; but it\u2019s a little bit cosmetic; what value is it adding to the economy?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m yet to see any major value, is it going to create jobs for the teeming youths? Is it going to return the value of the Naira? Is it going to reduce inflation? Or it\u2019s just one of those formal things that doesn\u2019t hold the substance of the challenge of the Nigerian economy?\u201d\n\nDAILY POST observed that one of the major threats to the digital currency is fraud, and the Nigerian government launched the e-Naira at a time when the country is witnessing an escalation in advanced fee fraud popularly called Yahoo Yahoo.\n\nSome Nigerian youths have taken to Yahoo Yahoo as a shorter route to economic empowerment, which is a direct result of the government\u2019s inadequacies to provide jobs and ensure improvement in the quality of lives.\n\nRecall that a Nigerian Instagram celebrity, Ramon Abbas aka Hushpuppi and his cronies had used financial platforms like Bitcoin to hide some of the loots they acquired from Yahoo Yahoo.\n\nHowever, Onyekpere urged the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, and security agents to be proactive in protecting the digital currency from fraudsters.\n\nHe said: \u201cEverything that has an advantage must have a disadvantage. E-money does not necessarily means fraud, and as some people are planning it; there should be security measures to put in place by CBN, security agencies, and financial intelligent unit, who should work towards curtailing such, that is why we pay them.\n\n\u201cThat people can commit fraud should not be a reason why we should not operate e-money. I think we should work towards curtailing any negative tendencies.\u201d\n\nEze Onyekpere is a lawyer with specialization in development law including electricity reforms, fiscal governance, human rights and constitutional reforms. He has worked on electric power sector reforms, privatization, gender and trade policy and liberalization of education.",

          "title": "Sheikh Gumi to Yoruba, Igbo clerics: Talk to IPOB, Igboho as I talk to bandits",
          "text": "Kaduna-based popular Muslim cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi has asked clerics of Igbo and Yoruba extractions to broker truce with members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, as he did with bandits terrorising the North-West and parts of the North-Central.\n\nThe controversial cleric, had at different times mediated between the bandits and some state governments, a development condemned in some quarters.\n\nThe mission took him to Kaduna, Niger, Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara where he attempted to broker peace between the governors and the outlaws.\n\nHowever, he could not arrange such peace deal between Kaduna state government and the bandits as the government warned anybody against doing such on its behalf.\n\nThe cleric, who had some time called for amnesty for the bandits, was also reported to have said bandits cannot be declared terrorists.\n\nAnd in a statement Monday posted on his Facebook and obtained by Blueprint in Abuja, the controversial cleric said: \u201cNE is already and is still devastated by this madness for over 12 years. If we allow, terror, to set into these raw na\u00efve unexposed bandits, NW will be in ruins sooner than later. Already IPOB is destroying SE, and Igboho has set the ball of confusion rolling in SW. For those who want to destroy the NW, it\u2019s a good recipe. Turn bandits into religious zealots. Tell me, what then remains of Nigeria?\n\n\u201cI have started to get these raw bandits out of their misadventure, but unfortunately, I have few helpers and a mountain of antagonists. The psychology in fighting natives is to induce a motive for their struggle if they don\u2019t have one already, a motive that is manageable, and it is so managed. Unfortunately, reactions to threat in our nation are always slow and incoherent.\n\n\u201cI hope another Igbo clergy goes into the IPOB militants likewise and talk sense into them, and another Pastor of Oduduwa land talks against the Igboho secessionist tribal movement by way of sensitising people to the values of a cohesive nationalism that will guaranty freedom, equality, and justice for all. Religious forces can permeate hardened hearts where secular forces cannot.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, people just sit down in the comfort of their rooms or parlours and make useless passing comments that only add fuel to the inferno of ethnic jingoism and bigotry. In the 21st century, Nigeria is hijacked by semi-illiterates and half-baked tribal heroes that have nothing to offer besides promoting tribal xenophobia.\n\n\u201cNigeria has over 250 ethnic groupings, it is not possible to divide such a nation into tribal enclaves. Nigeria is multi-religious, even with one same religion or sect there is no harmony and understanding that can build a prosperous unified nation where tranquility and development will flourish. We are tired of these bogus destructive fruitless slogans!\u201d\n\nLabeling bandits terrorists\n\nOn the calls by Governors Nasir El-rufai and Aminu Bello Masari that the bandits be declared terrorists, Guma said such a move would have some dire consequences.\n\nThe ex-soldier cum medical doctor made the position known on his Facebook.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeclaring Bandits as Terrorists: will come with a prize! Nobody doubts that sentimentalism today overrides sensibility in our polity. For the sake of posterity, some people will have to speak out.\n\n\u201cThe acts the bandits are committing now in NW have gradually over time become tantamount to terrorism because wherever innocent people are fatal victims it is pure terrorism. Yet, innocence these days is relative. We agreed if their children and women are also killed, they are guilty by association or collateral damage, so also the bandits may think the same way. It\u2019s right for vigilantes to lynch Fulanis herdsmen or anyone that looks like them by profiling but wrong for the herdsmen to ransack villages in retribution. They are pushed to believe it is an existential war and in war, ethics are thrown to the winds.\n\n\u201cYet again, the only helpful part that is against bandits is that no other than them are attracted to join them in the NW because of its ethnic tinge and coloration. However, the moment they are termed Terrorist \u2013 Islamic for that matter, the direct foreign Jihadist movements will set in in force. And many teaming unemployed youth may find it palatable and attractive. Shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 plus AK47 against a \u2018secular\u2019 immoral society, where impunity reigns are the magnet for extremists and downtrodden \u2013 the majority of our youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready these deadly terrorist groups are fighting for the soul of these bandits. This will give criminality a spiritual cover and remove the stigma of discrediting them with such crimes since now they are fighting a \u2018Jihad\u2019 as they will claim. In such a situation, does the larger society -as it is- has the moral high ground to fight back? This is the most probable consequence, the price of which is not worth it. Nothing stops the kinetic actions from going on without the controversy of semantics,\u201d the cleric further added.\n\nOmokri slams Gumi\n\nReacting to the call, Reno Omkri, a former media aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has condemned Gumi, asking him to stop doing \u2018PR\u2019 for the bandits.\n\nIn a Twitter post Monday, Omokri hit the federal government for going after bandits, while turning a blind eye to \u2018an inspiration to terrorists.\u2019\n\n\u201cSheikh Gumi never speaks for the victims. But when terrorists bandits are affected, he speaks. How long shall a government that is after Igboho and Kanu continue tolerating the PR work Gumi is doing for terrorists bandits? Gumi is an inspiration to these terrorists,\u201d Omokri wrote.\n\nAkeredolu\n\nIn a related development, Ondo state Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN) has warned that the various criminal activities of kidnapping, bombing and assault on the people in some parts of the country being referred to as banditry must be appropriately addressed as terrorism.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu said infiltration of the country\u2019s borders and burning down of railway were activities that must be addressed as terrorism and the perpetrators treated as same.\n\nThe governor spoke Monday in Abuja at the 27th Nigerian Economic Summit with the theme: \u201cSecuring Our Future: The Fierce Urgency of Now.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu and his Kaduna state counterpart, Mallam El-rufai and others were among the panelists at the summit which centered on addressing the security challenges in the country.\n\nIn his introductory remarks, Akeredolu contended that a nation with failed security and justice systems was set to fail.\n\nWhile lamenting that the dimension of insecurity in the country recently was surprising, the governor said he had always believed in multi-level policing as the best way of securing the nation.\n\n\u201cIn Ondo State, we don\u2019t have terrorism. Our problem is farmer/herder clashes and kidnap for ransom. We have drug abuse and agitation for self-determination. We have always preached the multi-level policing in Ondo state. We believe in layers of security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, who explained that although there were criminal trespasses which can be treated by the state, stressed that before the Amotekun corps was established, the Police were not always ready to make arrest.\n\n\u201cYes, you have criminal trespass. It should be treated by the state. All we had before Amotekun was a police that had the duty to arrest and was not prepared to make an arrest. Things are changing and have really changed in Ondo state.\n\n\u201cToday, if you trespass on other people\u2019s land, the Amotekun will go after you and arrest you. They pay compensations to the farmers and when they fail they are in court. It is the only way you can send signals to the people.\n\n\u201cWhen you commit a crime and the hands of law doesn\u2019t catch up with you, another person will repeat it. I can assure you that when you do not have an effective policing system, there is little or nothing a governor can do. And the criminal trial is taking too long,\u201d the governor further said.\n\nSpeaking on the recent ban on open grazing, Governor Akeredolu said the culture of nomadic pastoralist must be discouraged in the interest of those involved.\n\nHe noted that the issue of grazing routes was not a welcome conversation, adding that those were issues of the past that must not be brought back to the fore.\n\n\u201dSpeaking for those of us who have put in place anti-open grazing law. We have our reasons and we have no apologies. Grazing routes? Grazing routes to where? It is not going to work. There are things we had in the past. Don\u2019t let us imagine it now. Time changes. Grazing with AK 47 is an assault. Ban on open grazing, we are doing it effectively in Ondo state.\n\n\u201cNomadic pastoralist is not a new thing. There were nomadic farmers all over the world. I know of people, high ranking who have ranches today. They can showcase their cows.\n\n\u201cWhy are we pushing these people out? It is a culture that must be discouraged in the interest of those who are involved. Even with the president\u2019s order that anyone with AK-47 should be arrested, how many have been arrested?\u201d the governor said.",

I am ready for a showdown.\u201d\n\nHe was also overheard claiming to have knowledge of some of the ex-governor\u2019s companies in Lagos, allegedly established with proceeds from the state.\n\nAudu further accused the former governor of not supporting the opposition People Democratic Party(PDP) in the state, describing the action as being counterproductive to the party\u2019s interest.\n\nThe clips also revealed the duo as expressing angst over what they called the overbearing influence of the PDP chairman in the state, Mallam Salisu Majigiri.\n\nThey accused Majigiri, who, as chief of staff to Shema, of blocking members\u2019 access to the former governor, warning such an action cold only drive away loyal party members.\n\nThe general feeling among indigenes of the state is that it has become imperative for the EFCC and other anti-graft agencies to step up their investigation into the allegations against the governor and even some of his cronies, including his governors.\n\n\u201cClearly, this revelation, coming from people who served with him and who in law, are accomplices, showed that the state\u2019s resources may have been mismanaged.

          "text": "The adoption of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its underlying technology, called block chain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) by $29 billion over the next 10 years, President Muhammadu Buhari has said.\n\nThe president said Monday at the official launch of the eNaira in Abuja.\n\nHe also declared that the introduction of the eNaira would enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes as well as foster cross border trade.\n\nBuhari said alongside digital innovations, CBDCs can foster economic growth through better economic activities, increase remittances, improve financial inclusion and make monetary policy more effective.\n\n\u201dLet me note that aside from the global trend to create Digital Currencies, we believe that there are Nigeria-specific benefits that cut across different sectors of, and concerns of the economy.\n\n\u201dThe use of CBDCs can help move many more people and businesses from the informal into the formal sector, thereby increasing the tax base of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said with the launch of eNaira, Nigeria has become the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world to introduce a Digital Currency to her citizens.\n\nHe commended Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) Godwin Emefiele, his deputies and the entire team of staff who worked tirelessly to make the launch of Africa\u2019s first digital currency a reality.\n\nThe president, who assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC system, said the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began sometime in 2017.\n\n\u201dWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also explained to Nigerians why he approved the use of the digital currency.\n\n\u201dIn recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline. This trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new Digital Economy.\n\n\u201dAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201dThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that Central Banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u201cprivate currencies\u201d that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of Central Banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments.\n\n\u201dA handful of countries including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia have already issued their own CBDCs. A 2021 survey of Central Banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 percent were experimenting with the technology and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201dNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201dIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said his approval was also underpinned by the fact that the CBN had been a leading innovator \u2018\u2018in the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s apex bank has invested heavily in creating a Payment System ranked in the top ten in the world and certainly the best in Africa.\n\n\u201dThis payment system now provides high\u2010value and time\u2010critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dThey have also supported several private\u2010sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks, CBN Governor Emefiele explained that eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira.\n\n\u201dAs the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The eNaira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 naira to 1 eNaira,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the CBN had given careful consideration to the entire payments and financial architecture and has designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems and has implemented secure safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nEmefiele pledged that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nAccording to him, since the eNaira platform went live, there has been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and other parties across the world with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nHe listed the following milestones: \u201c33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform, 500 million has been successfully minted by the Bank, N200 million has been issued to financial institutions, over 2,000 customers have been onboarded and over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the eNaira platform.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor also used the occasion to commend President Buhari for making history, yet again, with the launch of the eNaira \u2013 the first in Africa and one of the earliest around the world.\n\nHe also dispelled fears on the nation\u2019s foreign reserves, saying the reserves are strong and getting stronger by the day.\n\n\u201dMr. President, as you make ground breaking reforms, there have been continuing debate on the true value of the Naira. Rather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyze how we got here in the first place.\n\n\u201dPlease recall that since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market, the Naira has been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\n\u201dSome 35 years later, we have not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\n\u201dInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which has wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process.\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our Cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\n\n\u201dUnder your leadership, Mr. President, we must stop this decline for good! We must return to massive homemade production; we must get our people working again. We must create the economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\n\n\u201dAs custodians of your national reserves, let me first assure you that there is no cause for alarm. Our FX reserves are strong and indeed getting stronger by the day, crossing the 40 billion USD mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing.\n\n\u201dBut we cannot fritter our reserves away on cheap imports and currency speculators. We must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\u201dIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery, we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7",

          "text": "The Federal Government has asked the Court of Appeal in Abuja, to order a fresh trial in an alleged N7.1billion laundering charge against the former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\nThe government is asking the appellate court to set aside the September 29 judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which prohibited it from retrying the former governor and his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited.\n\nREAD ALSO: Alleged N780m Fraud: EFCC Grills Former Senate President Anyim\n\nThe Federal Government, through the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), also wants the Appeal Court to order Senator Kalu and his company, to submit themselves for retrial, in line with the order of the Supreme Court in its May 8, 2020 judgement, voiding the earlier trial and conviction of Kalu and two others, and ordering a retrial.\n\nThe requests were contained in two notices of appeal, filed by a lawyer to the EFCC, Rotimi Jacobs, against the two judgements delivered by Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nProhibition To Try\n\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja had earlier in September barred the Federal Government from retrying the former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, on the N7.1billion money laundering charge which the EFCC earlier preferred against him.\n\nIn a judgement delivered by Justice Inyang Ekwo, the court held that the Supreme Court did not in the verdict it gave on May 8, 2020, order the retrial of either Kalu or his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited.\n\nJustice Ekwo held that the Supreme Court only ordered the retrial of former Director of Finance in Abia State, Jones Udeogu, who was the appellant before it.\n\nIn reaction, the EFCC said it will appeal this judgement.\n\nKalu was serving a 12-year jail term for N7.1 billion fraud when the Supreme Court, ruling on an appeal by his co-defendant, Ude Udeogu, on May 8, 2020, nullified the proceedings leading to their conviction.\n\nThe Supreme Court had ordered a retrial at the Federal High Court.\n\nBut Kalu who profited from the ruling to secure release from the Kuje Correctional Centre filed an application before the Federal High Court in Abuja to stop his retrial.\n\nEarlier today, Justice Ekwo had granted the ex-governor\u2019s request on the grounds that the apex court\u2019s judgment did not order his retrial and that by virtue of Section 36 (9) of the 1999 constitution as amended, or Section 283 (2) of the ACJA (Administration of Criminal Justice Act), \u201cno person can be retried on the offence upon which he has been convicted\u201d.\n\nThe EFCC in a statement by its Head of Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, however, believes the judge erred in this ruling as it says Section 36(9) of the 1999 Constitution is applicable only where the previous judgment was by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nIn this case, the apex court had in the said judgment, described the process that led to the conviction of Kalu as a nullity because the judge came from the Court of Appeal to decide the matter.\n\nThe Commission further averred that the court erred in its ruling that the Supreme Court did not order the retrial of Kalu; that it amounts to cherry-picking for Kalu to profit from the decision of the apex court nullifying the conviction of his co-defendant, Ude Udeagu but is not prepared to face the burden of retrial.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari launched Nigeria\u2019s digital currency at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Monday.\n\nThe digital currency was billed to be unveiled on October 1 but was shifted due to other activities slated for the Independence Day celebration.\n\nIn announcing the launch of the e-Naira, the CBN stated that the product, which was put together following many years of research, will advance the boundaries of payments system in order to make financial transactions easier.\n\nREAD ALSO: eNaira Will Increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP By $29bn, Says Buhari\n\nThe apex bank further said that the launch of the digital currency is a major step forward in the evolution of money and vowed to ensure that the e-Naira, like the physical Naira, is accessible by everyone.\n\nHere are six things we all need to know about the e-Naira:\n\nBeyond CBDC\n\nAccording to the CBN, the e-Naira is not just another CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency); the platform is said to be a people-oriented digital currency leveraging technology to connect individuals and businesses for easy trading and financial inclusion. The apex bank said it pushed the boundaries, bridged gaps, and told actual humane stories in the process of making the platform. \u201cWe are the foremost audience-centric digital currency brandishing a face,\u201d the CBN noted on the e-Naira official website.\n\nBuilt with current realities\n\nIn further explaining how the e-Naira was built, the CBN notes that from conception, the e-Naira has followed a careful thought and implementation process, beginning with understanding current realities in Nigeria\u2019s evolving payment landscape, working with clear objectives and principles built from those realities, meticulously laying out the aspects of the architecture and infrastructure and keeping note of real-time risk management protocols.\n\n\ufeff\n\nIssues regarding cashless policy, National Financial Inclusion strategy, Bank Verification number, Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility, License categorization for the Payment System and Establishment of NIBSS Payment Infrastructure, were all put into consideration.\n\nGeneral benefits\n\nThe e-Naira is expected to foster economic growth by offering easier access to capital and financial services which will increase economic activities at low/no interest transaction rate.\n\nIt is also expected to provide secure and cheaper diaspora remittance option and make such transactions faster.\n\nDue to its traceability, the e-Naira makes it more difficult for individuals or organizations to indulge in fraud.\n\nWhile the impossibility of being forged, makes it very strong and reliable, the e-Naira provides financial inclusion by making financial services available to communities without enough banking opportunities.\n\nLocal and international trade are expected to be increased with the emergence of the e-Naira, and the nation\u2019s digital currency is expected to aid revenue collection by reducing the cost of handling cash.\n\nExceptional digital experience\n\nWith the e-Naira, diaspora payments are expected to become cheaper and safer as to ensure individuals get more value for every Naira they earn. As regards local payments, people can boycott the queues and pay taxes, and bills from the comfort of their home in an easier and dependable fashion.\n\nAlso with the e-Naira, the CBN assures that financial government aids will get straight to the people, as it knocks the middle men out the way and individuals can claim funds directly.\n\nAn extra benefit attached is the secure banking which the e-Naira promises.\n\nThose worried about the safety and security of banking details can be rest assured that the transparency makes everything traceable.\n\nBeyond faster and better transactions, the CBN promises that the eNaira makes it possible to send funds, save money, and save time while at it.\n\nMore for Individuals, Businesses\n\nGoing through the features, one notices that there are specific solutions that are all-encompassing for individuals and organizations. It offers local and international Non-Governmental Organizations and Religious Institutions money transaction solutions that ensures that, at the end of the day, their focus is trained more on carrying out their projects than on the security and usage of the money backing each project.\n\nWhile everyone can donate every time, the e-Naira is expected to make expense-tracking and report-development for social projects for NGOs, nearly automated. This is as the traceability of each eNaira ensures that balancing ledgers and knowing the exact identity of the recipient of each eNaira occurs at near-real time and in tandem with the very transfer of funds itself.\n\nFor business owners, eNaira payment options are expected to help keep customers coming back as they pay for services with such ease. Also with eNaira, the customer base spreads beyond the shores of Nigeria because overseas payment is not just possible but fast and even cheap. According to the CBN, \u201cthe more the patronage, the more profit!\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, eNaira makes it easier for business owners to get support allowance from the government because the CBN has their wallet information and can make direct deposits on behalf of the government.\n\nGovernment is also expected to experience an increase in revenue and this according to the apex bank is due to the fact that through reduction in cash handling costs and more transparent taxing systems, eNaira makes more funds available for development projects such as better feeder roads, affordable education, and more equipped health facilities.\n\nIt is projected that spending eNaira will make for a richer Government and a richer people.\n\nUnified Payment System\n\nCustomers can move money from their bank account to their eNaira wallet with ease. They can also make in-store payment using their eNaira wallet by scanning QR codes.\n\nIndividuals can monitor their eNaira wallet, check balances and view transaction history with ease and the platform allows users to send money to one another through a linked bank account or card.\n\nThe cost for sending and receiving money faster, easily, will come at a very minimal costs, the CBN promises. There is always a transaction history and as such, customers can verify their payments anytime and anywhere.\n\nOn the eNaira official pages, the CBN stated that intra/inter financial institutions transactions are not only possible, they are faster and cheaper. In addition to this, customers can enjoy speedy transactions across boundaries and a hitch-free foreign exchange.\n\nIn conclusion, the eNaira serves as both a medium of exchange and a store of value, offering \u201cbetter payment prospects in retail transactions when compared to cash payments\u201d. It also has an exclusive operational structure that is \u201cboth remarkable and nothing like other forms of central bank money,\u201d CBN notes in its official page.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the objective is to see eNaira enable households and businesses to make fast, efficient, and reliable payments, while benefiting from a resilient, innovative, inclusive, and competitive payment system.",

          "text": "Japan\u2019s Princess Mako married her university sweetheart on Tuesday, but it was a low-key union bereft of traditional rituals, with the couple voicing sadness over the controversy that haunted their engagement.\n\nUnder the rules of the imperial family, Emperor Naruhito\u2019s 30-year-old niece Mako gave up her royal title as she wed Kei Komuro, who is the same age and works for a US law firm.\n\n\u201cTo me, Kei is irreplaceable. Our marriage is a necessary step for us to be able to protect our hearts,\u201d she told reporters after the marriage was registered.\n\n\u201cI have been scared, feeling sadness and pain whenever one-sided rumours turn into groundless stories,\u201d she added as the newlyweds read out rehearsed statements in a soberly decorated hotel function room.\n\nSince announcing their engagement in 2017, the couple has faced tabloid scandals and vicious online sniping over allegations that Komuro\u2019s family had run into financial difficulties.\n\nAfter much delay, they finally tied the knot with no wedding ceremony, reception banquet or any of the usual rites \u2014 opting to do so privately, away from a public that has not always been kind.\n\nMako also turned down a large payment usually offered to royal women on their departure, reportedly up to 153 million yen ($1.35 million), and they are now said to be planning a move to the United States.\n\nRoyals are held to exacting standards in Japan, and Mako has developed complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder because of the media attention, according to the Imperial Household Agency.\n\n\u201cI love Mako. We only get one life, and I want us to spend it with the one we love,\u201d Komuro said.\n\n\u201cI feel very sad that Mako has been in a bad condition, mentally and physically, because of the false accusations.\u201d\n\nThe couple did not answer questions from reporters verbally, to make the experience less stressful for Mako, the household said.\n\nBut in a document given to reporters, she said her condition was \u201cnot good\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Regrettable\u2019 situation \u2013\n\nWomen in the imperial family cannot ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne, and lose their royal status when they marry a commoner.\n\nTV footage showed the princess bid farewell to her family on Tuesday morning, bowing to her mother and father, Crown Prince Akishino, and hugging her sister.\n\nDespite the negative press coverage and small but angry protests against the marriage, more than half of respondents in a survey by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily said they thought it was a good thing.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that she is happy,\u201d Tokyo resident Machiko Yoshimoto, in her 60s, told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt would have been better to have a festive atmosphere, instead of this difficult situation, which is rather sad and regrettable,\u201d said Shigehiro Hashimoto, 54.\n\nWhile Japanese media initially fawned over Komuro, reports soon emerged that his mother had failed to repay a four-million-yen loan from a former fiance.\n\nAs pressure grew on the couple, the wedding was postponed and Komuro moved to New York for law school in 2018, a move seen as a bid to defuse negative attention.\n\nMako said on Tuesday she had encouraged Komuro to \u201cestablish a life overseas\u201d.\n\nTheir reported plan to move to the US, where Komuro works, has drawn inevitable comparisons with another royal couple who faced a media onslaught: Britain\u2019s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\n\nIt is not clear if Mako will work, but she is well qualified, having studied art and cultural heritage at Tokyo\u2019s International Christian University. She also holds a Master\u2019s degree from Britain\u2019s University of Leicester.\n\nThe Japanese throne can pass only to male members of the family, and the children of female royals who marry commoners are not included.\n\nThere has been some debate over changing the rules, and a government panel in July compiled notes on the issue including a proposal that royal women stay in the family, even after marriage.\n\nAlthough polls show the public broadly support women being allowed to rule, any change is likely to be slow, with traditionalists vehemently opposed.",
          "summary": "Japan\u2019s Princess Mako married her university sweetheart on Tuesday, but it was a low-key union bereft of traditional rituals, with the couple voicing sadness over the controversy that haunted their engagement.\nOur marriage is a necessary step for us to be able to protect our hearts,\u201d she told reporters after the marriage was registered.\n\u201cI have been scared, feeling sadness and pain whenever one-sided rumours turn into groundless stories,\u201d she added as the newlyweds read out rehearsed statements in a soberly decorated hotel function room.\nMako also turned down a large payment usually offered to royal women on their departure, reportedly up to 153 million yen ($1.35 million), and they are now said to be planning a move to the United States.\nIt is not clear if Mako will work, but she is well qualified, having studied art and cultural heritage at Tokyo\u2019s International Christian University.",

Buba Marwa (Retd) has lamented that Nigeria\u2019s drug addiction is thrice the global average.\n\nMarwa who ordered for the rooting out of drug barons and cartels from their various hideouts across the country, said: \u201cThe drug scourge in Nigeria is unacceptable with almost 15 million Nigerians abusing substances, 20 percent of who are addicted, which is three times the global average.\u201d\n\nThe NDLEA boss, said: \u201cWe are conscious of our job to block and prevent availability of narcotic drugs, and that necessitated the formation of the Strike Force to enhance our capability for complex operations. The Strike Force is the tip of our spear in our interdiction efforts and as such we must keep the tip sharpened and always ready to strike because we need to be two steps ahead of drug barons and cartels operating in the country.\u201d\n\nMarwa who gave the charge for the rooting out of the drug barons and cartels on Monday to officers and men of the agency\u2019s Strike Force Corps at the Graduation Ceremony of 143 officers from the Special Operations Training at the Nigerian Army School of Infantry, NASI, Jaji, Kaduna State.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith the training and graduation of these officers and men today, we serve a notice to the drug barons and cartels who are yet to get the message to quit the criminal trade that these well trained officers and men are coming to smoke them out as a formidable force anywhere in the country. As we equip and arm you well, be ruthless with the criminal gangs and merchants of death. Equally, I will implore you to display professionalism, discipline and respect for human rights in your operations.\u201d\n\nMarwa while disclosing that another batch of officers and men of NDLEA would be sent to NASI for similar training in the coming weeks, commended the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Farouk Yahaya, and the Armed Forces for the successes recorded so far in the fight against insecurity in the country.\n\nHe however tasked them not to rest on their oars, noting that \u201cfighting insecurity is not like a football match that ends at the end of 90 minutes.\u201d\n\nMarwa, while reminding the new graduands of their position within the agency, said: \u201cNote that the special nature of your training will require you to serve as a force multiplier to the conventional NDLEA officers in the field.\u201d\n\nHe said: Let me warn you of the hazard along the way. It will come in various forms, ranging from physical assaults to stupendous temptations by traders and traffickers of illicit drugs. When the tempests arise, rise above them. Let your sense of duty remain uncompromised. Let patriotism prevail over pecuniary interest. Let no temptation prevent you from discharging your duties to the best of your ability. In whatever situation you find yourself, remember to not forgo your training about the rules of engagement, especially the respect for human rights.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cIt is also important that you always bear in mind that there is little or no margin of error in the execution of your task as the safety of all NDLEA officers on assignment, including yourself, will, at times, depend on the speed, accuracy and efficiency of the Strike Force team providing cover for the mission. On such occasion, your training will be called to test.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Commandant, Nigerian Army School of Infantry, Maj. Gen. M.G. Ali, commended Marwa for repositioning NDLEA for efficiency and relevance within the country\u2019s security architecture. He said the training, as the first of its kind will enhance the Agency\u2019s capability to handle more complex challenges in its task of tackling drug barons and cartels.\n\nOther top Army Chiefs at the ceremony include the Commander, Nigerian Army Infantry Corps, Maj.

          "title": "Overcoming Scandal and PTSD, Japan\u2019s Princess Mako Finally Marries College Sweetheart",
          "text": "Japan\u2019s Princess Mako, the emperor\u2019s niece, has married her commoner college sweetheart on Tuesday and left the royal family after a years-long engagement beset by scrutiny that has left the princess with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nMako and fiance Kei Komuro, both 30, announced their engagement four years ago, a move initially cheered by the country. But things soon turned sour as tabloids reported on a money scandal involving Komuro\u2019s mother, prompting the press to turn on him. The marriage was postponed, and he left Japan for law studies in New York in 2018 only to return in September.\n\nTheir marriage consisted of an official from the Imperial Household Agency (IHA), which runs the family\u2019s lives, submitting paperwork to a local office in the morning, foregoing the numerous rituals and ceremonies usual to royal weddings, including a reception.\n\nMako also refused to receive a one-off payment of about $1.3 million typically made to royal women who marry commoners and become ordinary citizens, in line with Japanese law.\n\nTelevision footage showed Mako, wearing a pastel dress and pearls, saying goodbye to her parents and 26-year-old sister, Kako, at the entrance to their home. Though all wore masks in line with Japan\u2019s coronavirus protocol, her mother could be seen blinking rapidly, as if to fight off tears.\n\nThough Mako bowed formally to her parents, her sister grabbed her shoulders and the two shared a long embrace.\n\nIn the afternoon, Mako and her new husband will hold a news conference, which will also depart from custom. While royals typically answer pre-submitted questions at such events, the couple will make a brief statement and hand out written replies to the questions instead.\n\n\u201cSome of the questions took mistaken information as fact and upset the princess,\u201d said officials at the IHA, according to NHK public television.\n\nKomuro, dressed in a crisp dark suit and tie, bowed briefly to camera crews gathered outside his home as he left in the morning but said nothing. His casual demeanour on returning to Japan, including long hair tied back in a ponytail, had sent tabloids into a frenzy.\n\nMONEY SCANDAL\n\nJust months after the two announced their engagement at a news conference where their smiles won the hearts of the nation, tabloids reported a financial dispute between Komuro\u2019s mother and her former fiance, with the man claiming mother and son had not repaid a debt of about $35,000.\n\nThe scandal spread to mainstream media after the IHA failed to provide a clear explanation. In 2021, Komuro issued a 24-page statement on the matter and also said he would pay a settlement.\n\nPublic opinion polls show the Japanese are divided about the marriage, and there has been at least one protest.\n\nAnalysts say the problem is that the imperial family is so idealised that not the slightest hint of trouble with things such as money or politics should touch them.\n\nThe fact that Mako\u2019s father and younger brother, Hisahito, are both in the line of succession after Emperor Naruhito, whose daughter is ineligible to inherit, makes the scandal particularly damaging, said Hideya Kawanishi, an associate professor of history at Nagoya University.\n\n\u201cThough it\u2019s true they\u2019ll both be private citizens, Mako\u2019s younger brother will one day become emperor, so some people thought anybody with the problems he (Komuro) had shouldn\u2019t be marrying her,\u201d Kawanishi added.\n\nThe two will live in New York, though Mako will remain on her own in Tokyo for some time after the wedding to prepare for the move, including applying for the first passport of her life.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "Nigeria: NSA Monguno Warns IPOB Not to Disrupt Anambra Election",
          "text": "The National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno, on Monday, warned that nobody or group should test the resolve by the federal government to guarantee the November 6 gubernatorial election in Anambra State.\n\nThe NSA, who spoke at a meeting of inter-security agencies for the elections, where the INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu also said the commission was determined to ensure that the Anambra election takes place as scheduled, because according to him, 12 out of 14 items had already taken place.\n\nAlso, a coalition of civil society organisations based in the South-east has waded into alleged plans by separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to disrupt the forthcoming Anambra governorship election slated for November 6.\n\nMonguno, who was the co-chairman of election security in Nigeria, spoke against the backdrop of threat by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to disrupt the exercise and warned that, \u201cFor those of us in security, we have already done what we are supposed to do.\n\n\u201cAll security agencies have been asked to conduct themselves well in a professional manner and exhibit the highest level of professionalism and restraint and operate within the confines of the law, not in any way that will jeopardise the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are going to ensure that the people of Anambra undergo this exercise without any incident. We want to offer brotherly advice to our brothers, who want to destabilise the process to think again. We are all eager to achieve results that will be acceptable to everybody. I don\u2019t think it will be right for anyone to ignite crisis. Please, think again.\n\n\u201cYes, the law enforcement agencies will not sit by and allow people terrorise people, commit homicide. They have been told to watched out for these elements. I am appealing to you to stay in your wards and local governments and behave yourself. Anyone that wants to disrupt the process will be brought to book,\u201d the NSA warned.\n\nReiterating the importance of the November 6 governorship election, Monguno said, \u201cWe all know how important it is for us. Election is number one legitimate right of every citizen and we must not deny them that right in an atmosphere devoid of rancour and violence. Just like the chairman said, we need to do better than what we did in Edo and Ondo,\u201d he declared.\n\nOn the casualties so far suffered by security agencies and INEC staff in Anambra State, the NSA said, \u201cI know you have gone through a lot of pains, but don\u2019t allow that to dampen your spirit or get into lethargy. I wish you fruitful deliberations.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman, speaking earlier, said, \u201cOur deployment of non-sensitive materials and training of personnel for the election have virtually been concluded. The Commission has successfully accomplished 12 out of the 14 activities listed in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the election released in January this year.\n\n\u201cThe two outstanding activities are the last day of campaign, at midnight on Thursday 4th November 2021 and Election Day, which remains Saturday 6th November 2021. The REC for Anambra State is here to fully provide an update on the implementation of other activities and INEC\u2019s general state of readiness for the election.\n\n\u201cINEC is determined to proceed with the Anambra State Governorship election as scheduled. The safety and protection of voters, our personnel, accredited observers, the media and materials are cardinal considerations in any election. We have been assured by the security agencies of a secure environment for the election.\n\n\u201cI am sure the Commissioner Police, Anambra State, in his briefing, will provide more details regarding preparations on the ground. I wish to place on record the continued support of security agencies to the Commission during elections. Particularly noteworthy is the high level of professional conduct of the agencies in the last two major elections in Edo and Ondo States. Indeed, Edo and Ondo have become the standard for securing elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe professionalism and neutrality exhibited by the security agencies in the two elections have been widely praised nationally and internationally. We are confident that this will be replicated in Anambra State,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nHe, therefore, commended the security agencies for the support INEC had received from religious, traditional and community leaders for peaceful elections.\n\nHe said the commission was also working with the National Peace Committee under the leadership of a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, to bring all political parties and candidates for the Anambra State Governorship election to commit to peace before, during and after the election.\n\nYakubu later introduced two national commissioners sworn in yesterday. They are Kunle Cornelius Ajayi, a Professor of Political Science at the Ekiti State University and Muhammad Sani Kallah, a retired Professor of Ecology and Range Management at the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. They are the new national commissioners representing the South West and North West geo-political zones respectively.\n\nBut the civil society groups in the South-east, under the umbrella of Coalition of Southeast Democracy and Human Rights Organisations (CSBDHROs) said the action of the separatist group was targeted at the Anambra election.\n\nAddressing newsmen yesterday in Enugu at an International Press Conference, the organisations said disrupting the Anambra election would not be of any benefit to their struggle, rather, it would aid emergency rule, that would not be to the advantage of Anambra people.\n\nChairman Board of Trustees of International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr Emeka Umeagbalasi, who addressed journalists on behalf of other rights organisations, called on IPOB to rescind their decision, while also calling for the release of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on our brothers (IPOB) not to toe that line (disrupting election). When a group tells you that they will lockdown the South East from November 4 to November 10, and we know that Anambra has election on November 6 and November 7, what does that tell you? The election is the target.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell the IPOB people that nobody knows it all. We have been fighting their cause for a long time, because we know that what they are doing is within their fundamental human right. But we want to tell them that once in a while, they should make consultations.\n\n\u201cThey should sometimes reach out to people like us. The people you see here are leaders of CSOs, and seminal thinkers in the South east, ideas are our currency. We implore them to come to us and exchange ideas once in a while, because no one knows it all.\u201d\n\nThe groups said to disrupt the election by announcing a sit-at-home exercise on that day would mean calling for emergency rule in the state, which they said would ultimately give the state to the federal government and allow them to impose anyone on her, and that would not be fair.\n\n\u201cThat would allow the election to be massively and scientifically rigged or to be stopped will be disastrously calamitous and place the state under \u2018Khaki or Agbada Caliphate\u2019 and \u2018a nomadic rainforest state\u2019,\u201d Umeagbalasi appealed to the secessionists.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka and Gideon Arinze in Enugu",
