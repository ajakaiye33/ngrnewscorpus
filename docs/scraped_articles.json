          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nFalls 1.7% to $34.3bn, lowest in 12mths\n\nShows dim outlook in spite Eurobond prospect\n\nBy Babajide Komolafe\n\nNigeria\u2019s external reserves fell by 1.7 per cent, month-on-month (MoM) to $34.27 billion in May, the lowest level since May last year.\n\nThis follows a six weeks decline from April 16th, driven by increased dollar sales by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in its bid to clear its dollar demand backlog accruable to foreign portfolio investors, FPIs, estimated at $2 billion.\n\nSpeaking to the figures at the backdrop of the last week\u2019s meeting of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said: \u201cThe Committee noted the external reserves declined to $34.17 billion as at May 21, 2021, from $34.29 billion as at end-April 2021. This reflects sales to the foreign exchange market and third-party payments.\u201d\n\nData from the CBN showed that the reserves fell by $980 million during the six weeks, from $35.25 billion on April 16th to $34.27 billion on May 26th.\n\nThus while the reserves recorded a marginal increase of 0.2 per cent, MoM, in April, it declined in May by 1.7 per cent MoM to $34.27 billion.\n\nFurther analysis by Vanguard Public Finance showed that the reserves maintained a fluctuation over the months of this year, rising in January by $929 million or 2.6 per cent, MoM, to $36.3 billion from $35.37 billion in December, courtesy of rising crude oil prices and base effect.\n\nThe reserves, however, fell in February by $1.2 billion or 3.3 per cent, MoM, to $35.09 billion following increased dollar sales by the CBN. This trend persisted in March as the reserves fell again by $279 million or 0.7 per cent to $34.82 billion.\n\nThe marginal decline in March followed a two week upward trend in reserves, which commenced on March 18th from $34.42 billion to $34.82 billion at end of the month, resulting in $37 million accretion to the reserves.\n\nOutlook\n\nProspects for further accretion to the external reserves emerged last month, when the Director General of the Debt Management Office (DMO), Patience Oniha, said that the Federal Government has commenced plans for a Eurobond issuance with an open bid to select advisers. She said that the amount to be raised would be within the foreign borrowing plans for 2021.\n\nThis follows Senate approval in April of another $2.6 billion external loan request from President Muhammadu Buhari. The approved loan request comprises \u20ac995 million going to finance priority projects of the federal government and $1.5 billion for the thirty-six state governments to finance critical projects.\n\nOut of the total sum approved, $1.5 billion is to be sourced from the World Bank; \u20ac671 million euros from the Export-Import Bank of Brazil; and another \u20ac324 million euros from the Deutsche Bank of Germany.\n\nThe tenor/moratorium of the loan to be sought from the World Bank is 25 years at an interest rate of 2.45 percent per annum; while that from the Export-Import Bank of Brazil is for 15 years at an interest rate of 2.935 percent; and the loan request from the Deutsche Bank of Germany for seven (7) years at 2.87 percent interest rate.\n\nHowever, the approval for $1.5 billion expected from the World Bank, is subject to foreign exchange reforms by the CBN, especially unification of the exchange rates.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 views\n\nWhile these moves for new foreign loans and hence additional forex injection are expected to boost external reserves, analysts, however, cited the backlog of forex demand by FPIs as a major determining factor for stability in the reserves.\n\nAnalysts at Financial Derivatives Company, FDC, Limited noted that the decline in reserves may persist as the CBN intensifies its effort in clearing its forex demand backlog notwithstanding the fresh supply from the additional loans.\n\n\u201cWe expect the external reserves to fall below $34.7 billion in the near term as CBN intensifies its effort in clearing its forex demand backlog\u201d, they said.\n\nAnalysts at Vetiva Capital Management Limited also cited the clearing of the forex backlog as a factor in attracting dollar inflow from FPIs.\n\nThey said: \u201cGiven the decision of fiscal managers to adopt the NAFEX rate in official transactions, this could result in a price discovery process and reduce the official-parallel market gap, especially as the CBN quotes the closing NAFEX rate on its website in lieu of the de-facto peg of \u20a6379/$.\n\n\u2018\u2018To further narrow the gap between the NAFEX and parallel market rates, the CBN had made efforts to boost remittances via the introduction and indefinite extension of the Naira-4-Dollar Scheme, which has reduced volatility in the parallel market. Consequently, the apex bank\u2019s decisions on FX management would remain a headline to watch out for, especially as the Bank mulls over the framework of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the proposed Eurobond issuance will help the country move towards exchange rate correction, Managing Director of FDC Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, projected that the reserves could still decline by $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\n\u201c Our view is that a $4billion to $5bn disbursement to the market by the CBN will reduce external reserves by $2 billion to $3 billion\u201d.\n\nHe however added that this will allow the parallel market to converge towards N470/$, reduce naira liquidity in the system and push interest rates up at the interbank market by 300 to 400 basis points while also increasing supply of goods and parallel market discount will help moderate inflation.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Idahosa, represented by this Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Friday Idahosa, recently inspected the school and handed over some other constituency projects, among them newly constructed classroom blocks with furniture to the State Universal Basic Education Board, SUBEB.\n\nThe lawmaker noted that before his intervention in the school projects, children in some of the communities had to travel to neighbouring Ondo State to attend schools and the situation prevented many from going to school, while others who attended put their lives at risk.\n\nHe disclosed that there were over 14 ongoing school projects across the federal constituency, stressing that his desire was not only to ensure that the children learn under a conducive environment, but to also not have reason for not going to school.\n\n\u201cThe importance of education cannot be over- emphasized, hence, the reason I prioritize education is because of the need to secure a better future for our children,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe admonished the benefiting communities to see the projects as their own by protecting and maintaining the property.\n\nSUBEB applauds lawmaker\n\nThe representative of SUBEB, Mr. Egharevba Uhunoma, commended the lawmaker for the projects and made an appeal for the construction of more classrooms and fencing of Okoro II Primary School in Ovia South West Local Government Area.\n\nJoy unlimited \u2014 Mrs. Alufa, headmistress\n\nHead Mistress of Okoro Primary School, Mrs. Faith Alufa, stated that her joy knows no bounds for the laudable projects and commended the lawmaker for impacting the lives of the pupils.\n\nWe\u2018re excited \u2013 Mrs. Osahan\n\nOne of the rejoicing mothers, Mrs. Eunice Osahon, asserted: \u201cWe are so happy with what we are seeing, it means there is hope for the future of our children. One of my sons could not continue his education because we do not have a secondary school here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has to learn a trade though I would have loved him to go further in his education before learning a trade. This is because we do not have secondary school here, he had to stop after his primary education because we cannot afford to send him to Ondo State and that is the situation for many of our children,\u201d she revealed.\n\nEnrollment soars after lawmaker fenced Okada school\n\nAn indigene of Okada, Osato Idemudia, said that the fencing of Ekhaladeran Primary School has doubled enrollment in the school as parents were now sure of the safety of their children.\n\nSome of the buildings handed over were that of Obanosa Primary School, Iyekeze, Ovia North-East Local Government and Okoro Primary School, Okoro II, Ovia South- West Local Government.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nSpeaker of Cross River House of Assembly Eteng Jonah-Williams has said that Gov. Ben Ayade was not respected and honoured by the hierarchy of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) before his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nJonah-Williams, who spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Calabar, said that Ayade\u2019s defection from the PDP to the APC was timely.\n\nThe Speaker, who represents Yakurr II State Constituency in the Assembly, told NAN that out of the 25 House of Assembly members in the state, APC has 18, while the PDP has seven.\n\n\u201cBefore the governor took the decision, he consulted widely and the majority of the people told him that he needed to move to the APC.\n\n\u201cWhile in PDP, the governor was not respected and given the honour he deserved by the hierarchy of the PDP as the leader of the party in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, there was a need for him to move. The Governor has also stated clearly that he needed to align the state with the happenings in the centre for the interest of the state.\n\n\u201cCross River is known for always playing politics with the centre. Since 1999, former Governors Donald Duke and Liyel Imoke all played politics from the centre.\n\n\u201cAyade is the only governor from the state who has played opposition for six years now and he feels it is time to align with the centre for the benefit of the state,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recalled that during the last ward and chapter congresses of PDP in the state, the PDP national had to recognise a list of executive members who did not even contest for the positions at the ward and chapter level.\n\nHe said that such marginalisation of key stakeholders in the state by the PDP also informed their decision to defect with the governor to the APC.\n\n\u201cAs Speaker of Cross River House of Assembly, the ward list from my political ward that I have been winning elections with was neglected and a new list was constituted with members that I do not even know and nobody consulted me,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the Speaker, the remaining two years period of Ayade will attract the needed development from the centre into the state.\n\nHe gave assurance that APC will win all the elective positions in the state in the 2023 general elections in view of the governor\u2019s defection to the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe Superhighway and the Deep Seaport will now be given utmost attention by the Federal Government and other things will also fall in place as well.\n\n\u201cGov. Ayade has spent six years in office, I will advise him to consolidate on the gains of his industrial revolution in the state by completing the projects and privatising them for the future.\n\n\u201cThe House of Assembly wants the industries that were initiated by Gov.

The deep hatred and conspiracy of the British government in collaboration with Northern Arewa people exhibited against the people of Biafra during the Nigeria Biafra war are still very fresh in our memories. The spirit of Biafra can never be quenched.\u201d\n\nHe said the exercise would motivate the United Nations to consider granting a referendum to determine the independence of Biafr\u00e0.\n\n\u201cThe people of Biafra have once again demonstrated their unshakable and undeniable love and quest for Biafra.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s overwhelming compliance of the sit at the home commemoration of Biafra anniversary day will motivate the United Nations and other relevant international organs to consider organising a referendum to determine the independence of Biafra from the Nigeria state,\u201d he said.\n\nDescribing Ojukwu as an incorruptible leader, he noted that the personal sacrifices of the warlord would not be forgotten easily.\n\n\u201cOjukwu is incorrupt, eloquent and fearless. He sacrificed his father\u2019s wealth in pursuit of Biafra. He led Biafra with enthusiastic intimacy with the diverse indigenous ethnic tribes that made up the Biafra nation. His name and ideology are inseparable from Biafra. The person of General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu and ideology of Biafra are interwoven. Ojukwu still remains the greatest Biafra leader whose no living man can match his shoes.\n\n\u201cMASSOB extends our gratitude to the people of Biafra in diaspora and Biafra residents in Oduduwa, Arewa and Middle Beltan lands for honoring Biafra in compliance of observing the sit at home exercise.\n\n\u201cMASSOB salutes our traditional, religious, markets, political leaders. We acknowledged the leaders of transport unions, Keke unions, students unions, Banks and other commercial institutions for their obedience in complying with the sit-at-home exercise.

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nA grand design to boost Nigeria\u2019s internal security and revenue has made the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) to beam its searchlight on private jet owners, who are now mandated to carry out an immediate verification of their aircraft to ensure they are operating legally as enshrined in the Federal Government\u2019s extant laws.\n\nNCS Public Relations Officer, Joseph Attah, during a press briefing in Abuja, yesterday, said defaulters will be visited with the full weight of the law, saying no one will be treated as a sacred cow.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn line with the need to ensure strict compliance with all regulations, especially at this time of challenging security situation and reluctance of some highly placed individuals to pay taxes, NCS will be taking stock of all privately-owned aircraft in the country. This is to ensure strict compliance with all relevant regulations governing importation of such aircraft.\n\n\u201cConsequently, NCS, in line with its statutory functions as provided for in Part III Sections 27, 35, 37, 45, 46, 47, 52, 56, 63 & 64; Part XI Sections 144, 145, 155, 160, 161 & 164 and Part XII Sections 167, 168, 169 173 & 174 of the Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA), hereby invites owners of private aircraft in the country to come forward with their relevant importation clearance documents for verification.\u201d\n\nAttah said the documents sought for verification are: aircraft certificate of registration, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s (NCAA) Flight Operations Compliance Certificate, NCAA\u2019s Maintenance Compliance Certificate, NCAA\u2019s Permit for Non-Commercial Flights and Temporary Import Permit (where application).\n\nHe noted that all private jet owners or their representatives are to report to room 305, Tariff and Trade Department, NCS Headquarters, Abuja from Monday, June 7 through Tuesday, July 6, 2021 between 10:00am and 5:00pm daily, with relevant aircraft documents for verification.\n\nWhile clarifying that private jets do not pay Customs duties, Attah said such airplanes are expected to pay the mandatory Comprehensive Imports Supervision Scheme (CISS) charges.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure all charges due to the government are paid. The move is not punitive but to ensure compliance. If deficiencies are found, there will be room for correction.\n\n\u201cWe are aware Nigeria is facing security challenges and there is a downturn in global economy and so any legitimate thing that will boost our revenue is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe need to know who owns what and we want to know how they came in to ensure nothing untoward happened,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the likely sanctions defaulters might face, Attah said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to jump the gun on sanctions. But it depends on the gravity of the offence. We are not in a position to pre-empt anything. We believe private jet owners are highly-placed individuals that will do the right thing. They\u2019ll will do what the law says.\u201d\n\nIn another development, Attah disclosed Customs generated N799,024,705,961 between January 1 and May 30 this year.\n\nThe Customs spokesman described the figure as glaring improvement on N226,110,610,991 generated within the same period in 2020.\n\nHe said the feat was made possible due to strict implementation of all extant rules governing imports, exports and excise in Nigeria, strategic deployment of officers, automation of the processes and regulations, increasing inclination of officers and men to put national interest above selves, robust stakeholders\u2019 sensitisation, increasing level of compliance from stakeholders and improved working relation with National Assembly.\n\nAttah disclosed those who passed the aptitude test of the ongoing recruitment exercise have been invited for physical screening.\n\n\u201cWe are now ensuring we sieve out the issues like health, height and others, and soon, the final list will be out. Then, they\u2019ll come for documentation and later proceed for training,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u2022Banks, schools, govt offices, markets closed; streets deserted\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo, Gideon Arinze in Enugu, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki, Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia and Amby Uneze in Owerri\n\nThe five South-east states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, were shut down yesterday following the residents\u2019 compliance with the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe annual sit-at-home order, according to IPOB, is to honour fallen heroes of the Biafra in the 30-month civil war with Nigeria and those killed by security forces in the ongoing crackdown on separatist agitators.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that despite the assurance by the police that they would provide security for the people to go about their normal business, residents of the geopolitical zone, scared by possibility of violent attacks on defiant ones, kept indoors.\n\nStreets were devoid of human and vehicular movements; markets, schools as well as banks were shut.\n\nNot even threats of sanction from state governments could make civil servants to report for duty as government offices in the five states were also closed.\n\nHowever, a gun duel between the police and IPOB fighters within Ebebe junction in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, reportedly claimed five lives.\n\nIn Anambra State, there was total compliance with the sit-at-home order as streets around Awka, the state capital, were totally deserted at 7:30 am when THISDAY went round the city to monitor the compliance level.\n\nHowever, contrary to the information by the leader of the IPOB, Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, that men of the security arm of the group, Eastern Security Network (ESN), would be deployed in the streets to enforce compliance, some motorists attending to emergencies were allowed passage without molestation.\n\nThere was also heavy deployment of a combined team of security personnel who moved round the town to ensure that no one was molested.\n\nThe Anambra State Police Command had on Sunday assured the residents that it would ensure that those who were willing to come out to carry out their businesses would not be molested.\n\nMajor markets in the state, including Onitsha Main Market, Eke Awka Market and Nkwo Nnewi Market were shut down as at the time of filing this report.\n\nBut no incident of violence was registered in the state as a result of the exercise.\n\nThere was also total compliance in Ebonyi State as schools, banks, markets, motor parks, government offices and other public places were shut. There were also no human and vehicular movements within Abakaliki, the capital city.\n\nAn official of one of the banks at Awka, who sought not to be named, said in an interview with THISDAY that \u201cI am not in the office. The bank will not work for today. Who do you want to go to bank so that these people will come and kill them? I am at home. There is no movement and so who will you attend to?\u201d\n\nHowever, some people who defied the directive and went out in the early hours of yesterday returned home with injuries and their belongings destroyed.\n\nAll the streets were also deserted with heavy presence of security agencies and operatives of Ebubeagu at some designated junctions.\n\nViolence, resulting in sporadic gunshots and destruction of property, were witnessed in some parts of Ebonyi State.\n\nThe sporadic gun duel between the police and the agitators within Ebebe junction in Abakaliki capital city reportedly claimed five lives.\n\nWhile the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Aliyu Garba, confirmed that some of the suspected agitators were arrested, there was no official report on the alleged death of a policeman and four IPOB members.\n\nHowever, a source at the Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, said the police brought in about four corpses to the morgue.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that some of the agitators divided themselves into groups and laid ambush in a forest along Ogbaga Road, where they intercepted anyone who flouted the directive on sit-at-home. They were said to have beaten up the violators and set their belongings ablaze.\n\nAn eyewitness said that many motorcycles were burnt while their riders fled with injuries.\n\nA student of Ebonyi State University also told THISDAY that the sit-at-home order disrupted academic activities.\n\nAnother school proprietor had also notified to parents and guardians earlier that the school would not open today.\n\nEmpty streets, deserted roads, closed shops and business premises characterised the observance of the Biafra Day in Umuahia, the Abia State capital and Aba, the commercial nerve centre of the state.\n\nResidents of the two major Abia cities fully complied with the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe city centre of Umuahia was devoid of its usual bustling commercial activities as people remained in indoors.\n\nCommercial transporters also withdrew their vehicles, while private vehicles deserted the roads.\n\nGovernment institutions were also affected by the sit-at-home directive as schools and government offices did not open.\n\nBanks and other corporate businesses equally shut their gates.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, there was no presence of the police and other security agencies patrolling the streets in Umuahia.\n\nThe separatist agitators also comported themselves peacefully while marking the Biafra Day as there was no street parade, which usually attracted heavy response from security agencies as happened on previous occasions.\n\nKanu had while giving directives on the observance of this year\u2019s Biafra Day strictly warned against any street protest, saying that people should stay indoors and mourn the fallen heroes.\n\nThe order also recorded total compliance in Enugu State.\n\nAs early as 8am yesterday, major markets within the Enugu metropolis, including Abakpa, New Haven, Garki, and Holy Ghost were shut.\n\nMarkets in Nsukka areas were also empty.\n\nMotor parks and other commercial places were equally deserted.\n\nStreets that were usually filled with people were empty even as there were no vehicular movements.\n\nPolice patrol vans were seen around Okpara Avenue, adjacent to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) office, Enugu.\n\nThe Enugu State Police Command had on Sunday, urged the residents of the state to disregard the order, warning that anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions would be dealt with.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists by the Police Public Relations Officer, Enugu State Command, Daniel Ndukwe, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, had enjoined residents of the state to remain law-abiding, vigilant, as they went about their legitimate businesses.\n\nThe order also recorded 100 per cent compliance in Imo State.\n\nPrevious directives to mark the declaration of Biafra did not record the level of compliance observed in the state yesterday.\n\nAnalysts, however, attributed the total compliance this year to the heightened insecurity in the state.\n\nThe murder of a top chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and former political adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Hon. Ahmed Gulak, on Sunday morning had heightened the fears of Imo residents and forced them to stay indoors.\n\nAll the major streets in the state capital and every entry and exit points to and from the state were empty as motorists and travellers avoided passing through the state. The ever-busy Wetheral Road, Douglas Road, Royce Road, Okigwe Road, Orlu Road, Onitsha Road, Port Harcourt Road and Aba Road were all empty.\n\nHowever, security agents were alleged to have used the occasion of sit-at-home order to raid some of the hostels and lodges of students of Imo State University, Owerri (IMSU) to arrest some of them.\n\nA tweet from one of the student leaders had alerted the public to the arrest.\n\nEfforts to speak with the state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, a Superintendent of Police, proved abortive as he did not answer calls placed to his phone.\n\nShedding light on why there was total compliance with the sit-at-home order, spokesman of the pan-Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Hon. Alex Ogbonnia, told THISDAY from his residence in Enugu that every Igbo person felt the sense of injustice against the Igbo in Nigeria and was a willing participant in the sit-at-home protest to register their displeasure.\n\nHe said: \u201cEven the governors of the South-east states know what is happening. It is a simple way of showing that the marginalisation of the Igbo is becoming unbearable. We are hoping the presidency will address some of these concerns. If for instance, an Igbo man is announced as the Inspector General of Police or Chief of Army Staff, the people will jubilate. If there is a consensus to cede the presidency to the South-east in 2023, all these agitations will die naturally. You can\u2019t continue to oppress a people who are very hardworking and contribute so much to the development of the country and expect them to celebrate their subjugation.\u201d\n\nAlso, President of Igbo Youth Movement, Mr. Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, said the refusal of the federal government to discuss with the agitators had strengthened their resolve to press home their demands.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe strange policy to only shoot and destroy the agitators without ever inviting them to present their position has convinced the people of this region that they are in a hostile political jail. The world over and all through history when between 5,000 and 10,000 people agitate about a situation the government of the land invites them to present their grievance. Nigeria is the only country where hundreds of thousands of people have been protesting over a particular situation in the last 21 years and the government continues to refuse to listen to them. Instead, thousands of them have been killed in cold blood.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Say dialogue, restructuring only ways to address Nigeria\u2019s challenges\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe leadership of major socio-cultural groups from Southern and Middle Belt part of Nigeria yesterday charted a new path for the emergence of a new constitution for Nigeria.\n\nTheir proposals, made at a dialogue session christened, \u2018The \u2018Nigeria\u2019s 2023 Presidential Transition Inter-ethnic Peace Dialogue,\u2019 in Abuja, came against the backdrop of the ongoing constitution review process being carried out by the National Assembly through public hearings in all the six geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nThe groups adopted a common position urging for an emergency national conference to birth a new constitution and pave the way for the restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nThe socio-cultural groups, comprising Afenifere (South-west), Ohanaeze (South-east), Middle Belt and Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), said it was possible to reverse the current challenges facing Nigeria if the federal government could implement their recommendations.\n\nConvener of the summit, Kennedy Iyere, said Nigeria might not make reasonable progress in 2023 if no genuine dialogue was held to address contentious issues.\n\nLeader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, while presenting the position of the Yoruba, which was also adopted by both the Ohanaeze and Middle Belt Forum, said the process for a genuine consensus on an acceptable national constitution should henceforth begin with the production of position documents by all nationalities between now and December.\n\nHe stated that going forward, Nigerians should be allowed to exercise their mandate and sovereignty on how they want to live together under mutually beneficial terms.\n\nHe added that the various regions in the country should be allowed to choose the type of government they want to adopt within their area, under a truly federal structure, which will guarantee some measure of autonomy and control over resources and policing of their entities.\n\nAccording to him, there should be no artificially prescribed number of regions in a manner that may foreclose the rights of the people that desire to organise themselves as a semi- autonomous regional member of the Nigerian state so long as the territory desiring such regional status can guarantee its self-sustenance and viability as an entity.\n\nAdebanjo said: \u201cFlowing from the above, something like the United Regions of Nigeria (URN) is hereby proposed.\n\n\u201cIn this proposal, powers, mandate and authority to formulate the articles of association to form the Central Government of Nigeria shall in effect lie jointly and severally with the ethnic nationalities occupying their respective territories and not with lawmakers who were randomly picked.\n\n\u201cNigeria shall be subsequently organised into a union or federation of voluntarily associating and cooperative regional entities like we had up till 1966. Unlike what we have presently, each region may have a constitution of its own which would spell out how it is to be governed.\n\n\u201cThere would be a national constitution binding all the regions in the country together. In this latter, constitution would spelt out mutually agreed terms under which the peoples of the country agree to cohabit together as citizens of the same country.\u201d\n\nHe added that the proposal should serve as a template to encourage other ethnic nationalities to organise themselves and prepare terms that would guide their relationship with each other in the country in a harmonious and mutually respecting manner.\n\n\u201cFrom such collation of terms would emerge regional constitutions out of which National Constitution would be forged. The constitution, be it at regional or national level, must accord unqualified respect to democratic norms and the rights of the people to actively participate in matters that have to do with their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nAdebanjo added that the constitution must also emphasise true federalism in such a way that no region or area would have power to lord it over another region or area.\n\nAmong the expected contents of the envisaged regional constitutions as envisaged by Afenifere are unreserved powers of the regions over natural resources in their respective areas, like agriculture, education, health, electricity, security and economy.\n\nHe also proposed that each region should contribute 10 per cent of what it generates to the national purse, while retaining 30 per cent; with the states taking 35 per cent and the local governments taking 25 per cent.\n\nAdebanjo said in order to ensure that the proposal would not be abandoned like other reports that have come from various panels or assemblages constituted by governments, timeline would be suggested to guide the process.\n\nAccording to him, under the proposal, ethnic nationalities should be encouraged to prepare their document on terms of engagement between now and December 2021.\n\n\u201cThe documents from the nationalities in which they propose the kind of regional government they want to form be collated and considered between January and March 2022.\n\n\u201cThe product of this process should then produce the document that will become the Constitution of the United Regions of Nigeria or Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA national referendum can be conducted on the adoption of the final Constitution for the Restructured Nigeria around the middle of 2022. The said constitution can then become effective from October 01, 2022.\n\n\u201cA committee can be set up to work out the details of the proposal hereby suggested. We are ready to present the details as we conceive it to the said committee if formed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Afenifere leader also described as erroneous attempts to equate agitations for self-determination by groups in the South with secession. He said issue of true federalism must be central in every constitution or article of engagement for the federating units.\n\nHe added that the concept of true federalism that is acceptable to Afenifere is that which emphasises self-determination.\n\nOn its part, Ohanaeze said while it endorsed the proposals by Afenifere, there should be an emergency national conference to consider the proposals of various ethnic groups and also to review the reports of previous national conferences so as to come up with a new constitution accepted by all.\n\nFormer Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, who made the presentation on behalf of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide President General, Ambassador George Obiozor, said the genesis of the problem being witnessed in the country started when the military took over power in 1966 and removed the federal constitution that would have guided the country to a viable economic and political entity.\n\nEarlier, Obiozor who spoke briefly before leaving the meeting for another engagement, warned that no one should be under any illusion that he could pocket the rest of the country and dictate what they should do.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ghali Umar Na\u2019Abba, urged Nigerians to focus on issues that promote national unity, adding that \u201cany region that decided to pull out of Nigeria will not leave the way they think it is going to be.\u201d\n\nHowever, tension was raised when the leader of the Northern Consensus Initiative, Dr. Awal Abdullahi, said that the North was no longer opposed to a breakup of the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe North before now was saying we don\u2019t believe in separation, but as I\u2019m standing, I\u2019m telling you that if there is going to be separation tomorrow, the North is ready for it; we are also ready. Let\u2019s go our different ways and I am telling you this with all sincerity. Northern Nigeria before now did not want to hear anything separation but as at today, as I speak to you, the North is equally ready.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying might be controversial, but I am speaking the mind of Northerners and I have no apology to anyone in this hall, although I respect the leaders and elders here but I have no apology to anybody on what I say.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Leader of the Middle Belt Forum, Mr. Pogu Bitrus, countered Abdullahi\u2019s position, saying that the Middle Belt will not pull out of the country with the core North.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo if my brother says the North is going, be sure the Middle-Belt is not going with you; you are on your own. We have served and sacrificed for this country. The war that occurred, the Middle-Belt was used to fight while the North sat back to enjoy.\u201d\n\nBitrus stated that the Middle Belt has adopted the proposal of Afenifere and Ohanaeze as a common position on ways to rescue the country.\n\nHe added that the 2023 general election can only hold if the government enacts electoral law approving electronic voting.\n\nHe said the region also supported the restructuring of the country.\n\nPresident of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Mr. Jonathan Asake, also supported the call for a national dialogue to fashion out a new constitution that will guarantee equity and fairness to all nationalities in the country.\n\nAlso, another group, the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace (IDPF), met yesterday in Abuja and canvassed a national dialogue to address the challenges facing Nigeria.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 jointly signed by the Co-chairmen of IDPF, Mr. Kunle Sanni Ishaq and Bishop Sunday Onuoha, the religious leaders said: \u201cWe are using this medium to appeal to the Nigerian governments to do the needful by organising a national dialogue so as to provide a forum for holistic suggestions and recommendations that will bring about the new Nigeria that will address the yearnings and aspirations of the citizens, as well as ensuring public safety and protection.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u202280 winners get award certificates\n\n\u2022NNPC eyes stakes in five more private refineries\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) yesterday concluded the 2020 marginal oilfield bid round, the first successful bid since 2003 when 24 assets were put on offer.\n\nThe process, which culminated in the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja by the industry regulator, started in June last year, with 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore put up for lease by the federal government.\n\nThis came just as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday unfolded plans to acquire shares in five more private refineries in Nigeria, bringing to six its interests in refineries it is targeting.\n\nHowever, during the bid round, the DPR stated that 161 successful companies were shortlisted to advance to the final stage. Those shortlisted were selected from 591 entities that applied for pre-qualification.\n\nMarginal fields are smaller oil blocks typically developed by indigenous companies and have remained unproduced for a period of over 10 years.\n\nSome of the companies, which emerged winners included: Matrix Energy, AA Rano, Andova Plc, Duport Midstream, Genesis Technical, Twin Summit, Bono Energy, Deep Offshore Integrated, Oodua Oil, MRS and Petrogas.\n\nOthers are: North Oils and Gas, Pierport, Metropole, Pioneer Global, Shepherd Hill, Akata, NIPCO, Aida, YY Connect, Accord Oil, Pathway Oil, Tempo Oil and Virgin Forest, among others.\n\nIt was a big win for local oil and gas companies, which had a good outing during the ceremony as 100 per cent of the beneficiaries of the exercise were indigenous entities.\n\nNigeria last conducted marginal field bid rounds in 2003, with 16 of the fields now contributing just two per cent to the national oil and gas reserves, a figure the DPR said would be substantially boosted by the latest exercise, worth about $500 million in signature bonuses.\n\nAt the presentation of letters to the winners, DPR Director, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, stated that a total of 591 firms submitted expression of interest forms, out of which 540 were pre-qualified, while 482 were bids submitted by 405 applicants.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the end, 161 companies were shortlisted as potential awardees, out of which 50 per cent has met all conditions and therefore eligible for awards today. We are set to ensure opportunities are extended to other deserving applicants to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cThe DPR is not just a regulator, we are an opportunity house. We drive creativity and transformation and we use these in all of our activities. This is done in the overriding national interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bid will enhance economic growth, increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and create employment, while with the experience garnered before now, mistakes of the past will be avoided.\n\nHe said that the desire of the government was for the awardees to hit \u201cfirst oil\u201d in record time, adding that a technical workshop will be organised with all bid winners for guidance on field development and operations.\n\nHe pledged to support the bid winners to operate within the country\u2019s oil and gas space, urging them to take advantage of the oil and gas centre recently inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cDespite the daunting challenges of the triple force (oil price crash, global pandemic and production cuts) in 2020, which dealt a severe blow on the world market and global economy, the DPR forged ahead with government aspirations for the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the exercise was carried out in two phases, expression of interest and prequalification, as well as technical and financial phase.\n\nHe said the phase one ensured that applicants were subjected to screening of basic documentations such as shareholders\u2019 details, directors, management team, procedures and systems, legal and association status, basic technical capability, financial capability and corporate accountability.\n\nAuwalu stated that the DPR has now provided opportunities through the marginal field bid round to indigenous operators for wealth creation and economic growth consistent with government\u2019s drive for increased GDP, employment generation and improved revenue.\n\n\u201cThe DPR will continue to follow up and guide the awardees every step of the way. For instance, a guiding template of working agreement has been drafted for joint awardees and discussions have reached advanced stage between DPR and lease holders on the Farmout agreement and other technical enablers,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Head, Basinal Assessment and Lease Administration (BALA) of the organisation, Mr. Edu Inyang, said when the exercise was being embarked upon, the objectives were to increase indigenous participation in the oil and gas industry, increase reserves, rev up technological transfer, attract investment and enhance revenue generation.\n\nHe stated that a large part of the objectives had been achieved, with the culmination of the process in the presentation of letters.\n\nAssistant Director, DPR, Mr. Abel Nsa, in his remarks, said with the revocation of 11 licences, Nigeria was losing a lot of revenue, with taxes and royalties not being paid on the assets, leaving about 40 million barrels unproduced and many opportunities missed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "New information available to SaharaReporters shows how the suspended Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman, lied to her superiors and sabotaged the plan by the Nigerian government to decongest Lagos ports by dredging the Calabar Port.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Usman lied to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and the Senate about the recommendations of a committee she had set up to investigate the dredging project at the Calabar Port.\n\nHadiza Bala Usman\n\nHer lies have cost Nigeria lives, billions of naira and jobs as Nigeria continues to rely on Lagos ports with its attendant congestion and other problems, it was also gathered.\n\nFor instance, widespread congestion at the Lagos ports costs Nigeria $55 million (about N20.8 billion) daily, according to a 2020 report by Dynanmar, a Dutch consultancy firm.\n\nAccording to sources in the industry, Usman consistently lied to Osinbajo, Chairman of the Presidential Task Team on the Apapa gridlock, tasked with the job of decongesting the Lagos ports, that dredging the Calabar Port was not viable.\n\nThe project is under Calabar Channel Management, a joint venture operation between a consortium led by Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited and the Nigerian Ports Authority.\n\nFollowing allegations that money was paid for dredging at Calabar Port with nothing to show for it, Usman set up a committee to investigate three allegations: One, that Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited did not follow due process in carrying out the job; two, that dredging Calabar Ports is not viable and must not be done; and three, that work was not done on the site by the company.\n\nThe report of the committee along with other documents sighted by SaharaReporters indeed prove that work had commenced at Calabar Port and that it was viable, but Usman ignored the report of the committee and insisted that the job must be stopped.\n\nSources privy to the issue said Usman took the position because he wanted the job for her cronies and not a neutral company.\n\nOne of the sources privy to the committee\u2019s report said, \u201cShe (Hadiza Bala-Usman) has been hiding the truth. The job was suspended after President Muhammadu Buhari came in. There were allegations that money was paid and that the job was not done. Then she set up a committee.\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been in charge of how they can reduce traffic in Lagos so he put pressure on her and she said she would set up a committee to make recommendations. She was in London, UK when the report came out but said nobody should sign the report.\n\n\u201cLater, she granted interviews to newspapers, saying the committee indicted the company (Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited), which was totally a lie. Her lies have cost the country so much money because dredging the Calabar Port would have decongested Lagos ports. It would have made more money for the government and created many jobs.\n\n\u201cThe committee members; we said we had to sign it. Later she said we should sign. But when Osinbajo and the Senate asked about it, she said the job should not continue, contrary to what is in the report. She told the Vice President that dredging should not be done because it was not viable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirmed the first (that Niger Global followed due process) and we hired a consultant from Switzerland to find out if work had been done and they showed work had been done. Nigerian Navy also wrote that they provided security for the dredger at the time it was working.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss company is called Coastal And Reclamation Engineering Services, popularly referred to as CARES. This company is being appointed by the NPA to regularly audit the three channel management namely; Lagos Channel Management (LCM), Bonny Channel Management (BCM) and Calabar Channel Management (CCM). Payments of work done can only be made to contractors after CARES audited the job and confirmed that work was done.\n\n\u201cThe company also confirmed that work had started there but she hid the truth and refused to share the content of the report with the Ministry of Transportation. And not dredging the Calabar Port is costing Nigeria a lot in terms of money and jobs for the teeming population.\n\n\u201cUsman mischievously questioned the work of its one hired Auditors (CARES) on Calabar channel management but at the same time accepted and made payments to LCM and BCM on the advice of the same auditor. She wanted to give the job to her cronies and consistently lied to the Vice President, AGF and the Senate.\n\n\u201cNobody except the members knows the content of the committee\u2019s report, not the Vice President or even the Ministry of Transportation or the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. She is interested in taking the job and giving it to her cronies,\u201d another source said.\n\nSaharaReporters sighted the report of the committee set up to review the activities of Calabar Channel Management Limited done in November 2016.\n\nThe committee members are listed as: Prof Idris Abubakar, Executive Director, E&TS; Engr. Peter Obinomen, General Manager, Capital Projects; Engr. A. R. Mohammed, General Manager, PP&D; Engr. A. A. Jatto, General Manager, Engineering Maintenance; A. A. Ningi, General Manager, Audit; Nana Yakubu, Assistant General Manager, Legal; Surveyor O. Omotoso, Assistant General Manager, Hydro; Engr M. U. Isa, Principal Manager, BD&JV.\n\nThe committee\u2019s terms of reference were stated thus: \u201cto carry out a holistic review of the Joint Venture Agreement between the NPA and Niger Global, to examine the request for payments by Niger Global received vide letter ref. T0160/S107/IXA/205 dated 15th August, 2016 from the office of the Minister of Transportation, to examine the operational and administrative effectiveness of CCM, to make appropriate recommendations to management.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations of the committee among others as stated in the document say, \u201cHaving verified volumes dredged, all outstanding payments due to CCML should be effected in line with the provisions of the JV Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat in view of the subsisting presidential approval for the JV, CCML be allowed to continue with its operation but at a reduced scale to be determined by the authority\u2019s need and CCML\u2019s Board Technical and Finance Committees.\n\n\u201cThat henceforth, a multi-disciplinary project management team made of civil engineers, surveyors, hydrographers be appointed with definite responsibility to manage the dredging activities of all the channel management companies (LCM, BCC &CCML).\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter she wrote to the Minister of Justice, Malami, the suspended NPA MD said the contractor connived with the consultant and lied to the NPA that work was done. She also lied to the minister that no key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done.\n\nThe letter dated June 5, 2018 and received by the ministry on June 8, 2018 was signed by I.G. Umar, Assistant General Manager, Board, for NPA Managing Director.\n\nThe letter was titled \u2018Re: Execution Summary of the Entire Argument Surrounding the Calabar Channel Management Contract at the Truth Verifiably Documentary Evidence\u2019.\n\nPart of Usman\u2019s letter to Malami read: \u201cThe committee found amongst others; that the Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer (two key officers) who should be involved in the dredging exercise denied that any dredging activities took place within the period claimed by Niger Global, the ship movement of the dredgers MV Atlantico, MV Hurricane and MV Waterway could not be substantiated by the Calabar port, the pre and post comparison of the depth of the channel with a survey carried out six months before the dredging exercise revealed that the alleged dredging of the areas of the channel was questionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this same consultant is having a valid contact with the NPA and it is the same consultant that is confirming work of both Bonny and Lagos channel managements and the same MD is making payment to these companies on the basis of confirmation of work by the same consultant she\u2019s accusing of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe second big lie she told the minister is that no any key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nBut the report of the committee shows that Port Hydrographer, a key officer of the NPA, was a member of the technical committee and signed under a report which confirmed that work was done.\n\nA letter from the Nigerian Navy dated July 2017 with ref VT: 015/73/200/Vol.IV/70, made available to SaharaReporters also showed the suspended NPA MD was hiding the true state of things.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Managing Director, Calabar Channel Management Company, was titled, \u2018Provision of Security Services to the Dredging Company for Calabar Channel for the period 20 November, 2014 to 15 January, 2015\u2019.\n\nIt says, \u201cThis is to confirm that the Nigerian Navy through NNS VICTORY Calabar provided all the security services to the personnel and equipment of Calabar Channel Management Company for the successful execution of dredging exercise. The operation was hitch-free based on our assessment hence there was no security breach during the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment, nobody including the minister (Amaechi) and the President is aware of the true outcome of that committee report because she refused to let them have a copy of the report and she only keeps telling them and Nigerians that the committee report indicted the contractor.\n\n\u201cShe has granted many interviews in which she told lies about the whole contract. She\u2019s a pathological liar and always knows how to get away with all this. Her arrogance and disregard for working ethics have cost Nigeria a lot and still cost Nigeria hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. She is the reason why Calabar Port has not been dredged and Lagos ports decongested,\u201d added one of the sources.\n\nDocuments by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Channel_Committee Review Signed Copy by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Port Update Post Privatization Monitoring by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nJoint Confirmatory Survey by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

Umar, Assistant General Manager, Board, for NPA Managing Director.\n\nThe letter was titled \u2018Re: Execution Summary of the Entire Argument Surrounding the Calabar Channel Management Contract at the Truth Verifiably Documentary Evidence\u2019.\n\nPart of Usman\u2019s letter to Malami read: \u201cThe committee found amongst others; that the Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer (two key officers) who should be involved in the dredging exercise denied that any dredging activities took place within the period claimed by Niger Global, the ship movement of the dredgers MV Atlantico, MV Hurricane and MV Waterway could not be substantiated by the Calabar port, the pre and post comparison of the depth of the channel with a survey carried out six months before the dredging exercise revealed that the alleged dredging of the areas of the channel was questionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this same consultant is having a valid contact with the NPA and it is the same consultant that is confirming work of both Bonny and Lagos channel managements and the same MD is making payment to these companies on the basis of confirmation of work by the same consultant she\u2019s accusing of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe second big lie she told the minister is that no any key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nBut the report of the committee shows that Port Hydrographer, a key officer of the NPA, was a member of the technical committee and signed under a report which confirmed that work was done.\n\nA letter from the Nigerian Navy dated July 2017 with ref VT: 015/73/200/Vol.IV/70, made available to SaharaReporters also showed the suspended NPA MD was hiding the true state of things.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Managing Director, Calabar Channel Management Company, was titled, \u2018Provision of Security Services to the Dredging Company for Calabar Channel for the period 20 November, 2014 to 15 January, 2015\u2019.\n\nIt says, \u201cThis is to confirm that the Nigerian Navy through NNS VICTORY Calabar provided all the security services to the personnel and equipment of Calabar Channel Management Company for the successful execution of dredging exercise. The operation was hitch-free based on our assessment hence there was no security breach during the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment, nobody including the minister (Amaechi) and the President is aware of the true outcome of that committee report because she refused to let them have a copy of the report and she only keeps telling them and Nigerians that the committee report indicted the contractor.\n\n\u201cShe has granted many interviews in which she told lies about the whole contract. She\u2019s a pathological liar and always knows how to get away with all this. Her arrogance and disregard for working ethics have cost Nigeria a lot and still cost Nigeria hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. She is the reason why Calabar Port has not been dredged and Lagos ports decongested,\u201d added one of the sources.\n\nDocuments by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Channel_Committee Review Signed Copy by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Port Update Post Privatization Monitoring by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nJoint Confirmatory Survey by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "title": "How Uche Ogboi became CEO of Lori Systems and her billion-dollar mission for African logistics",
          "text": "As CEO of Lori Systems, Uche Ogboi will bear some of the weight of African logistics on her shoulders.\n\nWhen Lori Systems started operations in Kenya in 2016, Uche Ogboi was nearing the end of an eventful eight-year career as an investment banker at Citi.\n\nShe had led the multinational bank\u2019s fund for small businesses and helped deploy billions of dollars for projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.\n\nA year later, Lori would be the star startup at TechCrunch\u2019s first-ever Battlefield Africa competition, winning $25,000. One of the judges at the event was Eghosa Omoigui, the founding partner at EchoVC Partners, a Nigerian venture capital firm. Ogboi had joined EchoVC as an associate principal, helping the firm\u2019s portfolio companies figure out operations.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, first met Ogboi in 2017. When they met again in 2019, Ogboi was now principal at EchoVC and was directly involved in the VC firm\u2019s investment in Lori\u2019s Series A round.\n\nHer due diligence process impressed Sandler who was looking out for someone to bring structure and help scale the logistics startup\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cShe was so incredibly structured and process-driven,\u201d Sandler says to TechCabal in a joint interview with Ogboi.\n\n\u201cShe understood what we were doing and pushed us in new directions. Lori needed her.\u201d\n\nJoining Lori and multitasking\n\nOgboi joined Lori as Chief Operations Officer (COO) in July 2019, four months before the Series A raise was announced. But in her first few months at Lori, Ogboi had to do more than be COO to immerse herself in the thorny business of logistics in Africa.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t functionally do the role until over a year in. I started by experiencing almost every role in the business because that was needed,\u201d she says.\n\nUche Ogboi. Image credit: Lori Systems.\n\nShe was on the field managing cargo departures and overseeing transportation. For a time, she filled in as the startup\u2019s chief financial officer for their operations in East and West Africa.\n\n\u201cThat experience has allowed me to work very closely and empathize with every part of the team, as well as with customers and transporters. I have seen the business from all sides.\u201d\n\nThis boots-on-the-ground experience of the business helped her understand logistics pain points. It clarified how technology will ultimately drive solutions that relieve those pains.\n\n\u201cFor our investors and stakeholders, I know and understand what it takes to scale Lori to become a multi-billion-dollar company on the continent.\u201d\n\nDeploying to Nigeria and saving costs\n\nOne of Lori\u2019s goals is to help clients save cost by up to 20%. While they have historically achieved that, Sandler credits Ogboi for some transformations that have happened since 2019.\n\nUntil Ogboi joined, the startup was largely an East African company in two Kenyan cities (Nairobi and Mombasa) and Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Sandler ran the company with Jean-Claude Homawoo, as co-founder and chief product officer.\n\nAs part of her first task, Ogboi scaled Lori\u2019s official expansion to Nigeria in the second half of that year. In doing so, she increased competition in Nigeria\u2019s tech-enabled logistics sector which already included startups like Kobo360 and TradeDepot.\n\nAccording to Sandler, she grew the Nigerian business tenfold within that first year. In 2020, she kept the entire organisation lean when COVID-19 disrupted regular flow at borders, helping the company save 40% of costs and nearly doubling margins.\n\nBy mid-2020, Ogboi\u2019s actions in shaping Lori\u2019s adjustment to the pandemic led Sandler to have deeper thoughts about the startup\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw Uche in action, it became even more clear that as Lori continues to grow, she should be the person at the helm of this organisation,\u201d Sandler says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a quick decision but by December, conversations became more serious, setting a succession plan in motion that would lead to her appointment as CEO, with effect from July 1, 2021.\n\nA rare CEO leading an African first-mover\n\nSandler, a South African, will become Lori\u2019s Executive Chairman while Ogboi takes the wheel as the startup\u2019s visionary.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, will become Executive Chairman\n\nShe hopes to lean into her ten-year \u201ccocktail of experiences\u201d from investment banking through venture capital to drive Lori\u2019s mission of being the platform that makes every node in the logistics value chain efficient, thereby lowering haulage costs in Africa.\n\nSome factors like poor road infrastructure and policy inconsistencies will be out of her control.\n\nAs of 2018, the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index ranked Kenya 68th, Uganda 102nd and Nigeria 110th out of 160 countries.\n\nBut Ogboi\u2019s main anchor for changing the space \u2013 the focus of her leadership at Lori \u2013 will be further exploring the power of digital technology for logistics. At the moment, Lori provides clients with real-time information on goods and trucking assets through web-based apps.\n\nSo what\u2019s next on their technology roadmap: Internet of Things? Augmented Reality for warehousing? Blockchain for trucking?\n\nLogistics-tech companies like Lori may not solve Lagos traffic or build roads in Kampala. But they hope to exert influence through technology.\n\nOgboi does not give specifics. But she says they are working on some things over the next few months that will help them \u201cscale much quicker.\u201d\n\nOn one hand, it should be inevitable that someone as experienced should lead a mission as big. In reality, Ogboi is one of only a handful of female tech CEOs in Africa. She takes a deep breath and acknowledges the sad reality but knows she is in a position to drive more women up the ladder in other tech startups but especially at Lori.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has recovered from 2020\u2019s shock. It is back to its pre-COVID growth rates of 20% month over month. Last November, they received an undisclosed investment and signed a partnership agreement with Imperial Logistics, a global logistics company.\n\nSandler is confident that Ogboi will increase Lori\u2019s partnerships and relationships. Under his leadership, Lori helped move cargo worth billions of dollars; he looks forward to trillions with Ogboi in charge.\n\nNo pressure, huh?\n\nFor the new CEO \u2013 a mother of two daughters \u2013 it has been tradition to wake in the middle of the night to think about Lori. Now she\u2019ll probably sleep even less with the weight of African logistics on her shoulders. I prod and poke for what her first announcement will be. Convivial but coy, she only volunteers a general sign: \u201cwatch this space.\u201d",

          "text": "Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa, has raised $6.5m in a Series B round led by Partech from its Africa Fund.\n\nThe startup was founded in 2016 when Ihad Fikry and Ibrahim Kamel decided there was a need to cater to the learning needs in the MENA region that were not provided by other platforms.\n\n\u201cWe live in a region with a population of 400 million-plus people but 90% of them cannot learn properly in any other language but Arabic,\u201d Ihab Fikry, Almentor\u2019s co-founder and CEO, says to TechCabal.\n\nThe courses are designed to provide knowledge \u201cin a proper manner without promoting any ideology or religious thoughts,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHow Almentor works\n\nFrom gamified mobile apps to websites that enable streaming, online learning comes in different varieties across the world.\n\nHundreds of educational channels like TED-Ed, Khan Academy and Crash Course have carved a niche on YouTube, without having to build their own technologies. Where does Almentor fit in this universe?\n\nAlmentor can be accessed in multiple countries across Africa but the content is focused on North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nFikry describes Almentor as sharing the attributes of renowned platforms like Masterclass, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning.\n\nIt charges users a subscription to access its library of 12,000 videos.\n\nThe platform has a video-on-demand component that enables learners to stream content, while a learning management system engages users in classroom-like activities like asking and answering questions, and taking exams.\n\nAlmentor can be accessed anywhere, even in Nigeria, but the focus is to serve the Arabic region.\n\nTheir library includes math, history, natural sciences and training material for corporations. For social sciences where context may vary between countries, creators are selected from various countries to ensure the material is relevant. However, many users can find similarities because virtually every course is available in Arabic.\n\nAlmentor works with subject-matter teachers and professional content creators around the MENA region to create the courses. The company and the creators share revenue from subscriptions based on an agreement on exclusivity and whole ownership of the content by Almentor.\n\nFikry says they have received over 3,000 applications from people who want to create course material on Almentor, but the acceptance rate is currently at 12%. Besides welcoming applications, the startup proactively headhunts already successful lecturers and also engages agencies to recruit mentors for them.\n\nSo far, Almentor has provided 2 million successful learning experiences to users. Fikry explains this metric means the learner has consumed at least 25% of the learning material.\n\nLearning categories vary from basic (30% of their library) to intermediate and advanced levels.\n\nA typical Almentor learner is between ages 18 and 40 years old. 51% of learners are male while 49% are female. 60% are from Egypt, 25% are from Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain. The rest come from Algeria, Morocco, Niger and Arabs living in the US and UK.\n\nIn terms of socioeconomic status, Fikry says Almentor learners are between the middle and upper class.\n\n\u201cFor those in Class A+, they prefer to learn in English though some learn in French. For others, almost 40% can only learn in Arabic,\u201d Fikry, a PhD holder who used to be a management professor and PWC consultant, explains.\n\nSeed to Series B, driven by partnerships\n\nAs much as it is a service targeted as directly serving consumers, a key element of Almentor\u2019s progress has been over 80 partnerships it has entered with organisations and governments.\n\nOne such partnership is with the Ministry of Education in Egypt for a white-label curriculum targeted at 4.5 million students in grades 7 to 9. They have another with the government in the UAE to upskill entrepreneurs in the region.\n\nRegardless of the country or the partnership, Almentor\u2019s promise is that users will \u201clearn from a subject matter expert without being driven to any ideology,\u201d Fikry insists.\n\nIt is a sophisticated commitment that requires a range of management skills, beyond merely setting up technology for streaming and learning. It also needs capital to achieve its potential, Fikry says, which explains why they have sought out investors to continue to build.\n\nAs with having governments on board, working with VCs \u201cgives credibility to the platform as we are serving an area with lots of dynamics,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHe says they particularly sought out Partech for this round owing to the VC\u2019s global spread of portfolio companies spanning fintech, edtech and other sectors.\n\nWith this Series B, Almentor has now raised $14.5 million.\n\nIt opened the funding gates with a $3.5 million seed fund in 2016. In 2019, Almentor\u2019s $4.5 million Series A was led by Sawari Ventures, an Egyptian firm that closed a $71 million fund in April. Sawari also invested in this Series B round as Sango Capital, a firm based in South Africa.\n\nCyril Collon, general partner at Partech, described Fikry and his co-founder as \u201ctwo fantastic mission-driven entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nHe believes Almentor is the leading platform for self-learning in the Middle East and Africa, and is looking forward to helping the company expand access to \u201con-demand cutting-edge personal learning & developments options.\u201d",

Existing Chipper Cash investors like Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions and 500 Startups participated. One Way Ventures, Tribe Capital, and Brue2 Ventures also joined the round.\n\nChipper Cash enables individuals to transfer money at zero fees between African countries. It also offers Chipper Checkout, a paid service for businesses to receive payments by sharing payment links with customers or integrating a button on a website or app.\n\nBefore now, the startup was present in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. But Ham Serunjogi, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch they have now made their services available in the UK.\n\nThis expansion comes on the heels of a 33% increase in users \u2013 from 3 million in November 2020 to 4 million at present. Within this period, the company introduced new features to its app including virtual VISA cards for online shopping in Nigeria and crypto transactions in South Africa and Uganda.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also launching our US stocks product in Uganda, Nigeria and a few other countries soon,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nThis Series C marks a stunning rise for a three-year-old startup. It was founded in 2018 by Serunjogi, a Ugandan, and Maijid Moujaled, a Ghanaian. Three years later, the pair has steered the company to the top bracket of fintech startups on the continent, at least in terms of the amount of venture capital raised.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nSince May 2019 when they raised $2.4m, the startup\u2019s total funding stands at $152.2m. Serunjogi, the Chipper Cash CEO, declined to be specific about what the startup is now worth.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not getting into our valuation, but we\u2019re probably the most valuable private startup in Africa today after this round,\u201d he said.\n\nMaijid Moujaled (seated) and Ham Serunjogi, Chipper Cash co-founders\n\nIn March this year, Flutterwave \u2013 a private startup in Africa \u2013 raised $170m and explicitly said they were now valued at more than $1bn. Segunjogi\u2019s comment suggests that Chipper Cash may also now be worth over $1bn, even if they have raised $80m less than the Nigerian fintech.\n\nLike Flutterwave, Chipper Cash is headquartered in San Francisco but has over 200 employees working out of Africa and serving African customers. The startup plans to hire up to 100 staff for its expanding operations.",

Also, a research published in 2021 by the Centre for the Study of the Economics of Africa showed that 29,472 deaths were attributable to smoking. It is also pertinent to note that tobacco is the major risk factor for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and is associated with higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and death.\u201d\n\nIrowa said the theme for this year\u2019s celebration, \u2018Commit to Quit\u2019 is apt as WHO has set a target of supporting at least 100 million people worldwide in their attempt to quit the use of tobacco by adopting various initiatives such as digital solutions.\n\nIrowa said the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has keyed into the concept of supporting people in the State in quitting tobacco as WHO\u2019s findings have shown that many tobacco users are willing to quit the habit and therefore need support.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe State Government is ever committed to support the Federal Ministry of Health with the WHO on the roll out of Nigeria Tobacco Control Communication Plan, the toll-free line for tobacco cessation in Nigeria and the WhatsApp cessation service, which will be launched by the Honourable Minister of Health today in Abuja.\n\n\u201cToday as we observe World No Tobacco Day, I call on people of all ages, especially the young, to join the fight against the tobacco epidemic. I encourage youth groups to build a movement for a tobacco free generation.\n\n\u201cI urge our celebrities and influencers to join their voices on tobacco cessation; I call on parents, caregivers and teachers to educate children on the harmful effects of tobacco products and the need to stop for those already using it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that the Government of Edo State will continue to implement comprehensive tobacco policies as outlined in the National and WHO framework convention on Tobacco control to help reduce the morbidity and mortality from tobacco use,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

Now that it is all over, please accept my congratulations.\n\nThe APC Governorship candidate said the party as the opposition party in the state has a duty to ensure that the right things are done always, appealing that Obaseki should kindly consider the pertinent issues of the 14 absentee lawmakers of the Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA).\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to you to kindly consider the pertinent issues of the 14 constituencies, including the two in your local government \u2013 Oredo and the two in your deputy\u2019s local government \u2013 Etsako West, that are presently without representation at the Edo State Assembly. Though the matter is in court, you are in a vantage position to consider an out-of-court settlement of the issue, in the overall interest of our state.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency would also do well to intervene in the issue of elected Local Government Chairmen, Vice-chairmen, Councilors and Supervisory Councillors, who sometime ago, were suspended and removed from office. Our appeal is that you consider paying them their entitlements since it is now late for them to return to their offices. This can also be through the out of court settlement.\u201d\n\n...",

Last night he was murdered in his Minna house,\n\nObioma was appointed head of NECO barely a year ago on May 14, 2020. He hailed from Abia in Nigeria\u2019s Igbo-dominated South-East region.\n\nThe incident came barely a day after Ahmed Gulak, a top politician of the ruling APC, was gunned down in Owerri, raising widespread fears of insecurity.\n\nThe Niger State Police Command has, however, dismissed as untrue, Obioma was murdered by gunmen in his home in Minna, the state capital.\n\nThe police command in a statement on Tuesday in Minna by its Public Relations Officer, Mr. Wasiu Abiodun, said the story is totally false, untrue and a pure element of fake news.\n\nThe statement said \u201cit is important to state categorically that on 31st May, 2021, the Registrar/CEO, National Examinations Council (NECO), Prof. Godswill Obioma, was rushed to National Hospital, Abuja, by his family members where he was later confirmed dead after a brief illness.\u201d",

          "text": "What is the value of a Nigerian life?\n\nWe live daily today in the shadow of terrorists. Our economy is collapsing. Many families cannot afford the price of food. Millions of young men and women have no jobs and have no hope.\n\nOur university students know more about ASUU strikes and long school closures than any skills they need to be competitive in the world of the 21st century.\n\nOnly the rich and powerful can access quality healthcare in our country or abroad as medical tourists, because our health system, like most other systems, is broken. I lost my father, Isaac Moghalu, in December 1998 because he had a stroke but the doctors were on strike, and therefore we could not get him adequate healthcare on time. Soon after we found a private clinic and moved him there, he went into a coma and passed on shortly afterwards. I was heartbroken. Today, 23 years later, not much has changed. Like many, I have suffered personally the effects of bad governance in our country.\n\nWith life in it increasingly nasty, brutish and short, the very idea of Nigeria is now almost meaningless to many Nigerians. Cries for self-determination fill the air in response to fundamental injustice. Meanwhile, politics in Nigeria does not bring change, and its benefits go to only one group \u2014 the political elite. Their message is loud and clear: we the people \u2014 you and I \u2014 DO NOT matter.\n\nThe bodies of Nigerians are buried in cold corners of foreign cemeteries, strewn across the Sahara desert, and float in the Mediterranean Sea as a consequence of a non-existent leadership. Our country can no longer speak confidently in the gathering of nations. Life as ordained by our Creator, that we may experience His Goodness in this land of the living, has eluded us as a people.\n\nOnly the emergence of visionary, competent and inclusive national leadership, on the one hand, and a fundamental restructuring of Nigeria based on a new people\u2019s constitution, on the other, can arrest Nigeria\u2019s ongoing disorderly and violent degeneration into a completely failed state. We were not born to be miserable and to die miserable. Enough is Enough!\n\nIt is now more than ever necessary that we elect in 2023 a leader who is TRULY committed and has the capacity to initiate the constitutional restructuring of Nigeria.A leader who is competent to secure our lives and property, successfully manage our diversity, save our economy, and restore our international respect.\n\nFor the sake of the youth of our country\u2014including my four children\u2014whose future is being drowned in reckless foreign borrowing, and for the sake of all Nigerians suffering and seeking a clear alternative to the status quo, I intend, with all humility, to present myself\u2014again\u2014as a candidate for the Office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections.\n\nIf elected, I will run a government with a dream team of highly competent Nigerians from all parts of our country. Along with strengthened, independent institutions, we will deliver results on a 4-point agenda in four years (4 by 4):\n\n*Security for all Nigerians and Nigeria\u2019s territory\n\n*War against poverty: skills, jobs for our youth, and an innovation economy\n\n*Accelerated education and healthcare reform\n\n*Good Governance: Inclusive, transparent, effective and accountable.\n\nThis is my SWAG Agenda for a 21st century Nigeria. I seek the support of all compatriots\u2014of everyone who is tired of our present national situation. We also need the energy and support of the youth, the middle class, entrepreneurs, and our compatriots in the diaspora. These important segments of our population have in the past been reluctant to engage actively in our electoral process, ostensibly because of the flaws in that process.\n\nThe National Assembly must now pass into law, with no further delay, necessary electoral reforms that will make democracy yield real dividends for Nigerians.Our votes must count and be counted transparently. The amendments should include a provision for Diaspora Nigerians to be able to register and vote in all elections in Nigeria from abroad.\n\nI am only one face of a movement. A movement of silent and suffering Nigerians fed up with the insecurity, poverty, and a seemingly hopeless future for our country. A movement that has decided that Enough is Enough. That movement, soon to be present in our numbers in every voting ward in Nigeria, will announce within the next few months the political party we will join enmasse and seek its platform for the presidential, legislative and gubernatorial roles in governance.\n\nWe can do this. We can change Nigeria.\n\nTogether, let us walk this road to a Nigeria that, within 30 years of successive administrations, will have achieved the kind of economic and technological advancement attained by countries such as Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates within similar timeframes. It is possible. We only need to participate actively in the democratic process and vote right when the time comes.\n\nWe the Nigerian people matter. We the Nigerian people deserve better. Let\u2019s do this. Because we can and we must.",

          "title": "Tension Heightens In Abuja Community Over Demolition Threat",
          "text": "Residents of Ushafa community in Bwari Area Council of Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, have raised the alarm over the FCT Water Board and some estate developers\u2019 alleged connivance and effort to convince the FCT Minister to demolish the community.\n\nA 72-year-old resident, elder Mathew Danladi told our reporter that Ushafa community which has existed with relative peace for over 200 years has recently been under threats of demolition by the FCT Water Board and its collaborators, thereby heightening tension among residents.\n\nNarrating the beginning of the threat, Danladi said, \u201cThe demolition threat first came up in 2018 when the management of the Usman Dam situated in the community showed up, approaching the community to set aside about 200 meters away from the Dam but was resisted by the indigenes. Also, in 2019, a similar attempt was made but this time around, Development Control Department of FCTA was invited to mark houses built within the said parameters which were also resisted by the indigenes since the authority had already marked out the Dam\u2019s restricted area with iron wire and signposts.\n\n\u201cThe most shocking move came up in March this year (2021) when the Water Board authority stormed the community with virtually representatives of all departments and agencies under FCTA. This time around, the officials stated that they had gotten ministerial approval to implement 500 meters away from the Dam which is almost half of Ushafa community. The situation nearly caused violent attacks if not for the presence of security operatives who calmed the residents.\u201d\n\nOur reporter learnt that when asked what the land would be used for if the demolition exercise was carried out, some of the FCTA officials who did not want their names mentioned because they were not authorised to do so, said they wanted to maintain world standard and to make the place green area while others said it was for safety purpose in case water overflows or when the dam collapses. Another group said it would be used for recreational center for revenue generation.\n\nIt was learnt that the Bwari Area Council chairman, Hon John Gabaya, also resisted the proposal, stressing that revenue generation cannot be prioritised against human lives and property.\n\nBased on the development, series of meetings of stakeholders of FCT Water Board, Ushafa community, Bwari Area Council and other agencies of government and traditional rulers have been taking place in order to find a common ground for amicable settlement in the interest of peace but no conclusion has been reached yet as the dialogue was still ongoing.\n\nHowever, another indigene and community leader, Thomas Musa, told our correspondent that while the negotiation is ongoing, Water Board in desperate effort to convince government to displace the residents from their fatherland had allegedly written different negative reports against the community on their alleged illegal activities around the Dam. He lamented that absolutely nothing is true about what they cited in the reports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his words, \u201cAmong other things it was alleged that the residents are contaminating the water with refuse, human dead bodies, cult initiation, etc but these are not true. Ironically, the water is barricaded with an iron fence and the entrance gate is manned by operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). How could that be possible?\n\n\u201cThe most recent of these desperate moves to destroy our lives and fortunes or displace us in the face of the state of the nation in Nigeria today is a sponsored Newspapers publication with the caption, \u201cUsuma Dam: Abuja Water Source Faces Contamination Threat,\u201d on Saturday, May 28, 2021, by an estate developer and their accomplices. It was desperately alleged in the report that the farm owners were duly compensated and relocated to Peyi among other things. The report shows that the reporters and their sponsors have no information about the location of the Dam in Ushafa,\u201d Musa lamented.\n\nThe FCT Water Board acting general manager, Dame Joy Okoro, had earlier said in a publication that, \u201cas far as I know, I do not know about any attempt to grab land. Our dispute with the people of the village is an encroachment on the waterway (downstream). We have given them notice not to encroach. We have not asked the entire village to leave, rather stop all erection and demolition order has been issued on houses built on the waterway.\u201d\n\nHowever, the residents denied the claim by the Acting General Manager that some people built on the waterway, saying there is no waterway in Ushafa, let alone encroaching on it. The residents also disagreed with Okoro\u2019s position that a demolition order has been issued on houses built on the waterway as the Board is still dialoguing with other stakeholders on the meters to be restricted from the Dam, even when a restriction signposts are already where they should be.\n\nThe residents further debunked what they called \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d in the various reports to the Honourable Minister, Mohammed Musa Bello against them and also appealed to the minister to disregard those reports, saying Usman Dam in Ushafa is very safe for drinking and there is no threat whatsoever from anywhere to the water.\n\nThe indigenes said that the Water Board authority ought to be thinking of extending social responsibility to Ushafa as their host community instead of being a threat to its existence, noting that they have no other place to go and can\u2019t afford to lose all their lifetime achievements.",

          "title": "Kwara people have enjoyed 2 years of freedom under Gov. Abdulrazaq\u2019s leadership \u2013 APC chieftain",
          "text": "By Tunde Opalana\n\nA chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State, Asiwaju Tajudeen Abioye has congratulated the people of Kwara State for having a new lease of life under the administration of governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrasaq in the past 730 days.\n\nHe said with huge dividends of democracy and human development policies and programmes of the Abdulrazaq\u2019s government, Kwarans are reaping the benefits of Otoge revolution through which they ensure a change of government in Kwara State.\n\nWhile appreciating the unprecedented simplicity style of Mallam Abdulrahaman Abdulrasaq as the Governor of this state, he commended the governor for achieving so much within a short period of two years in the areas of infrastructural renewal, innovation, security, intergovernmental relationship, economic and political developments.\n\nHon. Abioye, a former member of the Kwara State House of Assembly in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja on Tuesday said Governor Abdulrazaq inherited a state in a comatose condition with myriad of problems, raging from battered economy, insecurity, unemployment and unimpressive half and quarter salaries to the civil servants and decayed infrastructures facilities all over the state.\n\nHe said the people of Kwara will not forget how the governor and his cabinet commenced rebuilding the state by sacrificing heavily, in terms of personal benefits, entitlements and privileges, and using the minimum resources to govern the state.\n\n\u201cHis approach to governance was not for vendetta but to serve, hence he displayed high level of maturity to handle the fragile peace in the state. In spite the gross misconduct everywhere, the Governor decided handle the impunity he met with utmost caution and care.\n\n\u201cThe strong tolerance level this Government exhibits in continuing all the abandoned projects of the past administrations without changing the contractors was second to none. The Government shows unprecedented understanding of continuity in government. This is contrary to what the state witnessed when Gov. Bukola Saraki took over from Gov. Lawal in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe Abdulrahaman led administration handles security situation with high sense of responsibility and professionalism. For two years running. the administration has been rated high in security management. This is a departure from the era of mass killings in the name of armed robbery, the era when the rituals killings dominated the state. This government has been prompt to curtain any security challenges in the state since inception.\n\n\u201cWe have been witnessing infrastructural revolution in the state, and this cut across all the length and breath of the entire state, this is also unprecedented. The serious national economic crisis and Covid 19 induced economic hardship not withstanding.\n\n\u201cWhen many states in the country are finding it difficult to pay workers salaries, this government is not only paying full salaries, but pays before every month end. The government also embarked on mass recruitment of teachers and civil servants that has been adjudge the best and most transparent in the history of the state in the last four decades. .\n\n\u201cThe magic talent of this administration came to fore, when infrastructural facilities were springing up in every corners of the state. This is marvelous!\n\n\u201cBefore the assumption of the new administration, Kwara State had been blacklisted by many federal government agencies for her inabilities to fulfill her obligations to various organs of government that would in turn bring more dividends of democracy to our people.\n\n\u201cBut, Governor Abdulrahaman was able to cut cost of governance which gave him good opportunities to paid up all the outstanding debts and balances to various organs of Federal Government. As a result of this, our state has returned to the comity of responsible states in the nation\u201d, said Abioye..\n\nHe added that the Otoge struggle that brought this government to power was symbolic and came with a lot of changes and challenges. The hopes were high and expectations were abound.\n\nHe said \u201ctoday, we now have a state that is free for all, the state where every individual has a voice, a state where civil servants opinions matters, the state where traditional institution is referred, a state where gender balancing is hallmarked, a state where politicians now has freedom of association and can sought and get patronage at the federal level with or without the state Governor\u2019s consent and support.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Asks Senate To Confirm New COAS, Maj. Gen. Yahaya\n\n\u201cA state where once such benefits particularly, interns of political appointment materialised, the state government will be the first to congratulate such. Incredible!\u201d\n\nWhile calling on all indigenes of the state irrespective of party leanings to support Governor Abdulrazaq to achieve more success, he charged members of the ruling APC in the state to close ranks and end all political misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we have all laboured and sacrificed to arrive at this pleasant junction, this is the very best time to fly the kite of unity together. The unity of purpose in order to consolidate our achievement.\n\n\u201cThis is the time all hands must be on deck to strengthen on our gains. I therefore appeal to His Excellency, Mal. Abdulrahaman Abdulrasaq, as the leader, not only for the APC in Kwara, but leader and father of all Kwarans, to please not foreclosed the the reconciliation with any group in the state,\u201d he appealed.",

Paschal Oluchukwu, expressed disappointment that \u201cdespite earlier signs and premeditations including an alleged audio voice note widely circulated on the Social media which alerted on the plan to launch a fresh offensive on our defenseless citizens, the Ebonyi State government took no action to protect and defend the victims of this recent onslaught.\n\n\u201cWe are greatly pained that helpless and hapless women, children and youths were cut in their prime in a dastard carnage that spanned for some hours while their victims were deep in their sleep.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, medical and health-care workers in various parts of the State are offering treatments to scores of victims who sustained varying degrees of injuries during the attack. They have also been calls for ebullient citizens to provide clothing and other essential materials to the victims many of who are stranded in the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, AE-FUTHA, Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cOur anxiety over this sadly depressing attacks is made worse by the fact that the State\u2019s Chief Security Officer, Engr. David Umahi on whose shoulders hugely lie the constitutional burden of protection of lives and properties of our beloved citizens has largely down-played all sensible and reasonable warnings about the activities of killer herdsmen.\n\nWhile condemning the massacre in Ebonyi communities, the group decried and questioned the conducts and activities of the men operating under the EbubeAgu Security network, saying \u201cthe outfit has remained what we had feared- a deliberate, willful and willing tool in the hands of the state government to hunt down, hound and maim members of the opposition- PDP and other voices.\n\n\u201cRather than seek practical and viable solutions that can quell the growing unrests and attacks on our people, AESID wishes to reiterate that Umahi is so deeply stuck in his 2023 politics that he is rather empowering and emboldening the \u2018bad guys\u2019 to attack and kill those he considers his opponents.\n\n\u201cThis group consequently condemn the claim that the attack took place in Benue State and the attempt by the State government to further downplay or trivialize not only the latest attack on Izhi communities but the entire security affairs in our dear State.\n\nThe silence of the Speaker and political class in Izhi land, nay Ebonyi State and their inability to condemn these attack including the desperation of Umahi and his cahoots in security circles to always exonerate the provocative Fulani herdsmen from blames where and whenever they occur in Ebonyi demands thorough probe by International security bodies.\u201d\n\nThe governor was therefore asked to change his security tactics by being proactive and seeking help on how to end the carnage in the state.\n\n\u201cUnless perhaps he changes style and strategy on his current grandstanding and unbridled politicization of the security of lives and property of our people, AESID will continue to dump the blames of the killings of our people by marauding herders on the doorsteps of the Governor just as he continues to pay more attention and interest to his shadow-chasing 2023 political projections and campaigns!\u201d, said AESID",

With this, and the attendant threats of extermination from a section of the country, Ojukwu worked fervently for peace; yet he prepared for war. He gathered Biafrans, both military and civilians, to help him in administration and legislation. Igbos answered with one voice and rallied round him like antibodies gathering to attack an infection.\n\nIgbo is one of the most distinctive and important of all African tribes. They are probably the healthiest and strongest and most exuberant people in Nigeria. They show great physical stamina, magnificent courage in the bearing of hardship and pain, an adaptability that enables them to prosper in almost every zone. Sometimes they are called \u201cThe Jews of Africa.\u201d Igbos are individualistic, but know how to organize. They are peace-loving and hospitable by nature. They take the war part when freedom and justice are threatened.\n\nIn Igboland, every able-bodied male is a warrior. They are competitive beings, who stimulate one another through healthy rivalry. They have no other government than that of each family by its head. In the event of strife (as in the civil war), they choose their bravest warrior to lead them, and obey him strictly. But once the conflict ends, they literally send him about his business.\n\nIn Igboland salutation is cordial but simple. There is no bowing, genuflection or prostration, for that seems to the proud citizens a vestige of monarchy. The ability of the Igbos to recover from misfortune is one of the impressive wonders of history, part of that heroic resilience which men in general have shown after the catastrophies of life. Besides, Igbos are superbly intelligent and capable of innovative thoughts and endowed with imaginative and aesthetic sense.\n\nWith these mixed qualities, admirable and frightening, a genius would find it most difficult to lead them. Ojukwu knows Igbo psychology and, consequently, persuaded and showed them what was to be done. Sometimes, he urged and pressed them forward and made them submit to what was to their advantage. He was tenacious of purpose and served Ndigbo with devotion, with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength. He committed himself to the most advanced measures of the war, and seemed never to have betrayed any of its vital principles.\n\nOjukwu\u2019s every move in Nigeria/Biafra war won him a lot of admiration from both friends and foes. The mere fact that for the first time, a Nigerian was singularly able to hold back Nigeria, the giant of Africa, for three years in a conventional warfare without being captured was astounding. Anthony Obi captures it thus: \u201cThe headlong assault of one man against the giant has captured the sensation of the people. It was among the most heroic deeds in Nigerian history.\u201d39 This seemed enough to make him a hero and justified his military attributes more than what we have today as military men. One remarkable fact about him is that he projects a soldier in everything he does, in his movement, his speeches and even in his jokes.\n\nIn the absence of the much-needed weapons, he made his inspirational speeches his chief strategy. No other crusader in Nigeria has equalled him in clarity or force or style, in directness and pungency of phrases, in serious\u00ad \u2013 sometimes hilarious \u2013 similes, in a vocabulary rooted in the speech of the people, and congenial to struggling minds.\n\nMorale, he knew, wins half of the war. His long beard, half bald, facial movement that quickly reflected, if he wished, each turn of feeling or idea, made him look like a comic character to some persons. His ferocious temper, which he kept in check, his large brown eyes which sometimes appear to give off electric sparks, with a mind as penetrating as a sub-machine gun, and fiery words seemed to hypnotize those who listened to him. His speeches, given in a high pitched voice was sometimes so absorbing that one wished it would never end. One of the Biafran soldiers, when asked which of Ojukwu\u2019s speeches he liked best, voiced in two words the feeling of the Igbos and the world when he answered, \u201cThe longest.\u201d\n\nHistory tells us that Alexander the Great helped to introduce into Europe the custom of shaving the beard, on the ground that whiskers offered too ready a handle for an enemy to grasp. But Ojukwu kept his beard. It grew so long that long beards became fashionable in Nigeria. He only wore his beard as a sign of protest against the inhumanity towards Biafrans. It, however, served other purposes. Even the newest recruits in the Biafran Army, who had not seen him for the first time, where able to recognise his presence in their training camps or war fronts unannounced.\n\nOjukwu\u2019s knowledge of any subject he chose to discuss was always amazingly encyclopaedic and largely accurate. He poured in a torrent of words. His vision was enormous. The world rallied round him for quotable quotes. In the words of Nosa Igiebor, \u201cOjukwu is the intrepid man of Biafra, around whom the world media prowled in the late 60s for quotable quotes.\u201d40\n\nIf you read the history of Greece thoroughly, you will discover that their heroes are not saints, or artists, or millionaires, but those who fought for her freedom and her sages. Her most honoured sages were not theorists but men who had made their wisdom function actively in the world. The sayings of these men became proverbial among the Greeks, and were in some cases inscribed in the temple of Apollo at Delphi. People liked to quote, for example, the remarks of Bias: \u201cThe most unfortunate of men is he who has not learned how to bear misfortune,\u201d and that \u201cWisdom should be cherished as a means of travelling from youth to old age, for it is more lasting than any other possession.\u201d41 They seemed to posses amazing knowledge of the world and amazing memories.\n\nIn his own case, Ojukwu\u2019s wealth of information comes from his phenomenal memory, without parallel in Nigeria. His comments about life show evidence of deep reflection. Reading through a speech once, he could immediately grasp the substance of the speech. He used Gowon\u2019s statements and beliefs to whip him and was able to win considerable support from the world that seemed apathetic to the black man\u2019s success. He wanted Gowon to explain what he meant by the statement he made in his maiden broadcast. Gowon said:\n\nPutting all considerations to test \u2013 political, economic, as well as social, the basis for unity is not there or is so badly rocked, not only once but several times. Therefore I feel that we should review the question of our national standing and see if we can stop the country from drifting away into utter destruction.42\n\nThe statement is as explicit and valid today as it was in the sixties, though Gowon denied its meaning when he was further manipulated like a pawn in the chess board by the imperialists, notably, Britain. Till today, some might still argue that the basis for unity does not exist, because each of the groupings that make up Nigeria is sovereign in the real sense of the word. Until the various sovereignties are prepared to negotiate freely in order to obtain a superior Nigerian sovereignty, the question of unity will always remain wishful thinking.\n\nFollowing these, and other controversies of the time, Gowon dismissed Ojukwu from the Nigeria Army, even as his colleagues were promoted to the rank of Brigadier Generals with Gowon himself assuming the rank of a Major General. Thus, Generalship, the rank that used to be a reward of experience and hard work in military circles, became politicised and reduced to a mere title. Through coups and counter coups, it has been further ridiculed and divested of prestige, dignity and influence. The voice of Biafra was characteristically impertinent and resentful of Gowon\u2019s action and answered him in the abusive manner of those polemic days. It said: \u201cAmbitious Gowon, not even ranking seventh in line of promotion in the Nigeria Army, suddenly shot up to the post of a Major General.\u201d43\n\nSome serving and retired members of the Nigeria military called Lt. Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu many things. Some say he is ambitious, others call him arrogant, but none has suggested that he is weak or stupid. They know that he is honest and that not even friendship can turn him aside from what he thinks is right and a course he knows is noble. Despite the conflicting representations of his person, there is one point in which there are no dissenting voices: that had Ojukwu been in Gowon\u2019s position, he would have crushed Biafra in two weeks. All agree that he is a cold-blooded calculator and strategist: brilliant, slippery, and in military term, a first rate brain. Even his most virulent critics concede to him a potent knowledge of the field and an infinite capacity for surprises. In the assessment of the war, the likes of Lt. Colonel Hassan Katsina (later General) said:\n\nIf the Commander-in-Chief, who is a man of the highest integrity, every inch a soldier and who is working hard for the survival of his country, were to give the order, it would take only hours to subdue Lt. Colonel Chukwuemeka Ojukwu and remove the cause of the friction.44\n\nConversely, the Ikemba\u2019s strategy sustained Biafra for three years. Later, Nigeria acknowledged that Ojukwu who was resourceful and knows how to work around problems faced it. What are the peculiar military qualities of this soldiers\u2019 soldier?\n\nOjukwu is an expert in tactics. He taught tactics to most of the Generals that fought him; therefore he knew the workings of their minds. In his training, he learnt to keep himself fit in any weather or place, to think clearly at any hour or day, or night; to distinguish fact from desire, to see terrains as possibilities for the open and hidden movement of men; to anticipate enemy movement and prepare to counter them; to expect the unexpected and meet it unsurprised; to inspire individual souls by addressing them en masse; to anaesthetize pain with glory, and make it sweet and noble to die for one\u2019s country, and for a noble course. Ojukwu had this peculiar character of winning his soldiers\u2019 minds and hearts by being close to them, recalling their heroic struggle against slavery, inquiring about their families, and listening to their complaints.\n\nHis People\u2019s Army loved him so much because he participated physically in the battles and often outdid them in bravery. In Colonel Achuzia\u2019s judgement, his presence in the battlefield was worth twenty thousand men. Achuzia was a Biafran Commander whose courage equalled his piety. Before every battle he prayed like a saint, but in the hour of battle, he was like a lion in his rage. He liked hard work and dangerous enterprises, and could not bear to rest. In a sentence, his resourcefulness represented partly the Biafran ingenuity.\n\nThe final test of a general is in tactics \u2013 the disposition and manoeuvring of his soldiers. Ojukwu trained his soldiers with severe discipline to immediate and precise obedience, to march steadily towards the opposing line without firing a shot till ordered to change direction, and manoeuvre quickly, under fire. Ojukwu took the lead in charging soldiers wherever the battle was toughest. But since the plan of operation, and its quick adjustment to the turn of events, depended upon his continued and concentrated attention, his safety was of prime consideration. But whenever he thought it necessary, he did not hesitate to expose himself. More than seven times we saw men killed at his side. Even when those around him panicked, he always maintained Olympian calm. The reason for these was to incite others to the performance of brave and virtuous actions. Through this strategy he kept the spirit and morale of his soldiers up, even when their fortunes were low. In the face of danger they were all courage.\n\nBeyond inciting his soldiers to perform heroic deeds, Ojukwu subjected himself to widespread deprivation. He reduced his sleep to Buddhist minimum of two to three hours daily. This enabled him undertook in conscientious detail issues relating to the state and war. His first rule in case of unforeseen emergences was to attend to them immediately, at whatever time of the day or night. He left permanent instructions with his aides concerning the two to three hours of sleep that he had. \u201cDo not wake me when you have good news to communicate, with such there is no hurry. But when you bring bad news, rouse me instantly, for then there is not a moment to loose.\u201d45\n\nAs he worked hard, he expected no less from his aides. They were always ready to give him precise up-to-the-hour information in any matter falling within their jurisdiction. He did not consider his day finished until he had read the reports, memoranda and documents that almost daily came to him from war fronts and from the departments of government.\n\nOjukwu\u2019s character harmonizes with that of Alexander the Great, Charles de Gaule, Napoleon Bonaparte, Philip of Macedon and Pericles. Most of all, however, Ojukwu, like Julius Ceasar, is fiercely grandiose and spectacularly courageous. Like Philip of Macedon, he pursues his goals unrelentingly and would not bear to rest. As Napoleon Bonaparte, he possesses a penetrating judgement of men.\n\nAfter the capture of Napoleon, he was able to re-take France without guns and a standing army. The forces sent by the French government to capture him were converted to his side by the sheer power of oratory. Ojukwu, during the war, and till now, could silence opposition by the hypnotic power in words \u2013 spoken words. Martin Odika, a lawyer, spoke eloquently of him:\n\nOjukwu is great, not because he has trodden the rosy and cosy path while on the throne; not because he was not mocked, buffeted or had no thorns inserted into his crown; but because he had many a sleepless night and was near hypertensive in steering the ship of the state (Biafra). He sacrificed his comfort and possessions that we would be comfortable and grappled with near insurmountable difficulties to ensure the security and well being of his people.46\n\nAll in all, Ojukwu\u2019s exploits showed him to be a soldier and a general, not in the least inferior to any of the greatest and most admired commanders who had appeared at the head of armies. Individually, each fought heroically to the limit his arms could carry him. He has what Cato thought a great point in a soldier: not only his strength of hand and stroke, but his voice and look are themselves as terrifying to the enemy as a tomahawk.\n\nOjukwu\u2019s leadership qualities were equally appreciated during the war. Biafra is often likened to a man with a machete that put up a heroic fight against an enemy armed with fighters and tanks. Biafrans withstood the Nigeria assault in the words of Ojukwu, \u201cWith nothing other than our stout hearts and barehands.\u201d47\n\nNotwithstanding being out-gunned, he seemingly agreed with Billy Graham that: \u201cSometimes it becomes necessary to fight the strong in order to protect the weak.\u201d48 Therefore, the war was a revolution within the law \u2013 the keeping of the law when government broke it, the prevention of the total extermination of Ndigbo whom Ojukwu was entrusted to protect. His was the action of a patriot.\n\nThere is no doubt that Ojukwu loves Nigeria as his polity and Ndigbo as part of that polity. His love for his people was demonstrated in the type of leadership he gave them. It will be recalled that he spent all the money he laid his hands on in defence of his people. The one way he was able to acquire his machetes (arms) against bombers and tanks was to mobilize Biafrans painfully for the manufacture of those ammunition, and through personal sacrifice.\n\nWhen Ojukwu\u2019s wealthy father died, he left an estate of many millions of pounds; some of these safely banked in Europe. Ojukwu exhausted all in the purchase of arms. In all he does, he thinks his obligation to Ndigbo stronger and more important than other considerations. Thus, his unalloyed commitments to the Igbos, and his resolve not to be repaid for it, is the reason why any sacrifice by Ndigbo for Ojukwu\u2019s welfare is not only needed, but somehow mandatory.\n\nIt is on record that he received no salary as the Head of State of Biafra. During the war, Igbos looked on him as a messiah. They always shouted at him thus: \u201cPower! Power! Power!\u201d He rebuked them and humbly told them that all his concern was for their freedom; that his name was not \u201cpower\u201d but Emeka. Whilst he was a servant, he said, Biafrans were the masters, the sovereign at the name of whom every knee should bow. In doing this he had unwittingly reconciled with the great writer, William Hazlitt, remembered above all for his essays, which are of permanent value for their humanity. Hazlitt said that the love of liberty was the love of others, while the love of power was the love of ourselves. Ojukwu has always loved liberty and his aims have been as consistent as the Northern star: to speak for the oppressed, carry the cross of the persecuted, and fight for their freedom. In the affirmation of the driving passion of his life, he made a frank confession:\n\nThroughout my life, personal comfort has never been my priority. If it had been, I would not have left my director\u2019s suite in Lagos to go into the bush as a district officer tramping across the Nigerian wilderness on foot and abandoned my luxurious Chevrolet Impala. I would not have left the administrative cadre to enlist as a recruit in the Nigerian Army. I would not have chosen to resist Gowon instead of the easy way of acquiescence chosen by my colleagues.49\n\nMost confessions are camouflage, but there is in this one, like the confession of St. Augustine of Hippo, a sincerity that shocked most people. Nobody doubts the opportunity he forsook for the service of his people. This was the action of a patriot.\n\nOjukwu talks frequently of virtues and practices it. He is stern and obdurate in public. In his private relations he is compassionate and always willing to serve. Throughout his painful but joyous romance with Biafra, he manifested a freedom far superior to corruption, and base consideration of money. When I remember this saying of Thomas Edison: \u201cRemember you are the servant of the public and never let the desire for money or power prevent you from giving to the public the best work of which you are capable,\u201d50 my mind turns to Ojukwu as a living embodiment of the immortal lines. When in a demonstration, a youth was seen carrying the portrait of Ojukwu simply inscribed: \u201cThe incorruptible,\u201d no one seemed to have challenged the term. He is a character deserving our high admiration, not solely for the modesty he showed in all the affairs of his life, but mainly for the feeling and the thought of his people which made him to regard it nobly that, in the period of his statesmanship, he never had gratified his passion through bad conduct.\n\nIn Ojukwu is the true foundation of sovereignty to be seen, a nature born to rule, and a genius to gain obedience. His trial is reminiscent of Demonsthene\u2019s, a statesman recognized as the greatest of Greek orators, who assiduously cultivated his speaking skills. Being a logographer, he persuaded his fellow citizens to pursue not that which seemed more pleasant, easy or profitable. He declared, over and over again, that they ought in the first place to prefer that which was just and honourable before their own preservation. Similarly, Ikemba persuaded his people to rise up and secure freedom and dignity and contribute their own quota to the struggle of the blackman against being relegated as culturally, morally, spiritually, intellectually, and physically inferior to other races. He possessed the people with great hopes, and he himself entertained yet greater, and the utmost bound of his ambition was but mere outset of his expectations.\n\nThe Eze-Igbo Ggurugburu believes in many wise sayings ascribed to Socrates. Of his many quotes, perhaps, the most important and outstanding ones are: \u201cKnow thyself,\u201d and \u201cAn unexamined life is not worth living.\u201d51 The Socratic dictum, \u201cknow thyself\u201d is an ancient wisdom written in about 600 B.C. over the door of an antiquated Greek temple at Delphi. Anyone who went to seek help of this oracle at Delphi was first and foremost given this command: \u201cknow thyself\u201d. For Socrates, the ideal ethos of the good life resides in the knowledge of self, which is philosophically called \u201cself mastery\u201d.\n\nLord Alfred Tennyson, often regarded as the chief representative of the Victorian Age in poetry, beautifully put it this way: \u201cSelf-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control, these three lead life to its sovereign power.\u201d52 According to the ancient Chinese philosopher and founder of Taoism, Lao Tse, \u201cHe who knows others is learned; he who knows himself is wise.\u201d53\n\nThese views of Socrates, Tennyson and Lao Tse were exemplified in the life of the wise Biafran leader. If he had not known himself, if he had not known his course, he would not have been able to withstand (and still withstands) series of campaign unleashed against him by Nigerian politicians. Remember the celebrated case of Villaska Lodge against the Lagos State Government. The case has become a classic in Constitutional Law. Remember the unscrupulous manner in which he was rigged out of victory in the Second Republic, and the manner the victory of his party, All People\u2019s Grand Alliance (APGA) was upturned, especially in Igbo states. Remember his disqualification from contesting for the Presidency for no just cause. All in all, he always receives them with philosophical calmness. At the worst of times, when in the midst of his perils and sufferings, he steals himself with words that the ancient Socrates loved to quote: \u201cBe patient now my soul; thou hast endured still worse than this.\u201d54 The admiring posterity will certainly call him, \u201cOjukwu the Great.\u201d\n\nThe above presentation of the sequence of events clearly shows Biafra as an accident in one sense, and in another, a deliberate human creation involving people in a self-conscious and forced expression of their preference for liberty, self-actualisation and the pursuit of happiness. In the early period of the USA history, a similar situation plunged the entire nation into turmoil and instability. Oriental China would have decreed such a state as having lost the \u201cMandate of Heaven.\u201d The occidental Greeks of old, faced with a similar situation would have fought not only with spears but also with battle-axes. However, Biafrans tried their best to assert their protest against slavery to the best of their abilities. If the Igbos had not defended themselves, what would have happened?\n\nWe do not know and can hardly guess what would have happened if the Nigerian Armed Forces had not been repelled and were left to carry out their programme of extermination. But there are lessons to be learnt from the study of that feared catastrophe which was once so close to fulfilment.\n\nThe Nigerians with their clear-cut pogrom plans, their unruly juggernaut of an army, would have effaced the Igbos from the face of the earth. As if in pursuit of that, the army killed indiscriminately. But it would of course be absurd to expect soldiers to be saints; good killing requires its own unique virtues. Igbos were virtually defenceless, and to all appearances Biafra was doomed. It must have seemed to Gowon and Hassan Katsina only a matter of weeks or months for Biafra to be annihilated. But appearances were deceptive. What saved Biafra was the courage of its people, the charisma of Ojukwu and the conviction that their defence was in their own hands. Before Nigeria would carry out her plans, the world had been alerted on the barbaric intentions of certain elements within the leadership.\n\nThere is no doubt that Ojukwu would have won the war had he fought with Gowon\u2019s type of disposition. Had he agreed to concede some parts of our oil rich territory in return for ammunition. True to character, he showed enough will power, which could not permit our erstwhile colonial masters to push him about like a pawn on a chessboard. Though he lost, one would have personally preferred his position to a phoney victory that is pregnant with question marks anytime the question of \u201cBakassi\u201d and other things come to mind.\n\nOther unsavoury opposition led to the defeat of the revolution, which, despite its shortcomings, still left a powerful impression upon the memory, emotions, aspirations, and the art of the Igbos. The greatest obstacle to the revolution was neither Ojukwu nor the direction and contents of the revolution, but the antics of Western Nigeria. It would be recalled that on May 1, 1967, the region\u2019s most prominent politician and leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, told a major gathering of Yoruba elite that \u201cIf the Eastern region by acts of omission or commission secedes from or opts out of Nigeria, then the Western region and Lagos must also stay out of the Federation.\u201d55 Responding to Awolowo\u2019s remark, \u201cThe Western Leaders of Thought\u201d, the most representative body of Yoruba opinion then in existence, passed a resolution declaring that \u201cIf any region seceded, the federation as we know it shall cease to exist,\u201d and that \u201cWestern Nigeria shall automatically become independent and sovereign.\u201d56\n\nAs the crisis raged, Chief Awolowo categorically ruled out the use of coercion, but when later the East was forced out, nobody knew what prevented the West from fulfilling its promise. Regrettably, Chief Obafemi Awolowo joined the succession of men whom Gowon gravely addressed as his Ministers. In the course of the war, Awolowo had reason to say: \u201cAll is fair in war, and starvation is one of the weapons of war. We should not feed our enemies fat in order to fight us harder.\u201d57 When first I heard these words, I wanted to cry. The word is BETRAYAL. The Western leaders compromised their stand with posts in the Federal Cabinet, including the Finance Ministry.\n\nIt is also pertinent to point out that when Ojukwu had given a Yoruba, Lt. Colonel Victor Banjo, the command of the liberating Biafran Army, the appointment was in the hope of placating non-Igbos in the Midwest and facilitating a link up with Western Nigeria. According to Ojukwu, it was to signify an East/West disposition not only for himself, but also for the Biafran people for solidarity in the Nigerian crisis. This he presently calls \u201cThe handshake across the Niger.\u201d But Lt. Colonel Banjo behaved in a way most unbecoming of a patriotic Biafran officer. Once in control of Benin, with the chasing away of Lt. Colonel Ejoor, Lt. Colonel Banjo announced that the Midwest would be independent of both Nigeria and Biafra, but first he would liberate Lagos and Western Nigeria from Northern domination. He was too talkative, too undisciplined, and had delayed fretfully to capture Lagos according to instructions. If that were done, the face of the war would have automatically changed.\n\nWhen Ojukwu got wind of Banjo\u2019s disloyalty, he by-passed him and sent a direct order to major Akagha, commanding the Point Battalion to push on to the West. There was still time. Akagha attacked on 16 August at the Ofosu river bridge, the border with the west. He broke the defences there and observed that the Nigerian troops were from Gowon\u2019s own personal bodyguard, the absolute last reserves. These men fled after the fight, and Akagha moved on. The small town of Ore was reached on 20 August and another fight took place. Again, the Dodan Barracks guards were defeated, losing fifty dead and the rest fleeing into the bush. The road was open; there was not a fighting man between Ore and Carter Bridge.\n\nThe attendant panic caused by Akagha\u2019s bravery could not be sustained because, Banjo, fearing his plans truncated, sent a squad to arrest him. Confused, Akagha left his command and went into hiding.\n\nOjukwu later contended that his single greatest mistake of the war was not to have rushed personally to Benin with his best battalion, remove Banjo and then head straight for Lagos. Suddenly when Biafran forces retreated to Onitsha, their Igbo brothers at Asaba and Agbor who could have shown solidarity in what had by then reduced to an Igbo affair, by organizing guerrilla warfare, denied their Igboness. It was tragic.\n\nThe Eastern minorities were another people who could not appreciate the taste of freedom in a war that was partly intended to free them. Had these small ethnic groups in the riverine areas, noted for their culinary skills, resisted the federal forces either directly or through aid and comfort to Biafran guerrillas, the resistance might have succeeded.\n\nThere, we let the golden flashes of opportunity slip by, the greatest opportunity of establishing a truly black independence that would have endured. This missed opportunity manifests today in the incessant cry of marginalization, exploitation, environmental degradation, endless offshore/onshore debates, the issue of littoral states, and fear of ethnic domination. Had the struggle succeeded, the issues that led to the death of Mr. Ken Saro Wiwa would not have arisen.\n\nMost importantly and often the most regretted factor were the oppositions from within: the sheer pressure of another opposing polity led by an Igbo son, Chief Ukpabi Asika. Asika refused to align with his people in the defence against a common enemy. While Ojukwu called the Igbos to protect their rights, Asika was mad in love with the enemy. It was either that he believed in forgiveness and did not recognize self-defence as a virtue or he was gratified by privileges appertaining to his office.\n\nIt was for the sake of such people that the former Israeli Prime Minister, Menachem Begin said: \u201cIf you love freedom, you must hate slavery; if you love your people, you cannot but hate the enemies that compass their destruction.\u201c58 From all indications, Asika did not love his people. At once, he mounted a counter campaign and talked in terms of things being alright in Biafra, even when kwashiorkor ravanged the land and claimed many children as one of its culprits. If Biafra had succeeded, people like him would have been tried for treasonable offences.\n\nFor the sake of objectivity, one is forced to remember the role of the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, upon hearing, which any ear, including those of non-Igbos, will tingle. Ojukwu grew in the lap of Zik. Ojukwu\u2019s Father, single-handed, financed Zik\u2019s politics until he died, Ojukwu\u2019s father stood by Zik in the moment of trial. Ojukwu himself had known Zik as a rare synthesis of ability and integrity. When he emerged during the spring of 1968, he was entrusted with the delicate task of diplomacy.\n\nZik led a delegation of well-known Igbos on a tour of African capitals in search of recognition. He composed the Biafran anthem, and associated himself with Biafra\u2019s just cause. The same Zik vehemently denied Biafra at the time she needed him most: her trying times. He defected to the federal side and with a flurry of moves and interviews, shared in the betrayal of a child he ought to be proud of his paternity. This made the Igbos who held him in the highest esteem to (painfully) regard him as a traitor. They charged him with having led them to the brink, inspired them to jump, and ran away. In one of Zik\u2019s caustic effusions, he thundered:\n\nI was never a member of the Biafran Executive Council or its Civil Service or statutory bodies or its establishment. I was never consulted before any official policy is formulated or implemented, but occasionally, I was ordered to do certain things. For example, proceed on a mission abroad; join the delegation to Niamey and Addis Ababa. Of course, I had Hubson\u2019s choice. In some cases, I had to read prepared statements, but by and large I always acted under duress.59\n\nI often wonder how the young Igbos would react when they read the exploits of the great Zik and juxtapose it with such statements concerning his own kind. Late Pa Awolowo, who by all standards was pa Zik\u2019s political rival, must have laughed at Zik during those tense days. The statement was a total confession of indifference and a denial of oneself. It is for posterity to judge \u2013 it has started judging.\n\nNevertheless, in the face of the above overwhelming odds, Ojukwu did not surrender but continued to resist federal injustices. The world was surprised by his steadfastness. People just wondered what he thought he was doing. J.F. Donceel was the one who answered them vividly when he said: \u201cThe test of will power is not found in the decisions the individual takes or in the eagerness with which he sets to work, but in the way he behaves when obstacles and other difficulties present themselves in his path.\u201d60 On Ojukwu\u2019s part, how did he behave when faced with Donceelian obstacles? Simple, he was unshakable in his choice, because the choice was founded upon knowledge and wise reasoning and could not be changed by disappointment, or suffer as to repent.\n\nThroughout the crisis, Ojukwu was not averse to dialogue. With open heart, he or his delegates attended several peace conferences at Kampala, Addis Ababa and other places. In those conferences, he sustained his oriental subtlety that negotiations and strategy requires. He knew the facts to present and those to be kept in the interest of strategy. Once he was asked what his plans were for the day, he answered, \u201cIf a hair in my beard knew, I would pluck it out.\u201d61\n\nWhen he left Biafra for Ivory Coast, it was to consult with Biafran friends and work out modalities for peace. Accordingly, he ordered his Chief of General staff, the late Major General Philip Effiong, who had earned a reputation for authoritative and successful generalship throughout the war, to continue until he comes back. But his soldiers well knew that Ojukwu\u2019s mind and will had been half their might, became panicky and Effiong surrendered. One of the Biafran soldiers who held on till the surrender explains the reason thus:\n\nBut the strength of a ruler is often the weakness of his government. Biafran government depended so much upon Ojukwu\u2019s superior qualities of mind and character that obviously it would threaten to disintegrate at his absence.62\n\nIn the ecstasy of victory, Nigerian soldiers broke into Ojukwu\u2019s bedroom. What they saw surprised them \u2013 a copy of the Aburi Accord tied to Ahiara Declaration and an automatic rifle as if to signify the goal and the instrument.\n\nImmediately after the collapse, everybody tried to disassociate himself from Ojukwu and from Biafra. Ojukwu learnt of all these, but did not loose himself. Other great men suffered the same fate in the past. After the debacle at the \u201cBay of Pigs,\u201d John F. Kennedy was similarly isolated. In his own reaction, Kennedy said: \u201cThere is an old saying that victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan.\u201d63\n\nThe story of Tinom of Athen also illustrates the fate of men when divorced from fortune. Receptive, flattering friends surrounded Tinom, an Athenian billionaire. When he lost his money, all his friends vanished overnight. He kicked the dust of civilization from his feet and retired to forest solitude, where, he hoped, he would find the unkindest beasts kinder than mankind. Suddenly he found gold. Friends appeared again. He drove them off with lashing scorn. With the capture of Biafra, even friends turned against Ojukwu; he became the sole father of Biafra.\n\nThe collapse of Biafra reminds us of the tragedies of Aeschylus, who was the first of great classical tragic dramatists of Athens. The hero was a figure of massive integrity and powerful will, a paradox of outer poise and inner passion who recognized the inevitability of evil, despair, suffering and perhaps loss. Choosing a perilous but noble cause of action despite the counsel of the Greek chorus, he struggled nobly, but vainly against fate. Enduring cruelty and ultimately defeat, his downfall being the consequence of a fatal deficit in the characters of his colleagues, which deepened by tumultuous events, eventually shattered him.\n\nSo it was with our own Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu: brave, brilliant and majestic. He was a colossus that bestrode Nigeria until the wicked seemed to have triumphed. Was this seemingly triumph not a transient victory of evil?\n\nCulled from my biography of Ojukwu entitled \u201cOjukwu: The Last Patriot\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "THE attack carried out by suspected herdsmen in the boundary area of Ebonyi/Benue last Sunday affected seven vilages of Ndigwe, Ataloga, Odokem, Ekile, Nduobasi,, Ekpufu and Obakota, Vanguard can authoritatively report. The attack led to the death of over 30 indigenes of Ebonyi while some survivors are still receiving treatment at the Alex-Ekweme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki.\n\nIn a statement, the Executive Chairman of Ado Local Government Area of Benue State, Chief James Oche said \u201cOperation Whirlstroke Military Outfit after we reached out to them, helped salvage the ensuing massacre by repelling the attacks and forcing the assailants to withdraw.\u201d According to the Statement: \u201cIn the early hours of Sunday, May 30, 2021, herdsmen in their numbers concomitantly attacked several Igbo speaking communities of Ado Local Government Area of Benue State. They unleashed an unprecedented degree of terror, killing no fewer than 30 persons as at the time of this release.\n\n\u201cThe communities worst hit by the attack are; Ndigwe village, Ataloga village, Odokem, Ekile village, Nduobasi village, Ekpufu and Obakota villages. The residents of these villages have been completely displaced. While others have lost their lives, many are yet to be found and have remained missing. \u201cIt was the response of the Operation Whirlstroke Military Outfit after we reached out to them that helped salvage the ensuing massacre by repelling the attacks and forcing the assailants to withdraw. \u201cWe condemn in strong terms this attack and wish to say that it is one too many an onslaught on our people and the devastation suffered is better imagined. We have a fresh situation of about 3000 internally displaced persons caused by this attack in addition to the 2000 we had from previous attacks.\n\n\u201cWhile there are insinuations from unsubstantiated sources that the attack was a reprisal for IPOB\u2019s alleged murder of a herdsman, we categorically state with emphasis that, Benue State is not and can never be party to IPOB agitation and attacking our people on IPOB related issues is a thing we will not accept. \u201cIn view of the ensuing murder of our people by these herdsmen, we urge our people to rise up and take all steps as may be necessary to give self defence to themselves, as it would be cowardly to remain arms-folded and be murdered right in our homes. \u201cWe further appreciate and pledge our loyalty to the government of Benue State.\n\nThe Anti-Open Grazing and Ranches Establishment Law of our state stands and we are committed to its enforcement no matter what. We call on the federal government to live up to its responsibility of protecting the lives and property of Nigerians, as the growing insecurity is fast turning the country into the Hobbean state of nature. \u201cWe urge our people not to be discouraged, but to rise up to the task in defence of our fatherland, as we will continue to support in the best way, time and resources would afford us. \u201d\n\nCarrying out an on the spot assessment of the attack on Izzi Community in Benue State, Chief Onyekachi Nwebonyi, Commissioner for Capital City Development, Ebonyi State, described the attack as barbaric and savage and enjoined the people to remain calm but vigilant. He described as worrisome, the incessant attacks on unarmed and defenceless citizens by marauding herdsmen while the federal government keeps aloof. He stated that Ebonyi State government under Governor David Umahi is leaving no stone unturned in making sure that the lives and property of residents of the state are protected.\n\nHe further decried the lackadaisical attitude of the Benue State government and wondered why the Benue State government could not show any concern or action when the people they claim are their own are being massacred and their property destroyed wantonly, even after the carnage. He stated that the incident has clearly shown that Benue State does not accept the people of the area either ethnically or geographically. He said there is a question to answer on why the people of Ado and Oju LGAs of Benue State could allow the attackers free access to attack Izzi people and leave after the incident without any hindrance. The whole thing, he said, smacks of something fishy.\n\nHe however commended the Ebonyi State governor for his quick response and immediate dispatch of relief materials to the affected community. He said the fact that the Governor of Ebonyi State took prompt response and responsibility of the medical treatment of those injured in the attack showed that he recognizes the people as Ebonyians, which they truly are. Other well-meaning Ebonyi stakeholders such as the Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Francis Nwifuru and the Chairman of Ebonyi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Mrs. Chinyere Nwoagbaga have reached out to the victims of the Sunday attack.

Ben Ayade was not respected and honoured by the hierarchy of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) before his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nJonah-Williams on Tuesday in Calabar, said that Ayade\u2019s defection from the PDP to the APC was timely.\n\nThe Speaker, who represent Yakurr II State Constiturncy in the Assembly, said that out of the 25 House of Assembly members in the state, APC has 18, while the PDP has seven.\n\n\u201cBefore the governor took the decision, he consulted widely and majority of the people told him that he needed to move to the APC.\n\n\u201cWhile in PDP, the governor was not respected and given the honour he deserved by the hierarchy of the PDP as the leader of the party in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, there was need for him to move. The Governor has also stated clearly that he needed to align the state with the happenings in the centre for the interest of the state.\n\n\u201cCross River is known for always playing politics with the centre. Since 1999, former Governors Donald Duke and Liyel Imoke all played politics from the centre.\n\n\u201cAyade is the only governor from the state who has played opposition for six years now and he feels it is time to align with the centre for the benefit of the state,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recalled that during the last ward and chapter congresses of PDP in the state, the PDP national had to recognise a list of executive members who did not even contest for the positions at the ward and chapter level.\n\nHe said that such marginalisation of key stakeholders in the state by the PDP also informed their decision to defect with the governor to the APC.\n\n\u201cAs Speaker of Cross River House of Assembly, the ward list from my political ward that I have been winning elections with was neglected and a new list was constituted with members that I do not even know and nobody consulted me,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Speaker, the remaining two years period of Ayade will attract the needed development from the centre into the state.\n\nHe gave assurance that APC will win all the elective positions in the state in the 2023 general elections in view of the governors defection to the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe Superhighway and the Deep Seaport will now be given utmost attention by the Federal Government and other things will also fall in place as well.\n\n\u201cGov. Ayade has spent six years in office, I will advice him to consolidate on the gains of his industrial revolution in the state by completing the projects and privatising them for the future.\n\n\u201cThe House of Assembly wants the industries that were initiated by Gov. Ayade to live beyond this administration.\n\n\u201cOn road infrastructure, I want to specially commend the governor on the construction of the Mfom-Obanliku dual carriageway and the ongoing East-West road in Boki local government area,\u201d he said.",

Millions of young men and women have no jobs and have no hope\n\nOur university students know more about ASUU strikes and long school closures than any skills they need to be competitive in the world of the 21st century.\n\nOnly the rich and powerful can access quality healthcare in our country or abroad as medical tourists, because our health system, like most other systems, is broken. I lost my father, Isaac Moghalu, in December 1998 because he had a stroke but the doctors were on strike, and therefore we could not get him adequate healthcare on time.\n\nSoon after we found a private clinic and moved him there, he went into a coma and passed on shortly afterwards. I was heartbroken. Today, 23 years later, not much has changed. Like many, I have suffered the effects of bad governance in our country.\n\nWith life in it increasingly nasty, brutish and short, the very idea of Nigeria is now almost meaningless to many Nigerians. Cries for self-determination fill the air in response to fundamental injustice.\n\nMeanwhile, politics in Nigeria does not bring change, and its benefits go to only one group \u2013 the political elite. Their message is loud and clear: we the people \u2014you and I \u2013 DO NOT matter.\n\nThe bodies of Nigerians are buried in cold corners of foreign cemeteries, strewn across the Sahara desert, and float in the Mediterranean Sea, as a consequence of a non-existent leadership. Our country can no longer speak confidently in the gathering of nations.\n\nLife as ordained by our Creator, that we may experience His Goodness in this land of the living, has eluded us as a people.\n\nOnly the emergence of visionary, competent and inclusive national leadership, on the one hand, and a fundamental restructuring of Nigeria based on a new people\u2019s constitution, on the other, can arrest Nigeria\u2019s ongoing disorderly and violent degeneration into a completely failed state. We were not born to be miserable and to die miserable. Enough is Enough!\n\nIt is now more than ever necessary that we elect in 2023 a leader who is TRULY committed and has the capacity to initiate the constitutional restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nA leader who is competent to secure our lives and property, successfully manage our diversity, save our economy, and restore our international respect.\n\nFor the sake of the youth of our country \u2014 including my four children \u2014 whose future is being drowned in reckless foreign borrowing, and for the sake of all Nigerians suffering and seeking a clear alternative to the status quo, I intend \u2014 with all humility \u2014 to present myself \u2014 again \u2014 as a candidate for the Office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections.\n\nIf elected, I will run a government with a dream team of highly competent Nigerians from all parts of our country. Along with strengthened, independent institutions, we will deliver results on a 4-point agenda in four years (4 by 4):\n\n\u2014 Security for all Nigerians and Nigeria\u2019s territory;\n\n\u2014 War against poverty: skills, jobs for our youth, and an innovation economy;\n\n\u2014 Accelerated education and healthcare reform;\n\n\u2014 Good governance: inclusive, transparent, effective, and accountable.\n\nThis is my SWAG Agenda for a 21st century Nigeria. I seek the support of all compatriots \u2014 of everyone who is tired of our present national situation. We also need the energy and support of our youth, the middle class, entrepreneurs, and our compatriots in the diaspora.\n\nThese important segments of our population have in the past been reluctant to engage actively in our electoral process, ostensibly because of the flaws in that process.\n\nThe National Assembly @nassnigeriamust now pass into law, without further delay, necessary electoral reforms that will make democracy yield real dividends for Nigerians. Our votes must count, and be counted transparently. The amendments should include a provision for\n\nDiaspora Nigerians to be able to register and vote in all elections in Nigeria from abroad.\n\nI am only one face of a movement. A movement of silent and suffering Nigerians fed up with the insecurity, poverty, and a seemingly hopeless future for our country. A movement that has decided that Enough is Enough.\n\nThat movement, soon to be present in our numbers in every voting ward in Nigeria, will announce within the next few months the political party we will join en masse and seek its platform for the presidential, legislative and gubernatorial roles in governance.\n\nWe can do this. We can change Nigeria.\n\nTogether, let us walk this road to a Nigeria that, within 30 years of successive administrations, will have achieved the kind of economic and technological advancement attained by countries such as Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates within similar timeframes. It is possible. We only need to participate actively in the democratic process, and vote right when the time comes.\n\nWe the Nigerian people matter. We the Nigerian people deserve better. Let\u2019s do this. Because we can and we must.\n\n[Signed]\n\nKingsley Chiedu Moghalu, Ph.D. OON FCIB\n\nIfekaego Nnewi\n\nJune 1, 2021\n\nMoghalu4Nigeria.org\n\nkingsleymoghalu.com\n\n#Ends",

The fake report has again proven that some people are working overtime and hell-bent in tarnishing the good image of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) at all cost. Sadly, it is an effort in futility as the NAF remains focused as it carries out its constitutional role of defending our dear Nation alongside sister Services and other security agencies\u201d.\n\nHe however, reminded reporters that the office of the DOPRI remains open for verification on any NAF-related issues.\n\nEarlier, a leading online news portal in the country reported that \u201cA Nigerian Air Force ATR 42 aircraft heading for Owerri, Imo State, to aid military operations in the South-East region, crash-landed in Akure, the Ondo State capital\u201d.\n\nThe news platform reported that it learnt from top NAF sources that the crash-landing of the ATR 42 occurred about two weeks ago \u2013 a week before the late Chief of the Army Staff, Lt Gen Ibrahim Attahiru, died in a similar NAF jet crash in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cIt was gathered that military authorities covered up the incident and failed to make it public to avoid national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cTop sources released the photograph of the ill-fated ATR 42. The aircraft was conveying some Special Forces personnel to Imo State, some of whom were reportedly injured after the crash.\n\n\u201cBut there was no casualty according to sources, which made it easier for the NAF authorities to be silent on the incident.\n\n\u201cIt was an ATR 42 and we were going to Imo State. The aircraft crashed-landed the next day; the authorities are hiding the incident. The crash occurred in the morning. It was a solely military affair and they prevented anyone of us from taking photographs of the incident.\n\n\u201cIt crash-landed at the Akure airport two weeks ago but they hid it. About 15 to 20 personnel were on board to the South-East,\u201d the story read in part.\n\nIf the report is something to take to bank, then it can be easily said that four NAF platforms crashed in three months.\n\nThese incessant crashes raises fears about the quality of training the pilots received, as well as maintenance culture of the military aircrafts.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), last week, ordered the investigation of its operational, and engineering units to ascertain the factors responsible for the incessant crashes of its aircraft.\n\nThe Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao constituted a Committee of serving and retired senior officers to conduct a safety audit of all Nigerian Air Force(NAF) operational and engineering units.\n\nThe Director of Public Relations and Information Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet in a statement said that the Committee is to, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations in the units.\n\n\u201cThe Committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the committee is chaired by Air Vice Marshal Abraham Adole, the Deputy Theatre Commander, Operation HADIN KAI.\n\nThe statement concluded that the Committee is to submit its report not later than 18 June 2021.\n\nNigerians are keenly waiting for the outcome of the special audit.",

We wish her well.\u201d\n\nThere were also messages of support posted on social media from athletes in other sports, with golf\u2019s Michelle Wie, NFL players Russell Wilson and Tyler Lockett as well as multiple Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt offering their backing.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ever have to make a decision like this \u2014 but so damn impressive taking the high road when the powers that be don\u2019t protect their own. Major respect,\u201d wrote NBA All Star Steph Curry.\n\nThere was some criticism of Roland Garros organisers for their handling of the matter.\n\nFrench Tennis Federation President Gilles Moretton read a prepared statement on Monday offering Osaka their support but the irony of him not taking questions, given the context of the row, was not lost on some.\n\n\u201cSo the FFT handled the Ms Osaka mental health concerns without empathy or sensitivity. Then the FFT President refuses to take questions at a presser. An own goal,\u201d wrote former Australian tennis official Richard Ings.\n\nJapan\u2019s Osaka, who according to sports business website Sportico earned $55.2 million over the past 12 months, is expected to be one of the biggest attractions at the Tokyo Olympics in July and August.\n\nThe 23-year-old concluded her statement by saying she would be taking some time away from tennis and organisers of that already troubled event will be desperately hoping she will be back on court long before the Games get underway.",

Since that report\u2019s publication in 2015, an additional 900 have been identified.\n\nParents \u201cspoke of children who went to school and never returned,\u201d the report reads.\n\nA working group established by the commission in 2007 proposed, among other things, a study to identify unmarked gravesites. While the federal government initially denied the C$1.5 million ($1.2 million) needed to conduct this work, the government announced in 2019 C$33.8 million over three years for a \u2018National Residential School Student Death Register\u2019 and an online registry of residential school cemeteries.\n\nNow there are renewed calls for Canada to do more to uncover what happened.\n\nIn meetings across the country, indigenous communities are working to figure out how to investigate, said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, President of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely essential that there be a national program to thoroughly investigate all residential school sites in regard to unmarked mass graves,\u201d he said.",

However, it was criticised on the grounds that this could imperil birds and by the mother of a girl named Robin.",
