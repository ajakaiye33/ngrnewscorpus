          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has disclosed that his regime is in talks with the World Bank to obtain $30m to build a vaccine plant in Nigeria.\n\nHe said he hoped that the vaccine plant to be built in collaboration with May & Baker Nigeria Plc would commence next year.\n\nBuhari, represented by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, made this known in Jos on Saturday during the graduation of Senior Executive Course 43 participants of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies.\n\nThe event was attended by Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, among other dignitaries.\n\nSpeaking through Osinbajo, the President said, \u201cNigeria is in talks with the World Bank\u2019s private lending arm and other lenders to raise about $30m to help finance a vaccine plant \u2013 Biovaccines Nigeria Ltd, (with 49 per cent of the company owned by the Nigerian government and the balance held by May & Baker Nigeria Plc), plans to begin construction of the plant in the first quarter of next year.\n\n\u201cThe plant will initially \u2018fill and finish,\u2019 which means importing the raw materials for the vaccines and then packaging them for distribution. Full manufacturing is expected to follow.\u201d\n\nBuhari said but for providence and the good policies of his government, the COVID-19 pandemic would have wreaked unimaginable havoc on the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe GDP contracted to -6.10 per cent during the second quarter of 2020; the oil price at one point was about $10 a barrel and then finally settled at about $45 per barrel during the second quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cUnemployment went up to 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020; the transportation sector declined by 49 per cent; the hospitality sector fell 40 per cent; the education sector fell 24 per cent; real estate declined by 22 per cent; trade declined by 17 per cent and construction declined by 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cNigeria was in a terrible economic situation and in response, the President took two swift steps. One was to set up a small inter-ministerial Committee headed by the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, to quickly work out the implications and the immediate mitigation for the economic shocks we were headed for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second thing the President did swiftly was to direct a team of ministers and interagency heads to draw up a 12-month economic emergency plan, which became known as the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\n\u201cWe were clear that the only way of avoiding an economic disaster that could last for years was for the government to essentially put forward a major fiscal stimulus plan. Such a plan must have clear objectives of saving jobs and creating new ones, supporting businesses that may close down, and employees that may not be paid during lockdowns, and, of course, healthcare support to reduce the COVID-19 caseload. So, we promptly put forward a stimulus plan in the order of N2.3 trillion.\u201d\n\nEarlier , the Director General of NIPSS, Brig. Gen. Chukwuemeka Udaya (retd.), said 85 Senior Executive Course participants passed out during the ceremony.\n\nAccording to him, the participants toured 14 states within Nigeria and also visited six African countries and five countries outside the continent in the course of the Senior Executive Course which began in February 2021.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Farouk Ahmed who spoke to journalists in Abuja at the Petroleum Regulators\u2019 1st Invitational Golf Tournament organised by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, NUPRC and NMDPRA, assured consumers that there would be no price increase in the immediate future.\n\nAhmed who was represented at the event by Ogbogu Ukoha, Executive Director, Distribution Systems, Storage and Retail Infrastructure, said the government was working hard to resolve the challenges faced by operators.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI will like to assure everybody that it is mere speculation. There will be no increase in the pump price, not in the near future.\n\n\u201cThis is peak consumption period for Nigerians. Our focus must be on the average Nigerian who is on the street.\n\n\u201cPeople will be travelling now and so you don\u2019t increase pump price arbitrarily like that. So the pump price will be maintained and Nigerians should feel free to travel\u201d.\n\nHe however pointed out \u201cBut having said that, yes there are issues. Last two weeks the chief executive led, for the first time, we had every major player under the same roof.\n\n\u201cThey raised the issues, the issues were addressed as much as we could and we all left with happy faces and handshakes.\n\nALSO READ: FG moves to protect rights of children, arrest perpetrators of abuse\n\n\u201cThis is the way forward for now. The NNPC was represented by as high as the Group Executive Director, Downstream, who assured that there will be sufficient supply during this period.\n\n\u201cAnd even on the dollar payment issue, they (NNPC) conceded to take freight in naira. This is because as we know the dollar issue is critical. So I will like to assure everybody that there will be no pump price increase,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking to journalists at the event, the Chief Executive of NUPRC, Engr. Gbenga Komolafe noted that despite the global clamour for energy transition, the Commission has had fruitful discussions with investors in the industry.\n\nKomolafe stated that Nigeria needed to increase its oil and gas production to meet its national economic and social demands.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince I came on board we\u2019ve started various engagements with investors including international oil companies and other independent producers.\n\n\u201cThe feedback we are getting from our engagements with investors has been quite positive regardless of the developments in the outside world, especially with regards to energy transition.\n\n\u201cThe PIA (Petroleum Industry Act) has offered very robust and attractive fiscal regimes and so there\u2019s still quite a lot of investment opportunities in the Nigerian oil sector and we try to canvass that to investors regardless of the challenges posed by the energy transition\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the golf tournament which was held at the IBB International Golf and Country Club, Maitama, Komolafe said: \u201cWe need productivity in the oil and gas sector and it is in realisation of that that the NUPRC has put together this tournament with our sister agency, because it is important for our workers to be healthy.\n\n\u201cApart from the health benefits of the game of golf, it is a means of social connectivity and networking.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nA new report released Wednesday at the ongoing Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore has revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has further pushed an estimated 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa into extreme poverty, wiping out more than five years of progress.\n\nThe report noted that while some ground will be made up as economies across the continent recover, it will still not be enough to meet the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal, SDG, of eradicating poverty by 2030 \u2013 a target that was already a stretch before the pandemic hit.\n\nThe Bloomberg Economics Special Report entitled: \u201cLong COVID: Jobs, Prices and Growth in the Enduring Pandemic focused on the challenges the pandemic poses to growth, inflation and development globally.\n\nA piece titled Half a Billion in Poverty and Counting: \u201cHow COVID Derailed Africa\u2019s Development Goals\u201d models how a lost year of growth has affected poverty reduction goals in Africa.\n\nThe turn of the century saw Africa\u2019s economy on an upward trajectory due to reduced conflict, allowing for better economic policies and increased macroeconomic stability.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund and World Bank\u2019s Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative in the early 2000s led to a substantial reduction in debt levels, freeing up domestic resources and improving donor relations. Increased trade and buoyant commodity prices also played a role, with GDP per capita in resource-rich countries growing twice as fast.\n\nThis resulted in better living standards for the populations, people became healthier, access to basic services such as water and sanitation improved, school enrolment increased, and the share of people living below the World Bank\u2019s extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day fell from 58 percent in 2000 to 42 percent by 2015.\n\nFrom 2016, growth has faltered. The slowdown started a year after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 the universal call to eradicate poverty by 2030 through progress on 17 integrated goals that range from health, education, inequality and climate change. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to lag behind on most of the goals.\n\nMost notable is the lag on poverty reduction; before the pandemic in 2019, Africa had more than 60 percent of the world\u2019s 700 million poor.\n\nAccording to the report, the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to throw the region further behind.\n\nIn 2020, sub-Saharan Africa plunged into its first recession in more than 25 years, erasing at least five years of progress in fighting poverty.\n\nEconomists forecast that lost ground won\u2019t be recovered until 2024 when the expected per capita output to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe report also pointed out that sluggish vaccine rollout means that many countries will continue to deal with virus outbreaks that delay the safe reopening of their economies.\n\n\u201cRising debt service costs will continue to squeeze out much-needed development spending even when the virus effects fade.\n\n\u201cThe persistent impact of the pandemic on incomes means the poverty rate would translate into almost 25 million more people living in poverty, compared with pre-COVID estimates, \u201cthe report stated.\n\nThe report further noted that to make notable progress on poverty eradication, Africa will require immense support from the international community given the region\u2019s limited resources. To address this gap, funding from official creditors including the IMF, the largest providers of external debt, remain crucial for sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past 20 years, China has become one of the largest creditors on the continent and has seen its share of debt owed rise from about 40 per cent in 2010 to more than 63 per cent at the end of 2019.",

          "text": "A few days after a 14-year-old SSS1 student cum trainee vulcaniser was allegedly killed by police stray bullets in Ajasa-Command area of Alimosho, a Lagos suburb, parents of the victim have cried out for justice. Kunle Akinrinade reports.\n\nDarkness descended on the world of Abidemi Sanyaolu 11 years ago following the loss of her sight to a mysterious illness.\n\nSince then, she took solace in the fact that her 14-year-old son, Mubarak, always ensured that she was well taken care of before he left home for school in the morning and upon his return in the afternoon.\n\nAnother ugly fate befell Abidemi recently as the family lost Mubarak\u2019s older brother to a strange illness, leaving Mubarak as the only surviving child.\n\nThe darkness that had enveloped Abidemi\u2019s life tickened further on November 3 with the gruesome killing of Mubarak during a protest provoked by the alleged killing of a tricycle operator by the police on the Ajasa-Command route.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nUntil his death on November 3, Mubarak, an SSS1 student of District Secondary School, Meiran, was also a vulcaniser apprentice in the neighbourhood.\n\nOn the fateful day, the lad was said to have hurriedly fed his mother on his return from school in the afternoon and left for the workshop when a protest broke out between the police and tricycle operators who accused the former of stabbing one of their members to death for refusing to give an officer the sum of N100 as bribe.\n\nA detachment of operatives from the nearby Meiran Police Division were deployed to disperse the crowd of protesters when Mubarak was hit by bullets allegedly fired by one of the policemen, ripping his intestine open.\n\nLamenting the incident and the ugly fate that has been her lot in life, Mubarak\u2019s mother said: \u201dI lost my eyes mysteriously after I took ill about 11 years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201dMy husband works as a Keke Marwa (commercial tricycle) operator, so he leaves home early. Our son, Mubarak, has been the one taking me around to have my bath, use the toilet and even feed me.\u2019\n\n\u201dHe was a student and apprentice vulcaniser. He goes to his trainer when he returns from school and was returning home from work when he was killed. \u201d\n\nAbidemi, swathed by sympathisers, told The Nation amid lamentations at her residence on Thompson Alade Street, Ajasa Command area of Agbado-Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area, also said that Mubarak was trying to cross the road after the owner of the workshop where he was training to become a vulcaniser had dismissed him and other apprentices for the day and shut his shop when policemen who were drafted to quell the ongoing protest started shooting indiscriminately.\n\n\u201cOne of the shots hit my son and killed him instantly. I was at home when some people rushed in and laid my son\u2019s body at my doorstep. He was 14 and my only guide after I lost my sight. When they brought his body, I could only touch it to ascertain that it was him,\u201d she added.\n\nSearch for justice\n\nIn search of justice for her son, the distraught woman rushed to Meiran Police Station crying for justice, but her presence in company with other sympathisers was not welcomed as men of the police division allegedly threatened to shoot at her and the crowd that accompanied her to the station.\n\nShe said; \u201cI was held by the hand and taken to the Meiran Police Division by sympathizers, but the policemen at the station threatened to shoot at us, causing the people that took me there to hurriedly disperse and brought me home, saying that they didn\u2019t want the police to kill me the way they killed my son.\n\n\u201dI only recently lost my older son. Now the police have killed my only remaining child and I am left with nothing. To make matters worse, the police authorities have not come to commiserate or sympathise with us as we speak.\n\n\u201cI have no hope again because the boy was my only hope for the future. I have lost my sight and cannot see anymore.\n\n\u201cHe was the only one taking care of me. So, who will take care of me now?\n\n\u201cI want justice for the sake of my innocent son killed by errant policemen,\u201d she added.\n\nAbidemi\u2019s husband and Mubarak\u2019s father, Olamilekan Sanyaolu, a commercial tricycle operator, told our correspondent that his son was killed by policemen drafted to the scene of the protest.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy son was returning from work. His boss actually closed the shop and asked all the apprentices, including my son, to go home when policemen started shooting sporadically.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, he was killed by a stray bullet while crossing the road on his way home.\n\n\u201cI was seated in a tricycle in a compound nearby when people rushed in and asked me to come to come and see something. On getting there, I discovered it was my son that was felled by police bullets.\n\nHe was in a pool of blood on the floor. But I was prevented by the police from taking his body away because the policemen evacuated his body.\n\n\u201cI saw my son\u2019s body being taken away by the police in their van, and as we speak, the police have yet to release his body for burial.\n\n\u201cHe was the one running errands and taking care of his mother who can no longer see. He would take her to the toilet and the bathroom and feed her before going to school in the morning and on his return in the evening before going to the shop here he was an apprentice.\n\n\u201cI want justice for my son. He was my only hope and I am crying out now so the police authorities can do something about it.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with our correspondent, Mubarak\u2019s boss, Taofeek Abidemi Quadri, said: \u201cImmediately the protest commenced, I closed my workshop and asked all my apprentices to go home.\n\n\u201cI had barely left the place when gunshots started booming and I was told that Mubarak had been killed by a stray bullet. They shot directly at the protesters and one of the shots killed Mubarak.\n\n\u201cI tried to carry him (Mubarak) from the floor, but the policemen fired teargas canister and I had to flee the scene due to the effect of the teargas on my eyes.\n\n\u201cWe want justice for the soul of Mubarak because of his parents, especially his mother who has lost her sight.\u201d\n\nContacted, the spokesman of the Lagos State Police Command, Mr. Adekunle Ajisebutu, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said the matter had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti, Yaba, Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, has ordered that the matter be transferred to SCID, Panti for diligent investigation.\n\n\u201cYou can rest assured that we will issue a public statement at the conclusion of the ongoing investigation,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Job Osazuwa\n\nThe traditional and social media spaces have been awash with hot debate over the report submitted recently by the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters.\n\nFor one year, Nigerians waited patiently for the report to be released. But when it was eventually done, the report that is said to have indicted Nigerian Army and Police of cold-blooded \u201cmassacre\u201d of innocent civilians calling for an end to police brutality, ended up polarizing rather than uniting them.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nSince it was leaked to the public, many Nigerians, particularly the youths, have lambasted the government and its agencies for allegedly killing unarmed protesters. But there are others who have accused its compilers of bias. They insist that the report is characterised by fiction, discrepancies and assumptions. On radio, TV, social media, newspaper pages, this has led to arguments, accusations and counter-accusations. Those asking for a thorough examination of the report said they cannot understand why some persons said to be dead, according to the report, are still alive.\n\nThe panel, led by Justice Doris Okuwobi in the report submitted to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on November 15, 2021, disclosed that at least 48 protesters were either shot dead, injured with bullet wounds, or assaulted by soldiers sent to Lekki Tollgate on October 20, 2020 to disperse the peaceful protesters.\n\nJubilation, satisfaction among #EndSARS supporters\n\nAs witnessed so far, some of the Nigerians that mobilised other citizens to join the nationwide are jubilating over the report, saying that they have been vindicated. They include Senator Shehu Sani. Shortly after the report went viral, he took to his twitter handle to write: \u201cIt is like people are holding cutlasses and sticks and looking for those who denied the Lekki massacre.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Rinu Oduola twitted: \u201cEveryone that joined hands in making us doubt our sanity regarding the Lekki massacre, God will punish you\u201d! A journalist, Fisayo Soyombo, also tweeted: \u201cThe Lagos doctor sent by the state to go round hospitals to confirm the #EndSARS casualties from the Lekki massacre and withdraw the bullets extricated from the injured protesters, how do you feel now that all you tried to cover up has been fully exposed\u201d?\n\nDoubts, unanswered questions\n\nBy way of providing a contrary view to that held by those applauding the \u201cgood work\u201d done by the panel, and calling for the crucifixion of those indicted, a certain Otabor Osagie wrote on his facebook page: \u201cNathaniel Solomon one of those the panel said to have died has been found alive. Even Kolade Salami that SARS operatives killed in 2019 was listed among Lekki victims. He even granted an interview narrating how he fainted.\u201d In a telephone conversation with the reporter, another Nigerian, Amos Tunde challenged the objectivity of the report. \u201cHow can you include those who are aggrieved to be members of the panel? I knew there would be a conflict of interest at the end of the day. And that is what we are seeing today.\u201d He lamented that though there was enough time for the investigation to be neatly done, there are many mix-ups. \u201cAnd, you don\u2019t expect Nigerians to accept this report.\u201d\n\nAnother Nigerian and public intellectual, Mr Temitope Ajayi, wrote on his Facebook Page: \u201cIf the leaked document in circulation is actually what was submitted to Governor Sanwo-Olu yesterday, the state government should demand some kind of refund on expended tax payers\u2019 money. I can\u2019t see any reason why it should take one year to put together the report in circulation. It is very shoddy in preparation and untidy in its assumptions and conclusions.\n\n\u201cFor some strange reasons, the report has no word for the police officers that were killed and many victims of the violent protests, especially those who lost livelihoods. \u201cDoes it mean the lives of the murdered police officers are not important or they deserved to die in such undignified manner?\n\n\u201cIt is really befuddling that a panel that sat for a whole year didn\u2019t pay attention to details and facts.\n\n\u201cThe panel listed Nathaniel Solomon, a man that granted video interview as a deceased victim of LekkiTollgate. The video interview was published on September 11, 2021. Kolade Salami that was killed in April 2019 by men of SARS was named as another deceased. I have seen other posts where three names among the 11 listed as deceased by the Panel are said to be alive and kicking.\n\n\u201cI guess the panel relied more on social media rumours and gist to arrive at some of the conclusions.\u201d\n\nCalling for caution by all parties involved, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho, in a press release, advised Nigerians to restrain themselves from spreading rumours that will further compound the issues, insisting that the purpose of government in setting up the panel was to heal wounds.\n\nA part of the release read: \u201cThe Lagos State Government has noted the various reactions that have followed the submission of the report. There have been arguments in the public space over the report. There is need for us to restrain ourselves from nullifying the good intentions of the government in setting up this panel, which was well encouraged to do its job \u2013 a fact that was acknowledged by the panel.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015, a committee has been set up to bring up a White Paper on the report to determine the next line of action. At the appropriate time, the government will make known its views on all the issues raised by the Panel through the release of a White Paper.\u201d\n\nErrors, discrepancies, irregularities in report\n\nAnalysts who subjected the document to a \u201cthorough examination\u201d pointed out, according to them, some irreconcilable differences. One of them, Adejare Ibrahim, noted: \u201cThe panel, under the chairmanship of Justice Okuwobi, did a great disservice to many Nigerians. The report is a pure distortion of glaring facts and cannot, in the face of in-depth probe and sophisticated analysis, stand the test of time. The report is fraught with discrepancies, irregularities and fallacious stances, which further substantiates the claim of some Nigerians that no one truly died in Lekki Tollgate.\u201d\n\nHe gave out some proofs of the points he was trying to make as follows: \u201cKolade Johnson (Salami) was shot during a raid by officers of the Nigeria Police Command at Onipetesi, Lagos-Abeokuta Road while watching an English premiership match between Tottenham and Manchester United on March 31, 2019. Why did they mix it up with Lekki issue? Kolade had nothing to do with Lekki violence.\n\n\u201cOn Nathaniel Solomon and Abuta Solomon, on September 11, 2021, a national newspaper had an interview with Nathaniel, where he claimed that he fainted the day he saw his brother\u2019s lifeless body at Lekki Tollgate. The person he claimed to be his brother was Abuta. The panel also published Nathaniel Solomon as one of the Lekki casualties.\n\n\u201cAmidst the spread of fake news by EndSARS supporters that one Folorunso Olabisi was shot by the Army and his corpse deposited at St. Nicholas Hospital, VI, Lagos, the management of the Hospital later debunked the malicious claims. Till date, no one has countered the claim of the hospital. How then the name later crept into the report is surprising.\n\n\u201cOne Jide was mentioned. This is laughable. I don\u2019t want to believe that a retired Justice of the Lagos High Court approved this for public consumption. Who is Jide? No surname and no description. The same thing with Tola; Wisdom, no surnames or further details.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he mentioned other instances in the report, which he said were difficult to reconcile with what really transpired, particularly after one year of investigation. The panel should have understood that Nigerians were critical thinkers who would not accept everything thrown at them without probing, he noted. \u201cAfter all, the family members of the Ikoyi collapsed building victims, within hours, quickly showed up after the incident. Why have the family members of the Lekki victims not shown up after a year? Are they still afraid? I implore Sanwo-Olu to think deep and ponder on this report before accepting it as a fact,\u201d Ibrahim said.\n\nHe opined that those who killed and maimed Nigeria\u2019s security operatives and innocent citizens and destroyed public and private property deserved to be punished, not compensated for their criminal acts.\n\nLeaked report not Govt White Paper \u2013 Panel member\n\nWhile being featured on a live TV programme in Lagos, a private solicitor who represented the interest of Lagos State Government at the panel along with his colleagues, Abiodun Jelili Owonikoko (SAN), said that by law, the decisions, recommendations, resolutions of the panel were not meant for public consumption in the first instance, but to be reviewed by the government before releasing it to the public.\n\nHe quickly clarified that even the government\u2019s decision on it, which comes by way of White Paper, is not binding on anybody that is aggrieved. And, concerned persons were entitled to subject it to the judicial review in a court of law.\n\n\u201cI am totally shocked about what I read to be the report, particularly the finding with regards to 40-something victims, some of whom were described as deceased, some of them described as missing but all attributed by the panel to what is called the Lekki incident. My opinion here is based on my first-hand information and involvement in the proceedings and the record that we have.\u201d\n\nWhen Owonikoko was told that the youth representative at the panel had already confirmed the authenticity of the report circulating online except for some typographical errors, he expressed his shock at a member of the panel already discussing the content of the report on a national TV against the oath of fidelity, impartiality, and confidentiality guiding the activities of the panel. \u201cI cannot be part of those who would justify extra-judicial killings or abuse of state power,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the evidence that we were able to gather at the hearing, there was not a single thing that was established.\n\n\u201cI am not speaking for Lagos State Government. Nevertheless, I can\u2019t pretend not to be aware that certain documents have been circulating in the social media. I have seen one of such reports. It is unsigned, but it contains the names of all members and I did not, on going through it, see any indication that it was not a unanimous position. It may well be, however, that it is a draft of a minority opinion, because giving what I know, having spent one whole year from beginning of the sitting of the panel till the end, except for occasions where one or two of my colleagues had to stand in for me, we have the record of proceedings.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that some members of the panel had personal interest, which he said defiled the goal of submitting an objective and neutral report. He accused certain members of the panel of being in the habit of consistently taking to the social media to share their pre-informed opinions on the issues being investigated. He described such acts as being in sharp contrast to every goal the panel originally set out to achieve.\n\n\u201cThe mistake I observe now that the government made was that there should have been a different panel entirely to look into the Lekki incident. The panel that was constituted originally was meant to address victims and abuse of police brutality and SARS. There was no single member of the panel who had a personal case that he wanted to establish. There was no reason we should be afraid that anybody there would have a pre-conceived notion or a settled position that they were going to be opened to being persuaded by evidence-led.\n\n\u201cBut in the course of that panel\u2019s work, this incident happened, but this incident had protagonists and antagonists. Unfortunately, at least, three members of the panel were picked from those who were protagonists of the case against the police that people like us also represent. I was fully in support of what was going on up until October 20, even up until the night, until I became wiser the next morning when I did my enquiry. Those members are ordinarily not entitled to sit in this panel. But they are members of this panel where we were trying to establish who were killed, at Lekki Tollgate, whether Lekki Tollgate Concession Company withdrew camera to suppress information. This is the case they have been making on their own even before the panel sat. So from the very beginning, that panel lacks the judicial competence to determine this issue.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why he didn\u2019t raise the alarm about the contention while the sittings were on, than waiting for the report which now seems unfavourable to the Lagos State Government, Owonikoko said that the duty of Lagos State Government, the burden on them was to establish whether they were the ones that deployed Army to the scene or not. According to him, the evidence before the panel and the finding did not support such a suggestion. He said that was the only thing Lagos State had to explain.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "Self-determination struggle: Why agitation persists in South-East",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nThere is a palpable feeling of despondency across the length and breadth of the South East over the people\u2019s condition in the Nigerian federation as presently constituted. Though several people are in sync with the agitation of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) and other similar separatist groups for an independent state of Biafra, the apex Igbo sociocultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has been insistent on dialogue that would translate to the restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nTo Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the agitation and youth restiveness in the South East of Nigeria is simply a reaction or an effect or the consequences of an orchestrated alienation by the Federal Government over the years.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAccording to the group, until some of the issues of obvious injustice against the Igbo are seen to be addressed, the chains of catastrophe that threaten the corporate existence of Nigeria may well-nigh be inevitable.\n\n\u201cAsk any Igbo any day, all he wants is a sense of belonging in a country anchored on equity, justice and fairness,\u201d Ohanaeze maintained.\n\nNoting that it is extremely difficult to have peace amidst injustice, President General of Ohanaeze, George Obiozor, recently emphatically declared: \u201cWe need not look elsewhere to know that IPOB is simply an exponent of Igbo collective sentiments and predicaments in our tortuous journey and an unquantifiable sacrifice for one Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonnia, also advanced similar thoughts recently.\n\nIn a speech entitled: \u201cIf Zik were alive,\u201d delivered at the Second Igbo Nsukka Zik Annual Merit Award 2021 held at Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre, Abuja on Wednesday, and with the theme: \u201cPreserving Zik\u2019s legacies for national unity,\u201d Ogbonnia identified the case of the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu as the most intricate and complex challenge to the Igbo at present.\n\nSpeaking at the event organised by the Igbo Nsukka United Front in honour of the first President of Nigeria, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Ohanaeze spokesman called Kanu a persuasive visionary charismatic leader whose followership was catholic, saying that the agitation for Biafra that he leads has inadvertently become the opium of the Igbo masses.\n\n\u201cLike most visionaries, Kanu has identified the various ills in the Nigerian society and how the Igbo are victimized in the process. He has raised the awareness and consciousness of the Igbo youth that anybody against Kanu is considered either an oppressor or an agent of the oppressors. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has also created a vision with a strongly held assurance of how the new Biafra will look like; an Eldorado of abundance, affluence, communalism, love, joy and happiness. And as in Christian or Islamic religion, the adherents are prepared to deprive themselves the enjoyment the contemporary world provides in an anticipation of the fullness of joy in the life hereafter. As in religion, martyrdom becomes a stronger visa for the benefits thereafter. Therefore, Biafra has inadvertently become the opium of the Igbo masses. It must therefore be appreciated that Nnamdi Kanu has become a phenomenon,\u201d Ogbonnia asserted.\n\nTwo leading Igbo groups- the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), yesterday, gave further insight into why the agitation for an independent state for the Igbo may not die soon.\n\nAccording to the ADF, the crisis of the Nigerian federation has reached a stage where many Igbo are getting convinced that the only fundamental solution lies in the attainment of sovereignty as an independent republic under the African Union.\n\nChairman, Media and Publicity Bureau of ADF, Abia Onyike who stated this in a position paper in Enugu, noted that the difference between ADF and apex Yoruba sociocultural organisation, Afenifere is that Afenifere advocates restructuring of the Nigerian federation along regional lines but \u201cwe believe that only the transformation of the ethnic nationalities into autonomous republics can resolve the crises of the artificial federation.\u201d\n\nADF said there was the need for Ndigbo to enjoy the maximum benefits of national sovereignty, which the Hausa-Fulani hegemons have blocked since 1960.\n\nOnyike argued that only a sovereign nationhood can permit Igbo civilization to blossom and not to be drawn back because of the unfavourable political relationship between them and their neighbours in the chaotic and crisis-ridden Nigerian federation. He said: \u201cNigeria is a federation of divided people. The British created Nigeria as an omnibus state to frustrate Igbo advancement in world affairs.\n\n\u201cWe live in a generation globally where what is prevalent is the formation of organic states as distinct from empire states. The organic state is one in which the people have a common language and a common culture with minor variations. Examples abound. From 1989 to date, over 25 new countries (states) have emerged from Asia, Europe and Africa.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, the UN passed a resolution making it legal and democratic for ethnic nationalities to exercise their rights to self-determination. Igbo nation is a major or mega nationality and has all it takes to stand as an independent republic away from the violence, crises and perpetual uncertainties of Nigeria\u2019s failed and artificial federation.\n\n\u201cThe crises of the Nigerian federation can only be resolved through the proper understanding of the facts raised above.\u201d\n\nAlso, COSEYL said that the youths in Igbo land would continue to agitate for self-determination unless the Federal Government addressed the lingering marginalisation of the zone.\n\nPresident General of the group, Goodluck Ibem particularly frowned at the non-inclusion of Igbo in strategic federal appointments.\n\nHe catalogued some of the grievances of the Igbo thus: \u201cThe Federal Government marginalises the people of South East in various ways and forms. For instance, no South East son or daughter is a Service Chief or a member of the Security Council. The list of how and where Igbo are marginalised by the present government is endless.\n\n\u201cYoung Igbo graduates who are eminently qualified to be employed or to occupy some positions of authority in federal government ministries, parastatals and agencies are not employed or given the opportunity to even sit for exams or attend interviews. Round pegs are used in square holes, which has been drawing us back as a country.\n\n\u201cThe security agents deployed to the South East zone kill young and vibrant Igbo youth arbitrarily without any provocation whatsoever. The security agents paid with taxpayers\u2019 money intimidate, harass, detain and dehumanize Igbo youths without any reason to do so.\n\n\u201cThese mindless harassment and intimidation make youths to want to opt out of the country since they are no longer needed in a country they belong.\n\n\u201cArmy, police, Navy and other security roadblocks have become a point where security agents brazenly extort from motorists, tricycle and motorcycle riders. There are uncountable roadblocks on South East roads.\n\n\u201cThese roadblocks make life difficult, unbearable and living hell for our youths who make a living through business. The worst aspect of the extortion by security agents in South East is that they kill at will whosoever that fails or refuses to give them bribe and will openly declare before the hearing of everyone that \u2018I will kill you and nothing will happen\u2019.\n\n\u201cSadly, Igbo youths who refused to pay bribes have been extra-judicially killed by these security agents deployed on our roads and those involved have not been prosecuted or brought to justice for crimes against humanity. It is very sad.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is not building infrastructures in South East the way it is building in other geo-political zones. The Federal Government has built double-gauge rail system in other zones and even to our neighbouring country, Niger Republic but none has been built or even awarded in South East zone. We have been really relegated to the background by this present government.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

Ibem added that in the judiciary, the federal government had systematically removed people from South East from the roll of judges so that no Igbo man or woman will emerge as Chief of Justice of Nigeria.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

But he assured that he would consider it. Buhari gave the assurance when he received a group under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, at State House, Abuja.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari stressed that the request runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary.\n\nThe President told the 93-year-old statesman: \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious. In the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it.\u201d\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the judiciary, President Buhari said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Chief Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace. The nonagenarian had described the situation in the South-East as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that businesses have collapsed, education is crumbling, and there is fear everywhere.\n\nHe pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying,\u201d stressing that he could control him, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with them (IPOB), but I am highly respected in Igbo land today.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa.

The implication of your request is very serious\u2026 But the demand you made is heavy, I will consider it\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThough, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared that an unconditional release of the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, currently standing trial for treason, runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers, and that such a demand was quite heavy, nonetheless, he said he would consider the plea for amnesty for him.\n\nA group of Igbo elders, under the aegis of \u201cHighly Respected Igbo Greats,\u201d led by First Republic parliamentarian and minister of aviation, Mbazulike Amaechi, requested the amnesty for Kanu, during a visit to Buhari at the State House, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nWhile receiving the delegation, led by the 93 year-old statesman, Buhari said: \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious.\n\n\u201cIn the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with a very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy, I will consider it.\u201d\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, the President said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and was brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from the outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nThe nonagenarian had described the situation in the Southeast as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that \u201cbusinesses have collapsed, education is crumbling amid a reign of fear.\u201d\n\nAmaechi pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that he could control him, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with IPOB, but I am highly respected in Igboland today.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr. President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Igbo Great\u2019s delegation were former Governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, Goddy Uwazurike and Tagbo Amaechi.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Wants implementation of cost-reflective electricity tariffs from next January\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nContrary to the federal government\u2019s plan to remove subsidy on petrol in the second half of next year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised the Nigerian government to fully remove fuel subsidy and move to a market-based pricing mechanism in early 2022 as stipulated in the 2021 Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nThe IMF, in its 2021 Article IV Mission statement released yesterday also projected that despite high oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit would widen in 2021 to 6.3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nFiscal deficit is projected at 3.93 per cent and 3.39 per cent of GDP in Nigeria\u2019s 2021 and 2022 budgets respectively.\n\nThe IMF, in the report said: \u201cThe complete removal of regressive fuel and electricity subsidies is a near-term priority, combined with adequate compensatory measures for the poor.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the implementation of cost-reflective electricity tariffs as of January 2022 should not be delayed. Well-targeted social assistance will be needed to cushion any negative impacts on the poor particularly in light of still elevated inflation.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s past experiences with fuel subsidy removal, which have all been short-lived and reversed, underscore the importance of building a consensus and improving public trust regarding the protection of the poor and efficient and transparent use of the saved rsources.\u201d\n\nThe IMF observed that there were significant downside risks to the near-term fiscal outlook from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, weak security situation and spending pressures associated with the electoral cycle.\n\nAccording to the IMF, over the medium term, without bold revenue mobilisation efforts, fiscal deficits are projected to stay elevated above the pre-pandemic levels with public debt increasing to 43 per cent in 2026.\n\nIt stated: \u201cWith the emergence of fuel subsidies and slow progress on revenue mobilisation, the fiscal outlook faces significant risks. Continued reliance on administrative measures to address persistent foreign exchange shortages is negatively impacting confidence.\u201d\n\nThe IMF observed that the Nigerian economy \u201cis recovering\u201d from a historic downturn benefiting from government policy support, rising oil prices and international financial assistance.\n\nIt noted that the Nigerian authorities\u2019 pro-active approach had contained the COVID-19 infection rates and fatalities, adding that with the emergence of fuel subsidies and slow progress on revenue mobilisation, the fiscal outlook faces significant risks.\n\nIMF said: \u201cThe economy is recovering from a historic downturn. Helped by government policy support, rebounding oil prices and international financial aid, Nigeria exited the recession in 2020 Q4, earlier than expected. Output rose by 5.4 per cent (y-o-y) in the second quarter, mainly reflecting base effects from transport and trade sectors and continued strong growth in the IT sector.\n\n\u201cHowever, manufacturing and oil sectors remain weak, reflecting continued foreign exchange shortages, and security and technical challenges. Headline inflation rose sharply during the pandemic reaching a peak of 18.2 per cent y-o-y in March 2021 but has since declined helped by the new harvest season and opening of the land borders.\n\n\u201cReported unemployment rates are yet to come down although COVID-19 monthly surveys show the employment level to be back at its pre-pandemic level.\n\nNoting that the outlook is for a subdued recovery, the IMF observed that while Nigeria\u2019s real GDP is projected to grow by 2.6 per cent this year and continue in the range of 2.6-2.7 per cent per annum over the medium term, \u201cthis is just above the population growth rate implying stagnant per capita income in the medium term.\u201d\n\nDespite an ease in food prices, it said inflation is projected to remain in double-digits, in the absence of monetary policy reforms.\n\nIt also alluded to significant downside risks to the near-term outlook arising from the uncertain course of the pandemic and the domestic security situation, in the medium term.\n\nIt added that there were upside risks from faster-than-expected reaching of the Dangote refinery\u2019s production capacity along with effective implementation of the 2021 Petroleum Industry Act in terms of higher manufacturing production and investment in the oil sector.\n\nIMF called for major reforms in fiscal, exchange rate, trade and governance to alter what it described as \u201cthe long-running lackluster growth path.\u201d\n\nThe IMF listed near-term priorities for Nigeria to include the implementation of e-customs reforms, including efficient procedures and controls, developing a Value Added Tax (VAT) compliance improvement programme, improving compliance across large, medium, and micro/small taxpayers and rationalising tax incentives and customs duty waivers. the recent passage of the PIA and stressed its timely implementation.\n\nIt stated that preliminary assessments by the IMF and the World Bank suggest that the approved fiscal terms would provide greater incentives to invest in the oil and gas industry but would reduce the fiscal take from new and converted fields.\n\nOn exchange rate policy, the IMF called for reduced administrative measures and room for a market-clearing unified exchange rate.\n\nIt also endorsed steps taken toward unification of the exchange rate and stressed the need for further actions.\n\nThe Fund stated: \u201cThe discontinuation of the official exchange rate is a step in the right direction, but continued dependence on administrative measures to address FX shortages sustains uncertainties and increases the risks of a sudden and large adjustment in the exchange rate.\n\n\u201cTo preserve competitiveness, any exchange rate adjustment should be accompanied by clear communications regarding exchange rate policy going forward, macroeconomic policies to contain inflation and structural policies to facilitate new investment.\n\n\u201cA further move toward a market-clearing exchange rate will also help build foreign exchange buffers through higher capital inflows.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "text": "The management of an insurance corporation, Leadway Assurance Company has denied defrauding an Abuja-based man, Jolayemi Woleola.\n\nWoleola had accused the insurance corporation of fraud involving over multi-million naira claims on his damaged vehicle.\n\nHe described the attitude and disposition of the company to his insurance claim as appalling, disappointing, annoying and frustrating.\n\n\"I entered into a vehicle insurance contract with Leadway covering my Mercedes Benz E 300 2017 model. The insured car was involved in an accident with a trailer on Kubwa express in Abuja on 23/07/2021,\u201d he had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\"I presented my claim to Leadway after relevant documents like the police report were issued. The Leadway insurance has maliciously refused to reinstate me to the position I was in prior to the accident.\n\n\"Leadway has been coming up with excuses including outright lies to refuse the fulfilment of their obligation towards me.\n\n\"Leadway started from questioning the veracity of an accident which threatened my life to outright lies of claiming to visit the hospital where I was treated of bleeding and being told no patient was treated on that day to twisting outright glaring facts as to the value of the vehicle prior to insuring same.\u201d\n\nReacting in a letter signed by its Head of Legal Services Department, Sunday Oroleke to SaharaReporters, the company said it was shocked by the allegation of \u201cfraudulent intent\u201d made by Woleola and thereby rebutted it.\n\nLeadway said the insured rejected a settlement offer of N3,711,955.09 and demanded N13,443,982.77 for a vehicle he claimed to have bought for N15,000,000.00.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cOur attention has been brought to a publication by Sahara Reporters regarding an allegation by one of our customers, Mr. Jolayemi Woleola (insured), that we fraudulently denied his motor vehicle insurance claim.\n\n\"We are shocked by the allegation of 'fraudulent intent' made by the insured and hereby rebut it all. We value this responsibility and hereby tender the facts of the claim for clarity:\n\n\u201cWe confirm that Mr. Jolayemi Woleola is the holder of a comprehensive motor insurance policy with our company on his Mercedes Benz with registration number RBC 123 BL. He insured his vehicle for the sum of Fifteen Million Naira (N15,000,000.00) and the policy was effective 26th April, 2021 upon payment of Three Hundred and Seventy-Five Thousand Naira (N375,000.00) being the total premium on the policy.\n\n\u201cOn the 7th of June, 2021, barely two (2) months from the inception of the policy, the insured lodged a claim for a damage to the windscreen and front headlight of the insured vehicle and submitted a quotation of Three Million, Six Hundred and Sixty- Nine Thousand, Two Hundred and Seventy-Four Naira, Ninety-Three Kobo (N3,669,274.93). Upon receipt of the claim, we engaged an independent loss adjuster who adjusted the claim to One Million, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira (N1, 250,000.00). The insured accepted our settlement offer and we paid the adjusted sum to the insured on the 24th June, 2021.\n\n\u201cOn the 13th of August, 2021, barely two months after the initial claim and about four months into the policy, the insured lodged another claim following an accident involving the same insured vehicle which he stated that he rammed into a moving trailer. He presented a quotation of Thirteen Million, Four Hundred and Forty-Three Thousand, Nine Hundred and Eighty-Two Naira, Seventy-Seven Kobo (N13,443,982.77) being the cost of repair of his Mercedes Benz E300. As usual, we engaged an independent loss adjuster who adjusted the claim to Three Million, Seven Hundred and Sixty-Nine Thousand, Nine Hundred and Forty-One Naira, Fifty- Six Kobo (N3,769,941.56).\n\n\u201cOn the 10th of September, we communicated a formal net offer of the sum of Three Million, Seven Hundred and Eleven Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-Five Naira, Nine Kobo (N3,711,955.09) and forwarded discharge form for cash in lieu of repairs, given that the insured appeared to want to write off the vehicle despite it being repairable.\n\n\u201cThe Insured rejected our offer, insisting that we should settle him on the basis of the sum insured which is contrary to the insurance principle of indemnity as we would be putting the insured in a position far better than he was immediately before the accident.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with standard policy terms, an insurance company can either 'repair, reinstate, or replace' the damaged vehicle. The choice is solely dependent on the professional assessment of the extent of damage. It is also worthy to note that where an accident results in a loss with repair value in excess of 55% of the Sum Insured Value of the vehicle, it is treated as a 'constructive total loss', entitling the insurer to pay for replacement of the vehicle and the possession of the salvage (i.e., the damaged insured vehicle). In this case, the cost of repair was 25.1% of the Sum Insured Value of N15m, which is far less than 55%.\n\n\u201cThe demand and insistence of the insured to claim full value of the insured vehicle appeared to be fraudulent, leading us to investigate why he wants to profit from insurance, particularly after the first accident with a similarly inflated claim that we allowed despite our reservations about it.\n\nSee Also News Customer Accuses Leadway Assurance Company Of Fraud Over Multi-million Naira Claims On Damaged Vehicle\n\n\u201cIn the course of our investigation, we discovered that the insured had purchased the vehicle as an accident vehicle via auction with primary damage to the front end, secondary damage to the right front and other internal issues which the insured had fraudulently concealed from the insurer at the point of taking up the policy.\n\n\u201cFrom the second accident, the insured in his quotation included some vehicle parts which had been damaged at the time he purchased the accident vehicle and prior to the second accident claimed by him. Rather than deny his second claim altogether, we accepted the dodgy fact of a moving trailer, superficial injury following this moving trailer story and still made an offer on parts that could have been damaged, assuming his story to be true.\n\nPlease note that we remain reputable for our payment of genuine claims and hold ourselves to high standards of best practices.\n\n\u201cThis is evident in Mr. Jolayemi Woleola\u2019s claim that was settled earlier in the year and our net offer of Three Million, Seven Hundred and Eleven Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-Five Naira, Nine Kobo (N3,711,955.09) less policy deductions, being the independently adjusted cost of repairs for his alleged damaged vehicle from an accident with a moving trailer.\n\n\u201cWe kindly request that you retract your publication by publishing our facts and also circulate to counter the fraudulent use of your media in an attempt to blackmail us on an entitlement that is not due to the insured. This would also help in educating and enlightening the public on insurance matters.\u201d",

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis, and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad, or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria, is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole, than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in app integrations. But, as none of these payment aps are widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalaskasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller micro transactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest growing economies in sub-saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jumia records all-time high quarterly orders and unveils its fintech ambition",
          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Shuttlers raises $1.6 million to expand to Nigerian cities",
          "text": "Shuttlers, a logistics startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into African countries.\n\nThe investment round was led by VestedWorld, a Chicago-and-Africa-based investment firm, with Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, Sakore, and Nikky Taurus also participating in the raise.\n\nWith its new raise, Shuttlers intends to try its wheels in more Nigerian cities before expanding beyond the borders of the country into other African countries.\n\nShuttling Lagos\u2019 transportation system\n\nIn 2016, Damilola Olokesusi founded Shuttlers to tackle the inefficient transportation system in Lagos, Africa\u2019s most populous city. The startup was a tech-enabled bus-sharing company targeted at helping Lagosians commute in comfort at affordable rates.\n\nAt the time, Lagos was a city holding 23 million people and 90% of its transport system was road-based, with semi-formal mini buses or danfos accounting for 45% of trips while walking accounted for 40%. According to the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority in 2015, the city alone also accounted for 30% of the total number of road vehicles in Nigeria, with a vehicular density of 234 cars per kilometre.\n\nAlthough Lagos has a number of federal roads, its transport system is epileptic due to the poor nature of some of the roads and the lack of a formal or public transport system which accounts for only 2.5% of the system.\n\nShuttlers\u2019 solution\n\nAt launch, Shuttlers did not have a mobile app.\n\nThe company\u2019s model at the time was messenger-based, using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate routes and timelines to its customers. One of their very first clients was Andela, which took advantage of the startup\u2019s B2B2C option to ferry its workers across the state.\n\nBy 2019, Shuttlers revamped to introduce a mobile app where customers could subscribe to any of the three plans available, which includes a B2B where business clients pay the total fares of their employees, and B2C where individual customers pay fares themselves.\n\nPresently, the platform offers additional features including live bus tracking, digital payments and an on-trip menu.\n\nAlthough the company has only managed to raise about $6,000 in angel investments and grants, Shuttlers\u2019 route has been lauded with immense growth as the company claims to have over 10,000 users across its web and mobile-based platforms. With over 100 buses and 300 bus stops in Lagos, Shuttlers also claims to have recorded over 2 million trips since its inception in 2013.\n\nMoving forward\n\nFor CEO Damilola Olokesusi, the raise validates the hard work her team has put in for the past five years. Olokesusi also believes that it\u2019s an encouraging nod for female entrepreneurs in the tech space. \u201cIt shows that women can thrive in any industry they choose, especially tech which is highly male-dominated,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cI\u2019m not only a female entrepreneur, I\u2019m a huge supporter of women who are making a difference in their industries. I hope the work I do at Shuttlers inspires women to be daring with their aspirations.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also excited for the future of Shuttlers with Olokesusi at the helm. \u201cWe are very excited to back Damilola in this venture and work alongside a group of committed financial and strategic investors to scale this further,\u201d said Lavanya Anand, Principal at VestedWorld.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Shuttlers and its mission, the CEO emphasized the company\u2019s mission to transform the commuting challenges in African cities. \u201cOur mission at Shuttlers is to transform the way people commute around the world, by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are presently doing in Lagos, Nigeria. The negative impact of inefficiencies in the mobility space is visible in the quality of life, mental health, and work productivity of commuters. We also see its impact on the more vulnerable and neglected population in our society; women, children, physically challenged, and the elderly. I\u2019m confident that our smart mobility solutions can solve some of these urban mobility challenges sustainably and also reduce carbon emission.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Immediately you launch your career as an artiste and record some success, you\u2019re like a business operating and generating revenue with customers in over 70 countries. At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life. Expectedly, though, he takes on a new life when he has to match his fans\u2019 energy and excitement at shows and events.\n\nSince gaining popularity, Mr Eazi\u2019s reputation has grown in leaps and bounds, preceding him even beyond the music scene.\n\nThere was a funny moment. as we spoke. when he revealed his spontaneity and unpredictability. What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi). Source: Supplied\n\nA look at the mark the young artiste has made in a short time shows that he is clearly motivated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who is fascinated with seeing ideas come to life. There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. A mechanical engineering graduate, Oluwatosin traded FMCGs and gold before deciding to stick to music.\n\n\n\nThe rest of this article will be made public on November 23, by noon (WAT)..

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething good is a frontier; something better is also a frontier and something excellent is just another frontier! You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas. TalentQL is another one doing so via its AltSchool Africa product.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I take a loan for learning if I can guarantee that it\u2019s going to get me a job?\u201d Ogunmola asks.\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Africa\u2019s edtech industry has attracted $20 million in funding since 2019. This is not a lot of money, especially compared to investments in edtech on a global scale, which reached $18.6 billion in 2019 alone.\n\nBut Oshinaga believes we would see better investment rounds in the future. \u201cWe already have a Series A of over $5m and seed of $2-4m. This trend will continue.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, South African edtech startup, Valenture Institute, raised a $7 million Series A from GSV Ventures.\n\nIn January 2021, Nigerian edtech startup, uLesson, also raised $7 million in a Series A investment round led by Owl Ventures.\n\nThe next frontier\n\nBased on United Nations\u2019 estimates, according to Worldometer, Africa currently has a population of 1.3 billion people, with a median age of 19.7 years. This number is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2030.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, discussions about the next frontier in different sectors would be in the limelight. In anticipation of these discourses, we are talking to industry leaders, getting opinions, and seeking patterns.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to have you join us in January 2022.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe Kredi Money story\n\nOzow\u2019s $48m Series B\n\nGetting blockchain skills with Bitmama\n\nThe Kredi Money story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi Money Co-founders, Afolabi Abimbola and Samuel Orji\n\nFintech remains one of the biggest movers in Nigeria\u2019s startup ecosystem.\n\nIn 2020, Nigerian fintechs raised $439 million; that\u2019s 20% of the amount raised by all African tech startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother fintech startup, Kredi Money, has joined the Nigerian fintech space combining several fintech offerings into one.\n\nCo-Founded by Afolabi Abimbola and Samuel Orji, this fintech startup offers savings, spending, investing, lending, and insurance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and individuals.\n\nIt aims to become the one-stop-shop for all things fintech, enabling users to access fintech services from one platform\u2014sort of like a fintech super app.\n\nBut how did Abimbola and Orji get the idea for Kredi Money? Emmanuel Paul has that answer and more here: Led by ex-OPay exec, Kredi Money wants to be the one-stop-shop for payments, loans, insurance, other financial services.\n\nOzow\u2019s $48m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Pays, CEO and Co-Founder of Ozow\n\nSouth African fintech startup, Ozow has closed a $48 million Series B to ease online payments for South Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, The funding was led by Tencent, a Chinese Internet-based company. Other investors, Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund, also participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Ozow do? The startup makes it possible to pay online with bank transfers or manual Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) without using your bank app.\n\nHow? It\u2019s called automated EFT; it works just like a payment gateway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen making an online payment, customers choose Ozow as a payment option, select a bank, log in with online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment.\n\nMerchants, on the other hand, only need an account number and smartphone to receive payments.\n\nOzow\u2019s CEO, Thomas Pays, says he started the company in 2014 to create a \u201ccentral platform that could basically provide solutions to eCommerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with TechCrunch, Pays says, seven years ago, digital payment was very fragmented,\n\n\u201cif I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my eCommerce site, I need to go to a PayU.\u201d\n\nOzow plans to use the funding to expand its team from 100 to 250. A part of it will also be geared towards expansion into Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nGetting blockchain skills with Bitmama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nAccording to Statista, the blockchain technology market is currently valued at $6.92 billion. That value is expected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027. This means that as the market grows, the demand for blockchain talent will also increase.\n\nIn light of this, African crypto exchange, Bitmama, is launching Bitmama Credits Programme to support young people globally with the skills needed to get a career in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe programme will begin in the first quarter of next year, offering blockchain learning materials and internships.\n\nThe big picture: With the advent of several blockchain innovations such as Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi) and Web3, the demand for blockchain talent is climbing.\n\nIn 2019, the demand for blockchain jobs increased by 300% from the previous year.\n\nInterestingly, high demand also means huge salaries. The average salary for a blockchain developer is between $150,000 and $175,000; that\u2019s approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers.\n\nWhy\u2019s there so much demand?: According to 101 Blockchains, the need for blockchain talent is fueled by the advantages of blockchain, such as security, transparency, and traceability.\n\nWith more innovations coming out of the space, the demand for blockchain talent is bound to increase.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nGoogle\u2019s Next $1 Trillion Opportunity.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigerian singer, David Adeleke, alias Davido has said he is donating the sum of N250 million to orphanage homes across Nigeria after raising N200 million from friends on his birthday.\n\nDavido, had shared a post on his Twitter account and Instagram page on Wednesday, asking friends to gift him money, and within hours many, including Femi Otedola, Don Jazzy, Obi Cubana, M.I. Abaga, and many others, paid huge amounts of money, amounting to nearly N200 million, into his newly opened Wema Bank account, which he shared on social media.\n\nThe singer announced the decision on Saturday, saying he decided to augment the money he raised with additional N50 million and give it to orphanages across the country.\n\n\u201cI wish to express my sincere gratitude to my friends, colleagues, fans, and the public for the generous expressions of love in recent days. In my usual playful manner, I requested a few days ago that my friends and colleagues send money in celebration of my birthday,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe response and outcome exceeded my expectations, as I received about NGN 200,000,000.00 in less than two days. I truly appreciate everyone who donated hard-earned funds and I am very thankful for your generosity.\n\n\u201cI have always been passionate about giving back and helping people.\n\n\u201cIn view of this, I am delighted to announce that all the funds received, totaling NGN 200,000,000.00, will be donated to orphanages across Nigeria as well as the Paroche foundation. In addition, I will be making a personal donation of NGN 50,000,000.00, bringing the total amount to NGN250,000,000.00,\u201d he said.\n\nHe constituted a five-member committee to supervise the distribution of the money to deserving orphanages.\n\n\u201cTo oversee the distribution of funds to beneficiaries, I have established a five-person Disbursement Committee. Members of the committee include: Mrs. Titi Adebayo \u2013 chairman of the committee; Professor Jonathan Nwosu- secretary to the committee; Professor Yahana Joel Asabe of the Northern Nigeria Seventh Day Adventist Union Conference; Pastor (Dr) Oyalabu of Spring Time Development Foundation (SDF) and Professor Uloma Onuoha.\n\n\u201cThe committee will compile a list of orphanages across Nigeria. They will determine the number of children and their needs at each orphanage, and then divide the funds accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe committee will also determine the portion of the money that will be donated to Paroche foundation.\n\n\u201cTo maintain transparency, the committee will make public the names of the beneficiary orphanages and how much each will receive. A list of all beneficiaries and their verified account details will be submitted to Wema Bank, who will then be instructed to credit each beneficiary\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to do this fundraising every year to celebrate my birthday and give back to people in need. It is my hope that my friends, fans, colleagues in the industry, and the public will continue to support me as I drive this cause.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I express my sincere gratitude to my friends, colleagues, fans, and everyone that made this possible. God bless you all,\u201d he said",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s former president, Goodluck Jonathan, has said one major problem confronting the country is its inability to manage diversities, noting that democracy thrives on the mutuality of trust between government and the people and among the different groups within a state.\n\nThe former president who made the remarks at the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation\u2019s Policy Dialogue on Democracy and Unity of the State in Abuja on Friday, noted that Nigeria was going through many challenges that have continued to pose threats to its unity and corporate existence.\n\nJonathan said the country and the rest of Africa need to harness and draw strength from diversities, rather than allowing it to be a source of weakness.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, we need to harness our diversities and differences and translate them to strength for a more peaceful and prosperous future. Our diversity is often misconstrued to be the source of our challenges, but I feel if properly harnessed, it will be the source of our greatness,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\n\u201cOne good way to make progress in this regard is to strengthen government institutions to improve integration, equity and social inclusion in our various nations.\n\n\u201cLet me affirm that the weapons of our warfare in times like this should be love, justice and hope. The pursuit of these virtues will guarantee sustainable peace and unity in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhile guns, drones and other artilleries may win the war, to win the peace we need to constantly engage in meaningful conversations in order to reach compromise on issues, affecting us all.\n\nLawan moves again zoning, says president can come from anywhere\n\nSpeaking at the event, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said lack of said trust among political leaders was creating tension in the country, noting that it was also responsible for the many challenges bedevilling the nation.\n\nLawan argued that rotational presidency as being strongly being advocated in many quarters is unnecessary, as according to him, what Nigeria needs is a \u201cleader that will give sense to the people and provide everything within the constraint of resources.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President said lack of mutual trust between North and South was constituting a clog on the wheel of the country\u2019s progress, advising that Nigerians shun mutual distrust for necessary progress.\n\n\u201cWhen we have a marriage and there is mutual suspicion between the parties, that means the marriage may begin to suffer a bit. What we need is to be open as leaders to all manners of people. And we shouldn\u2019t allow suspicion among us because when political leaders allow for suspicion among themselves, the outcome is that the ethnic nationalities will behave the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur major problem is the suspicion between the different ethnic groups. Otherwise, why will someone bother where the president comes from? Let the president come from anywhere but what we need is leadership that will give sense to the people and provide everything within the constraint of resources that the people need. But when we suspect each other, that is when people crawl back to their ethnic enclaves.\u201d\n\nLawan said leaders must continue to unite and engage one another to make the country a better place, as according to him, the country could be great if the political class decides to be selfless and honest.\n\nHe described Jonathan as a man with abundant traits of humility, fairness, equity and justice, adding that, \u201cwhat you are doing as a former president is to show an example of what our leaders can do outside of the office.\u201d\n\nLawan said of Jonathan, \u201cYou are a man of peace because you believe in Nigeria and the unity of this country.\n\n\u201cAfter you left office in 2015, you decided to work for the unity of this country and its leadership to ensure that the country remains united. You are a unifier and we believe you mean well for this country.\n\n\u201cWhen you were in office, I was in the opposition but I supported many of your policies and opposed some. My belief is that you have demonstrated very clearly that this country can be great.\u201d",

          "title": "Bank Customers Lose N42.7bn In 3 Months To Social Engineering",
          "text": "Bank customers lost a whopping N42.755 billion to fraudulent activities perpetrated through social engineering in just three months, data obtained by LEADERSHIP Sunday have shown.\n\nSocial engineering is when fraudsters trick individuals to reveal personal data that could be used to access their bank accounts.\n\nIn the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic and the months following, many Nigerians were and are still being defrauded mainly thorough social engineering.\n\nWith increasing penetration of fraudsters into the banks\u2019 database, experts have warned Nigerians to avoid releasing sensitive information to strangers.\n\nThis is as some customers believe that staff of banks also collude with these fraudsters to release sensitive information with which they use in perpetrating their heinous crimes.\n\nData from the Nigeria Inter Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) showed that social engineering is still a preferred and successful technique employed by fraudsters, as a total of 11,589 cases were reportedly carried out using various social engineering techniques, resulting in N42.755 billion fraud loss value for Q3,2020. This represented 68 per cent of the entire fraud volume and value for the third quarter of 2020.\n\nAlthough, LEADERSHIP Sunday investigation revealed a rapid increase in the spate of calls from fraudsters claiming to be bank staff with the motive to get sensitive information that could give them access to victims\u2019 accounts, there are strong indications that some bank workers partake in this racket by selling sensitive information of customers to these fraudsters for a fee.\n\nExperts however believe that while few of the fraudsters have insider links in the banks, a majority of them rely mainly on information gotten from people\u2019s mobile phones, especially, stolen ones, or from websites in which bank customers may have done one transaction or the other, hence, revealing certain sensitive information that could be useful for fraudsters to pounce.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday learnt that the fraudsters trick Nigerians by pretending to be staff of a bank, and ask for some details that will give them access to customers\u2019 bank account; once they succeed in getting the information, they withdraw almost all the funds in there.\n\nSo, when fraudsters call bank customers and read their bank verification number (BVN), their full names and date of birth, many believe that they are being called from their banks and give out other sensitive information such as the two-factor authentication code that allows a successful diversion of the customer\u2019s fund.\n\nMany Nigerians have been defrauded this way and there has not been anyone who takes responsibility for the funds that have been stolen in this regard.\n\nWhile banks, in this circumstance, always insist that the customer would have compromised his or her bank details for the fraud to have been successfully carried out, customers accuse the banks of leaking out information or collaborating with the fraudsters.\n\nOne opportunity that fraudsters leveraged on last year was through the several government social intervention funds aimed at relieving the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Nigerians, to rob them of their funds.\n\nThey had sent messages via WhatsApp and text telling people to fill a form to be a recipient of some of the funds being disbursed.\n\nSimilarly, the federal government N-Power website was cloned as individuals filled out sensitive information on phoney websites. An individual lost more than N1 million to fraudsters within hours of filling out his details such as BVN, full name, date of birth and home address, alongside other details on the cloned website.\n\nAccording to data from NIBSS, attempted fraud value rose by 44 per cent in the third quarter of 2020 compared to Q3 2019, while actual loss value for Q3 2020 rose by 500 percent compared to Q3 2019.\n\nIn Q3, 2019, there was 10,692 attempted fraud cases with a value of N1.09 billion while actual loss was N552 million. The figure, however, rose to 16,988 attempted fraud cases with a value of N3.5 billion of which actual loss to fraudsters was N3.35 billion.\n\nWhile noting that there have been a few cases of bad eggs within the system who collaborate with the fraudsters,\n\nthe director of corporate communications of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Osita Nwanisobi, pointed out that most bank customers in one way or the other compromise their data.\n\nAccording to him, most individuals store their bank details such as account number and bank name as well as BVN on their phone which can be easily accessible by anyone who has access to the phone.\n\n\u201cMost of the time we give them the information. I have been hearing the stories and the reality is that we give the information. When some of these criminals are caught and they begin to tell how they do these things, we know that we give them the information.\n\n\u201cThey tell you that all they need is your phone or your simcard and once they are able to get your sim card, it is possible to get some of these things. I am not discountenancing that even in the system, we still have some bad eggs, and it is very possible that some of them might connive, but the reality is that often times we give the information,\u201d Osita stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen LEADERSHIP Sunday spoke with some bank customers, it was discovered that many store their BVN and account numbers in their contacts list which makes it easy for anyone to be able to have access to them.\n\nAsides this, Osita noted that Nigerians also put out sensitive data when they input their details on suspicious websites.\n\nOn his part, group head, Payment Solutions, Unified Payment Services Limited, James Agada, said in most cases, there has to be a hole which the fraudsters have access to before those frauds can be successful.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the fraudsters will not tell the truth about how they operate and the customers will not tell the truth about how they safeguard their credentials.\n\n\u201cAs a customer, if you have in your phone your account number, you put your BVN and all your details and your phone is stolen, someone can access it; sometimes, it is very simple: they steal your phone, they copy your data and then use it.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria two-factor authentication is mandatory, so for someone to be able to do this he has to redirect your two-factor authentication to your phone which he is holding. If he is holding your phone, it is possible to come in and request a change or do some other thing.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have your phone but has collaborators in the bank, it is possible for them to work together with the collaborators and momentarily divert the two-factor authentication to their phone; they do the transaction and divert it back and you get the notification.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some have accused the road-side business centres who help individuals do the National Identity Number (NIN) registration as being farms where fraudsters harvest data from.\n\nAlthough the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) does not list the BVN as a requisite for NIN registration, some of the centres, it was gathered, request for it and an operator of such a centre told LEADERSHIP Sunday that with the technological advancement and the orientation of most of the youths in the country presently, it cannot be ruled out that some individuals\u2019 data can be copied at these centres.\n\nHowever, he said, the two-factor authentication as provided by the bank ensures that the customer is protected and as long as the customer does not provide the fraudster with the code as sent by the bank, the fraud cannot be successful.\n\nWhen asked the role of banks in this racket, the president, Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and other Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI), Comrade Oyinkan Olasanoye, linked most fraudulent activities in banks to casualisation, saying \u201cbecause of the poor conditions of service, most of workers in banks divulges information to outsiders who use such as tools to defraud innocent customers.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, some innocent customers often fall victim as they are called by their names and exact BVN which they get from casual workers who felt they do not have a stake in the banks.\n\nOn how the police handle such matter, the public relations officer (PRO), Police Special Fraud Unit (SFU), Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Eyitayo Jonhson, explained that when instances of collusion by bank staff with fraudsters to defraud customers happen, the police try to address it based on available evidence.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPetition can come from either individuals or the bank itself. If the petition comes from the bank we expect the bank to have conducted some level of internal investigation and only come to us to prosecute the offender because they lack that power of prosecution. In this instance, the suspect, which may include the bank official, will be arrested and prosecuted, after investigation.\u201d\n\nWhile warning Nigerians to be watchful on how and who they release their sensitive information to, he said some of these fraud cases were due to the negligence of the customer itself whereby they divulge information such as PIN and token on phone when a supposed bank official calls.\n\nEyitayo advised customers to approach the fraud unit of the police when they sense foul play on their accounts, especially, when it has to do with the negligence of the bank,\n\nCustomers, he advised, must have the phone number of their account officers, as it would be useful whenever they notice illegal transactions on their accounts, before all their deposits are withdrawn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate most customers don\u2019t have the contacts of their account officers. This is crucial to stop further transactions on their bank immediately unauthorised withdrawals are made. Thereafter, they can now visit the bank on the next working day and lodge an official complaint.\n\n\u201cHowever, when the bank refuses to do the needful, then they (customers) can reach out to law enforcement agents, like the SFU or any fraud unit for redress,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s announcement that he will examine the petition of some Southeast leaders to free Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has elicited mixed reactions.\n\nDuring a meeting with Buhari at the State House in Abuja, Southeast leaders under the auspices of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic politician and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, appealed for Kanu\u2019s release.\n\nInstead of resorting to military force, Amaechi called with the president to pursue political solutions in Kanu\u2019s issue.\n\nBuhari, who pledged to review their petition, responded by stating that Kanu\u2019s unconditional release would be in violation of the idea of separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary.\n\nThe president also emphasized his non-interference approach with the judiciary.\n\nHowever, a constitutional lawyer, Maduabuchi Idam, contested the president\u2019s claim that ordering Kanu\u2019s release would constitute meddling with the judiciary.\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s assertion, Idam noted that the Nigerian constitution allows Buhari to order Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami to drop the prosecution against Kanu.\n\nThe Abuja-based lawyer told DAILY POST that the president might order Malami to withdraw any cases against anyone, including the IPOB leader, in the national good.\n\nAccording to Idam: \u201cKindly note that if an offence is alleged to have been committed, it is the state that prosecutes the alleged offender. In this context, the state is the Presidency and that is why it is the office of the Attorney General of the Federation that prosecutes Mr. Nnamdi Kanu and those of his members on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, by virtue of Section 174 (1),(c) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as Amended, the AGF has the constitutional power to amongst others, enter a \u201cnulle prosecui\u201d ( power to discontinue a case) in favour of any person being prosecuted for any offence on behalf of the Federal Government. Similarly, the power is also available to the AG of the State with respect to State offences. See Section 211 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the above, the President of Nigeria, in the interest of the public, can direct the AGF to withdraw any case that is instituted against any one on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cBy the operation of the said provision of the constitution, the AGF has the vires to personally or through an officer in his office, walk into the court where Mr. Kanu is undergoing prosecution and apply to withdraw the charges against him and his members, and the court has no power under the constitution or any law, to refuse the Application or demand the AGF to give an explanation for that.\n\n\u201cIf the President feels that a matter should be withdrawn from the court for public interest, all he needs to do is to direct the AGF to do the needful.\n\n\u201cI must say that I commend the courage of Mr. President for the first time, at least for saying that he will consider the request to release the IPOB Leader, Mr. Nnamdi Kanu and his members.\u201d\n\nIdam\u2019s remark was, however, countered by a Northern socio-political activist, Yaro Abdullahi, who warned on the dangers of releasing Kanu.\n\nAbdullahi warned that Kanu\u2019s release may serve as a spring board for other people to commit serious crimes and get away with it.\n\nHe pointed out that nobody in the history of Nigeria has committed Kanu\u2019s kind of crime; hence releasing him would be sending the wrong message.\n\n\u201cHow do you start considering the release of a criminal like Kanu, who ordered killing of people. Because of his criminal style of agitation, the Southeast is no longer peaceful, releasing him would be sending the wrong signal that people can just do anything and get away with it.\n\n\u201cThis is my view. The president should allow the judiciary to do their work and not listen to all those appeals. If the courts find him guilty, he should face the music and if it\u2019s the other way round, he should be released.\n\n\u201cThe president, while considering should also note the damage Kanu is capable of doing if set free,\u201d he told DAILY POST.",

Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke gave the Order pursuant to an application filed by the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe Commission had told the court that the management of Sterling Bank Plc, where the account was domiciled had acknowledged the existence of the said account with the staggering sum of N19, 333,333,333.36 in its books.\n\n\u201cThe Commission further brought to the attention of the court that \u201cThe sum of N19, 333,333,333.36 is still standing in the credit of the account frozen\u201d, adding that \u201cthe management of Sterling Bank PIc, has, pursuant to a letter dated 15 September, 2021, signed by its Managing Director, indicated intention to return the total sum of N19, 333,333,333.36 back to the Central Bank of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EFCC prayed The court that it \u201cis expedient for the instant suit to be discontinued and the account unfrozen to enable the management of Sterling Bank PIc effect the transfer/ return of the sum of the sum of N19, 333, 333, 333.36 back to the coffer of the Central Bank of Nigeria , where the said bailout funds was disbursed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe transfer has put paid to any further controversy regarding source and ownership of the funds and most importantly, aborted the funds dissipation.\n\n\u201cOn August 31, 2021, Justice Tijani Garba Ringim, a vacation Judge, had ordered the freezing of the account, following an ex-parte application filed by the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC, in a 13-paragraph affidavit in support of the ex-parte application, had stated that it received a credible and direct intelligence, which led to the tracing of the funds reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities in account No. 0073572696 domiciled in Sterling Bank, Plc with the name Kogi State Salary Bailout Account.\n\n\u201cAfter listening to the EFCC application, Justice Ringim on August 31, 2021, ordered the freezing of the account and directed the publication of the order in a national newspaper by the EFCC\u201d.",

Each of the Senegal winger\u2019s efforts were tame but Kiko Femenia managed to turn in the rebound from the first spot-kick, only for the goal to ruled out because of player encroachment from both teams.\n\nIt was not long, however, before Sarr rectified his penalty misses by sending a right-footed shot across de Gea\u2019s goal to double Watford\u2019s lead after King had opened the scoring thanks to Emmanuel Dennis\u2019 assist.\n\nA second-half uprising saw forgotten man Donny van de Beek \u2013 brought on to replace McTominay who received a yellow card \u2013 put the ball in the net from Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s knock down following England winger Jadon Sancho\u2019s searching cross.\n\nBut the nightmare continued for Solskjaer as Harry Maguire was booked twice in seven minutes and sent off.\n\nA slither of hope looked to have arrived on 77 minutes after the lively Van de Beek found Ronaldo with a through ball but the Portugal captain\u2019s goal was ruled out for offside.\n\nIn the dying moments of the game, to the delight of the loud Watford faithful, Joao Pedro and Dennis added a third and fourth for Watford to pile more heartbreak on the travelling United supporters.\n\nThe defeat means United have tumbled down the table to eighth on 17 points, while Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side are only four points behind them in 15th.",

          "text": "The Gender Perspective and Social Development Center (GPSDC), convener of Stop Violence Against Women in Politics (Stop-VAWIP), and the Catch Them Young Community Initiative (CATYCOI), promoter of Vote Not Fight Campaign (VNF), have reported 14 cases of violence meted against women at the Anambra State November 6 gubernatorial poll.\n\nAccording to the groups, the incidents of violence against women which were recorded mostly at Awka South, Ihiala and Nnewi North Local Government Areas (LGA), included threats, attempted murder, coercion, economic and psychological violences.\n\nPresenting the reports in Awka, the Anambra State capital, the Programme Manager, Stop-VAWIP, Mr Emmanuel Ubajekwe, and his counterparts of VNF, Mr Nonso Orakwe, said they trained and deployed volunteers across the three senatorial districts, 21 LGAs, 326 wards and polling units in Anambra State, as well as created media programmes for effective election monitoring and incident reporting.\n\nUbajekwe whose programmes were supported by the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) United States Agency for International Development (USAID), said the election witnessed increased women participation despite the violence experienced before and during the poll, and called on relevant stakeholders to step up actions towards forestalling future occurrences of such incidents.\n\n\u201cA total of 14 incidents were recorded. 78.6 % of the incidents occurred during the elections which lasted from Saturday 6 till Tuesday, 9 November 2021. While 21% of the incident occurred in the pre-election phase. Physical violence constitutes about 64.3% of the entire incidents. Female voters were affected by dragging or preventing them from the polling unit, threats and coercion, murder or attempted murder and intimidation of a female INEC official.\n\n\u201cAn example is the intimidation of a female INEC official in Uruagu ward 2 in Nnewi North Local Government Area on election day and sporadic shooting of guns by security agents at Aroma Junction in Awka on election day. Economic violence constituted about 28.6% of the total number of recorded incidents of violence against women. This could be seen through reported cases of vote-buying and selling that took place during the polls. Psychological violence constituted only 7.1 % of the total number of recorded incidents, notably false accusation.\n\n\u201cThe incidence of violence by Local Government Area (LGA) showed that Awka South and Nnewi North recorded the highest cases of electoral violence at 21.4% each while Ayamelum and Ihiala followed with 14.3% each. Awka North, Njikoka, and Ogbaru recorded the least at 7.1 % each. The incidence of electoral violence by gender showed that women were the most targeted during the election (42.1%) and men the least (26.3%). The forms of physical violence recorded showed murder or attempted murder at the top (57.1%) while other forms such as intimidation of INEC officials; the sporadic shooting by security agents, threats (coercion) formed 28.6% of the total incidence.\n\n\u201cDragging and preventing a person from polling units recorded the least at 14.3% of the recorded cases. The only form of psychological violence recorded was false accusation (100%), while the forms of economic violence recorded put vote buying/selling at 75% and economic punishment at 25%, respectively. Lastly, the analysis conducted showed that voters made up 50% of the incidents recorded, while others such as election administrators, party activists, observers and security agents made up 7% each,\u201d Ubajewe stated.\n\nThey further commended all the contestants at the poll especially those who have congratulated Prof. Charles Soludo, the candidate of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), the eventual winner of the poll, describing it as\u200b \u201chealthy spirit of sportsmanship.\u201d\u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b",

          "text": "The United States government says it hopes that Nigeria will become a strong example for world democracies when the nation heads to the polls come 2023.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Channels Television, U.S. Secretary of State, Mr Antony Blinken, said the United States anticipates an election that goes \u201csmoothly, freely and fairly, with real participation which will send a very strong message about democratic resilience\u201d.\n\nBlinken who in a recent address warned that \u2018democratic recession\u2019 is growing around the world, noted on Friday in Abuja that he is pleased with the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari is willing to respect term limits.\n\nAccording to him, respecting such a democratic principle is powerful on its own. He, however, noted that there has to be something more.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Secretary of State explained that \u201cone of the reasons that citizens are losing faith in some places, in democracy, in the institutions is because they feel that its not delivering for them. It\u2019s not actually producing things that they need, that they want, that will make a difference in their lives.\n\n\u201cSo, in different countries including in Nigeria, when everything is done based on patronage as opposed to actually delivering all the things that people need, that actually erodes trust in democracy.\n\n\u201cBut the more the government can be responsive to the needs of people, the more they will say you know what, this system works, I want to be a part of it, I want to defend it and that I think will create enthusiasm around the elections. And that alone will also send a very important message to countries through the continent and around the world.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Blinken told members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Abuja that the United States government believes now is the time for major geopolitical players across the world to start treating Africa as one of them.\n\n\u201cThe United States firmly believes that it is time to start treating Africa as a subject in geopolitics, and structure it as a major geopolitical player it has become \u2013 the facts speak for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking specifically about Nigeria, the U.S. official highlighted some of the reasons it would not be out of place to call the nation the giant of Africa.\n\nAmong several other qualities, he noted Nigeria\u2019s cultural influence, saying people across the world listen to the Afrobeat music genre and watch Nollywood movies. He, however, believes there are areas that require improvements.\n\n\u201dYour strengths are undeniable \u2013 a dynamic democracy, a robust economy, and a very powerful civil society. Challenges you face here are undeniable as well, including the disruption and insecurity caused by terrorism,\u201d said Blinken.\n\n\u201cWhat happens here in Nigeria is felt around the world, and that, in a nutshell, is why I came to Abuja. United States knows that in most of the challenges and opportunities we face, Africa will make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t achieve our goals around the world \u2013 whether ending the COVID-19 pandemic, building a strong and inclusive global economy, combating the climate crisis\u2026 without the leadership of the African governments, institutions, and citizens.\n\n\u201cCountries like Nigeria, not just global leaders, they are increasingly prominent around the world beyond this region, and they are deserving a permanent seat wherever the most consequential issues are discussed.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of State stressed the need to foster democracy across the African continent and appealed to its leaders to stop interfering with democratic processes.\n\nAlluding to the threats to democracy also in the U.S., he stated that it was important for countries in every part of the world to share best practices.\n\nBlinken also asked them to make public pledges to hold each other accountable, as well as show how democracy can deliver what citizens want quickly and effectively.",

          "text": "The UN and the United States on Friday demanded proof of Peng Shuai\u2019s whereabouts, amid rising concern for the Chinese tennis star\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nThe player has not been seen in public since alleging on November 2 that she was sexually assaulted by China\u2019s former vice-premier.\n\nTennis stars, sports bodies, governments and human rights defenders have all spoken up in support of the 35 year old who said in a now-deleted Weibo post that Zhang Gaoli had forced her to have sex.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden\u2019s administration wanted China to \u201cprovide independent, verifiable proof\u201d of Peng\u2019s whereabouts and expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the former world top-ranked doubles player.\n\nThe United Nations has insisted on a fully transparent investigation into Peng\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cIt would be important to have proof of her whereabouts and wellbeing,\u201d Liz Throssell, a spokeswoman for the UN Human Rights Office, told reporters in Geneva. \u201cWe are calling for an investigation with full transparency into her allegation of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nTennis players including Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic, the world\u2019s top men\u2019s player, have also voiced their support for the Chinese athlete.\n\n\u201cThis is horrifying. I mean, a person is missing,\u201d Djokovic said at the ATP Finals in the Italian city of Turin. \u201cThe whole tennis community needs to back her up and her family and make sure that she is safe and sound.\u201d\n\nDjokovic also backed the Women\u2019s Tennis Association\u2019s (WTA) statement that it was prepared to cut lucrative business ties with China over Peng.\n\n\u201cIf you have tournaments on Chinese soil without resolving this situation it would be a little bit strange, so I understand why the WTA has taken a stance like that,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\nThe former Wimbledon and French Open doubles champion alleged that Zhang, who retired in 2018, had \u201cforced\u201d her to have sex during a long-term on-off relationship.\n\nChina has remained largely silent over the tennis star and on Friday the Foreign Ministry stuck to its line that it was not aware of the controversy surrounding the player.\n\nMinistry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that the matter was \u201cnot a diplomatic question and I\u2019m not aware of the situation.\u201d\n\nPeng\u2019s post was quickly deleted from her verified account on Weibo, China\u2019s popular social media platform, although screenshots of the accusation were shared widely. Discussion of the case has since been suppressed, with state broadcaster CGTN this week sharing an email purportedly from Peng to WTA chief Steve Simon saying that she was \u201cresting\u201d at home and the assault allegation was \u201cnot true\u201d.\n\nSimon has questioned the authenticity of the email, and on Friday said the WTA was at a \u201ccrossroads\u201d with China and continuing all efforts to reach out and speak to Peng directly.\n\nPeng, who represented China in the Beijing, London and Rio de Janeiro Olympics, is not the first high profile Chinese citizen to suddenly disappear from public view in unclear circumstances.\n\nJack Ma, the founder of the world\u2019s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba, went missing in October 2020 after criticising government regulators in a speech. Shortly afterwards, a significant share sale by Ant Group, the group\u2019s online payments unit, was pulled by the authorities at the last minute. Ma re-emerged in a video in January this year, but did not mention his disappearance.\n\nFan Bingbing, a Hollywood actress who was a prolific social media user, disappeared for three months in 2018. It later emerged that she was kept under house arrest while she was investigated for tax evasion.\n\nPeng\u2019s claims brought the #MeToo movement into the highest echelons of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government has systematically silenced the country\u2019s #MeToo movement,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s China researcher Doriane Lau.\n\n\u201cGiven that it also has a zero-tolerance approach to criticism, it is deeply concerning that Peng Shuai appears to be missing,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden has said he is angry after a teenager who shot dead two men during racial unrest last year in Wisconsin was cleared by a court.\n\nThe president expressed dismay at the verdict in a written statement although earlier he said he stood by the jury.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, 18, sobbed as he was acquitted of all charges over the shooting in Kenosha on 25 August 2020.\n\nThere were low-key protests over the outcome of the trial that has divided the US.\n\nMr Rittenhouse had acknowledged fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and injuring Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, but maintained he did so in self-defence.\n\nThe former police youth cadet was cleared of two counts of intentional homicide, one count of attempted homicide and two counts of recklessly endangering safety.\n\nMr Rittenhouse appeared to nearly collapse with relief as he learned his fate on Friday from a jury of seven women and five men after three-and-a-half days of deliberations. His mother, Wendy, also wept.\n\nThe defendant and the men he shot were all white, but the issue of race hung over the case because the shooting happened during civil disorder over perceived police brutality.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s election campaign, Mr Biden tweeted a video that appeared to link Rittenhouse, without any evidence, to white supremacists.\n\nOn Friday outside the White House a reporter asked the Democratic president whether he stood by his past comments about the teenager.\n\nMr Biden said he had only just heard the news and added: \u201cI stand by what the jury has concluded. The jury system works and we have to abide by it.\u201d\n\nHe later released a statement saying: \u201cWhile the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken.\u201d\n\nMr Rittenhouse, then 17, had showed up in Kenosha after the city had been convulsed by two nights of rioting, looting and arson when police shot a black man, Jacob Blake, seven times in the back on 23 August 2020, leaving him partially paralysed.\n\nThe defence presented their client as a civic-minded teenager who had gone to the Midwestern US city to protect private property and only shot the men because he was in fear of his life.\n\nThe prosecution had depicted Mr Rittenhouse as a reckless vigilante and the men he shot as heroes attempting to disarm someone they thought was an \u201cactive shooter\u201d.\n\nThe trial heard that Mr Rosenbaum had been acting erratically that night and chased Mr Rittenhouse before trying to grab his gun. Mr Rittenhouse fatally shot him.\n\nMr Huber was then killed after striking Mr Rittenhouse in the head or neck with a skateboard.\n\nMr Grosskreutz had his bicep shot off after pointing his own gun at Mr Rittenhouse.\n\nAfter the verdict, Mr Rittenhouse\u2019s defence attorney Mark Richards said of his client: \u201cHe wants to get on with his life.\n\n\u201cHe wishes none of this ever happened. But as he said when he testified, he did not start this.\u201d\n\nThe parents of Huber, the second person shot, said they were \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the verdict.\n\n\u201cIt sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,\u201d Karen Bloom and John Huber said in a statement.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Nomia Iqbal in Kenosha said a small number of protesters gathered outside the court, holding signs that read \u201cKiller Kyle,\u201d and \u201cNo justice no peace.\u201d\n\nLocal store owners told her they would be glad once the verdict was announced so that the city could move forward.\n\nThe trial exposed political divisions, with many Democrats condemning the verdict while Republicans said justice had been served, with some even offering him internships.\n\nFollowing the verdict, right-wing Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted a clip of an exclusive interview with Mr Rittenhouse, to be broadcast on Monday.\n\nIn the footage, Mr Rittenhouse describes waking up in a cold sweat because of \u201cscary\u201d dreams he has every night about what happened.",
