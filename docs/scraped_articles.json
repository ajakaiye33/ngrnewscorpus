          "text": "A former Director of the Department of State Services, Mike Ejiofor, says the de-proscription of the Indigenous People of Biafra as a terrorist organisation will pave the way for dialogue and amicable solution to the crisis engulfing the South-Eastern part of the country.\n\nEjiofor stated this in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH on Monday.\n\nHe also said the people of the zone complied with IPOB\u2019s sit-at-home order probably because they feared being caught up in a crossfire between state security agents and operatives of IPOB\u2019s Eastern Security Network.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that commercial activities came to a standstill on Monday in Imo, Anambra, Enugu, Abia, and Ebonyi States as residents deserted public places in compliance with IPOB\u2019s sit-at-home order.\n\nIPOB, through its Director of Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, had said human and vehicular movement would be restricted across the South-East on Monday to mark the 54th anniversary of Biafra.\n\nCommenting on the development, Ejiofor said, \u201cPeople comply with the lockdown out of fear. People are afraid of both the military and IPOB, they are afraid of the consequences of coming out. There could be a clash between IPOB and security forces and the people might be caught in a crossfire. So, the best thing to do is to stay at home.\u201d\n\nThe South-East has been a theatre of violence of late as rampaging gunmen unleash unprintable and unprecedented mayhem on the five states in the geopolitical zone. Just this year, the hoodlums have burned down scores of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission, police stations and other government structures in the zone.\n\nAsked whether the growing insecurity in the zone will affect the 2023 elections, the former DSS director said, \u201cUntil we get there but the government should find a way of resolving this issue before the election.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the government cannot engage a terrorist organisation. IPOB has been classified as a terrorist organsation. The government should look for a political solution by de-proscribing IPOB and engaging them in dialogue.\n\n\u201cBut not only IPOB, the government should also engage the leaders in the South-East. This will kind of douse tension because there is so much tension in the land. This is a political problem that requires a political solution. If we continue to flex muscles \u2013 IPOB on one side, the government on the other side \u2013 the citizens will suffer because when two elephants fight, the grass suffer \u2013 the citizens will suffer both economically and politically.\u201d\n\nThe regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had in September 2017 outlawed IPOB and declared that the activities of the secessionist group constituted an act of terrorism and illegality.\n\nBefore then, the leader of the group, Nnamdi Kanu, was arrested and jailed but was later released from the Kuje Prison in Abuja after meeting bail conditions. The IPOB leader later fled the country and has been operating from overseas.",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Chidi Nkwopara\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has lamented over what he called \u201cthe thoughtless and reckless\u201d murder of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak.\n\nUzodimma also sympathized with the families of those who lost their lives, through stray bullets during this period.\n\nThe Governor, who made his feelings known at a press conference in Owerri, said: \u201cAs you know, the death of anyone diminishes mankind. But the brutal and callous assassination of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak, Sunday, May 30, 2021, on his way to the Sam Mbakwe Cargo Airport, is painful because he did not deserve to die that way.\n\n\u201cThe death of this compatriot is a personal loss to me because he was an invaluable friend and brother, whose sense of justice, fairness and uprightness endeared him to me. I was shocked to my marrows when the sad news of his callous murder was broken to me.\n\n\u201cI was getting ready to go to church when the sad news came and I could not attend the service again. It was simply one of the most devastating news I have had in my life and I am yet to recover from the shock. It remains a puzzle to me, why anyone would want to murder him in this gruesome and vicious manner.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Ahmed Gulak was in Imo State, for a national assignment. He came to Owerri with the Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendment. Being a humble man, he chose to travel incognito, according to his friend who was with him. Someone must have trailed him from the hotel to the airport. That is exactly why his gruesome murder appears to be a clear case of political assassination.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports by the police, he was shot in cold blood and the assailants did not remove a pin from him. It is most benumbing that people chose to waste such an innocent blood in such a dastardly and cowardly manner.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Uzodimma made it clear that everything would be done by security agencies, to find those who murdered Gulak and their sponsors, stressing that they will not escape their deserved punishment.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is not in our character as Ibos, not in our tradition nor in our culture. We must condemn this callous act. I will urge everybody to exercise restraint and allow the police to continue with their investigations, which I understand is already yielding positive results as some arrests have already been made. I commend the police for their speed so far in handling this case.\n\n\u201cIt is reassuring that the President and Commander in Chief, His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, has assured the nation that the perpetrators of this heinous crime would be apprehended and punished.\n\n\u201cOn our part as a government, we are not sparing any effort in ensuring that the murderers of this patriot are quickly arrested and prosecuted for their evil deeds.\u201d\n\nWhile saying that Imo people are very hospitable, Uzodimma also said that the events of the last few weeks does not represent who Ndigbo truly are.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe that the ongoing police investigations will uncover the whole truth; it is common knowledge that those who are innocent need not be afraid. But the guilty will never go scot-free, certainly not in this instant case.\n\n\u201cLet me also through this medium commiserate with relations and families of victims of kidnapping, armed robberies, banditry and stray bullets in Imo state and to inform you that the government has been reaching out and will continue to reach out to all other victims.\n\n\u201cMay I on behalf of my family, the government and the good people of Imo state convey my heartfelt condolences to the immediate family of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak, the government and the people of Adamawa state and the families of our brothers and sisters in Imo state who lost their lives during this period.\n\n\u201cFinally, let me also clarify the story trending on the social media platforms, that my convoy was attacked, my convoy was never attacked. That is the wish of those who murdered Gulak.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "By Sanni Onogu, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has summoned Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume, over the alleged failure of lottery operators in the country to remit revenues to the Federation Account.\n\nChairman, Senate Committee on Sports, Senator Obinna Ogba, stated this after his panel met with the lottery operators and the regulatory agencies handling their affairs.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan had last month asked the panel to conduct an investigation into the alleged loss of hundreds of billions of naira it should be generating from lottery proceeds annually.\n\nThe directive followed a debate on a motion moved at plenary by Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, who also called on the Senate to probe the non-execution of terms of settlement between the Nigerian Lottery Regulatory Commission and one of the lottery firms, Ghana Games in Nigeria.\n\nThere was however a mild drama at the committee\u2019s session when representatives of Western Lotto and Premier Lotto clashed at the event.\n\nWestern Lotto, which claimed it has the franchise to run the Ghana Games in Nigeria, was established by the late Senator Buruji Kashamu while the Premier Lotto, which is challenging the claim, is believed to be owned by Chief Kessington Adebutu, popularly known as Baba Ijebu.\n\nTrouble started when the Managing Director of Western Lotto Company, Mr. Olumide Adedeji, informed the Committee and the management of the regulatory agencies his firm had relevant franchise documents from the Ghana Lottery Commission as its main representative in Nigeria.\n\nHe claimed the NLRC has failed to implement the terms of the agreement to set up the Ghana Games Lottery Commission in Nigeria so that his firm would be earning its due commission.\n\nThe Managing Director of Premier Lotto, Mr. Ajibola Adebutu, asked the Red Chamber to disregard the claims of the rival lottery agency.\n\nAdebutu said granting such a request would make the Western Lotto, an operator, to be a regulator as well.\n\nAttempts by Adedeji to explain the NLRC would be the main regulator of the proposed Ghana Games Commission was resisted by Adebutu and the situation led to a stalemate which forced the panel to meet behind closed doors.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the session, Ogba said the meeting was inconclusive behind the closed door.\n\nHe said the committee had decided to summon the Minister of Special Duties and the NLRC board members to resolve the contentious issue next Monday.\n\nHe also said Akume would be expected to tell the Senate why the South-East and the South-South geopolitical zones were not represented on the board of the NLRC.\n\nREAD ALSO: Imo begins enforcement against illegal lottery operators\n\nSenator Ogba said: \u201cThe issue was not finally resolved. Our interest is to ensure that the Federal Government generates revenue into its purse.\n\n\u201cAll over the World, the lottery is an avenue to generate revenue. What we discovered is that the country is not getting much revenue from the lottery operators.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, the operators are also saying that they have been paying a lot of money to the government.\n\n\u201cIn fact, one of the operators, Bet Naija claimed that he paid N18billion to the Federal Government coffers in the last three months. We want to find out where these monies have gone to. We want to find out.\n\n\u201cAbout the Ghana Games, some operators are scared that the operators should not play the role of a regulator.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved that all monies generated should go to the Federal Government directly. It is now the Federal Government that will determine who has the franchise and pay him the percentage due to him.\n\n\u201cThe Committee has adjourned till Monday and we have invited the board of the lottery commission. We are also inviting the Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume.\n\n\u201cWe will also raise the issue of the non- representatives of the South-East and South-South on the board of the lottery agency.\n\n\u201cIt is Mr President that constitutes the board so we will ask the minister to communicate to the executive that it had contravened the Act that established the commission for not including the South-East and South-South geopolitical zones on the board.\u201d",

The declaration of Biafra independence by General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu must always stand,\u201d he said.\n\nThis came as the various police commands threatened to crush any form of procession or gathering relating to Biafra today.\n\nIn Onitsha, tension started building up on Saturday, May 29, following an alleged shooting of soldiers at Ihiala Local Government Area of the state by suspected gunmen which caused gridlock for hours at the Onitsha bridgehead due to tight security check there.\n\nThere was show-of-force patrol by joint-security forces along roads and streets of Onitsha and its environs, ostensibly to instil fear in anybody trying to cause breach of peace and breakdown of law and order.\n\nWithin the week, there was rush by people to the markets to make purchases and stock foodstuff due to fear of unknown during the exercise.\n\nAnnouncements were made in various churches in Onitsha during the services, advising worshippers to obey the sit-at-home order today to avoid any possible attack or being hit by stray bullets.\n\nAttendance in many churches was scanty due to fear, as many people assumed the sit-at-home started yesterday as it used to.\n\nChairman of Onitsha Main Market Association, Kenneth Onyeka, said the market will remain open for business.\n\nOne of the traders, Johnson Dikemba, told Daily Sun that for the past few years when Biafra Day was marked, the major markets in the Onitsha shut down to respect their fathers, grandfathers and mothers who lost their lives during the civil war.\n\nDecide what you want, Umahi tells residents\n\nEbonyi Governor, David Umahi, yesterday, seemingly recanted as he asked residents of the state to feel free to participate in the sit-at-home exercise if they so wished.\n\nThe governor had, on a statewide broadcast on Saturday evening to mark his six years in office, directed Ebonyi people to go about their normal businesses today.\n\nUmahi also said he had withdrawn his earlier threat to punish any trader who closed his shop in obedience to the order, saying it was within the rights of anyone to sit at home.\n\nHis Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze, who addressed a press conference in Abakaliki, yesterday, said: \u201cEbonyi government has received several requests from some families and residents of the state, requesting they would like to remain indoors today to organise private family prayers in honour of their loved ones who were murdered during the civil war. Some of the people with this special request own shops in some of our markets across the state.\n\n\u201cWhile as a government, we remain resolute in the protection of lives and property of Ebonyians and all residents of Ebonyi State, we are aware that it is the right of anyone to remain at home or go about his/her normal businesses in this regard.\n\n\u201cFollowing the foregoing, Governor Umahi, who is highly in touch with the people has directed that those who may wish to remain at home with their shop(s) locked should neither be penalised, nor their shop(s) seized as it is their constitutional right while the rights of those who may wish to go about their normal businesses should not be infringed upon as it is equally their constitutional right.\u201d\n\nAnambra, Imo, Enugu, Abia set for sit-at-home\n\nIn Anambra, preparations for the sit-at-home appeared to have started on Saturday as there was panic buying by the residents of the state. Many residents thronged the markets to buy food stuffs that would last them till Tuesday.\n\nFood stuff markets all opened yesterday for business as those returning from churches were also seen stopping over to buy food items.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command said it was adequately prepared to ensure there would be no breakdown of law and order in the state.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, told Daily Sun: \u201cWe are not deterred by the speculations but the command is concentrating on our mandate of protecting lives and property.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, said: \u201cAs far as we are concerned, today (yesterday) is the anniversary of the creation of Biafra. And Anambra State Government, in 2016, became the first and only administration in history to honour the memory of those who died in the fight for freedom.\n\n\u201cAmong the people who attended the solemn ceremony at Ekwueme Square was Alex Ekwueme, Nigeria\u2019s first vice president. So, tomorrow (today) is not a public holiday.\u201d\n\nAsked if the civil service and schools would open today, he responded with a question: \u201cDid you hear that the government is closing down any school or declaring a public holiday or work free day? Tomorrow is just another day.\u201d\n\nAs at late yesterday evening, Imo residents appeared set to comply with the order IPOB order.\n\nRoads were getting completely deserted while most shops which normally opened on Sundays remained locked.\n\nAlso, many churches in the urban areas witnessed low turnout of worshipers while those that managed to hold services hurriedly closed.\n\nHowever, the police had assured residents of their safety, noting they had activated every tactical means to make sure no lives or property would be lost in the state today.\n\nSimilarly, a wave of uncertainty enveloped Enugu State, yesterday, ostensibly because of recent security threats.\n\nSo, many residents said they would like to stay indoors today to avoid unpleasant incidents.\n\nSome who are Federal Government workers said they would watch out first before taking any action, \u201cnow that the Federal Government facilities are targets.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu, warned anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions to disrupt the relative peace and security enjoyed in the state, to desist forthwith, as such attempt would be vehemently resisted.\n\nHowever, residents of Abia State have braced up for the exercise even as police called on the people to ignore the order.\n\nMost residents of the state already see today as a public holiday as they bought most of what they would use on Monday, on Friday and Saturday.\n\nIn some churches across the state, yesterday, adherents were asked to remain at home as not to be victims of any clash between security agents and Biafra agitators.\n\nCommercial vehicle and tricycle operators spoken to said they would be off the streets in compliance with the order.\n\nAlthough, the state government did not issue order for closure of markets, some traders, who spoke to Daily Sun, said they would stay at home to avoid any trouble.\n\nDeal with troublemakers \u2013Delta CP\n\nCommissioner of Police in Delta, Ari Muhammed Ali, yesterday, urged his officers to deal decisively with troublemakers in any part of the state.\n\nAli warned that on no account should anybody be seen carrying or hoisting Biafra flag in whatever guise in the state.\n\nHis warning is coming on the heels of the sit-at-home order for today by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAli, in a statement, yesterday, by the acting Public Relations Officer of the command, Bright Edafe, said undercover police detectives have been deployed across the state to arrest anyone caught carrying Biafra flag, and ensure they are dealt with accordance with the law of the land.",

          "text": "By Doris Obinna\n\nThe Lagos State Government has said that new Coronavirus Act of 2021 empowers Mr. Governor to sanction erring individuals with fines of up to N500,000 and/or imprisonment of up to five years.\n\nCommissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, said the act empowers the state to quarantine anyone deemed fit and for any period of time.\n\nIn a statement, yesterday, the commissioner said the state is going to follow to the letter laid sanctions by Lagos State House of Assembly, which is also implemented by the Attorney General of the state.\n\nAbayomi said: \u201cWhilst the state has gone through great lengths to provide a seamless experience for passengers, it is important that the passengers adhere strictly to the laid-out protocols to avoid sanctions which may include penalties and/or prison time as laid out.\n\n\u201cAccording to the act, providing false or deliberately misleading information when filling out the online platform is an offence punishable by one year imprisonment and/or fines according to section 17 of the coronavirus pandemic law 2021.\n\n\u201cAccording to section 17 of same, if passengers break the quarantine rules, they may be required to pay the stipulated fine and/or one year imprisonment. All passengers are advised to avoid the long arm of the law and act in good conscience by adhering to the guidelines to protect the lives and livelihood of all Lagos residents.\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of the new guidelines and the ban on non-Nigerians travelling from three countries (India, Brazil and Turkey) into Nigeria, Lagos State has recorded 568 in-bound passengers, who have been permitted to enter Nigeria from these three countries. We have isolated 433 passengers in our various accredited hotels and facilities; 262 are in Isolation and 154 passengers have been discharged with a negative COVID-19 test.\n\n\u201cNine have tested positive to COVID-19 and successfully isolated to prevent community transmission. Of the remaining 135 passengers, 119 have refused isolation and 16 are unaccounted for.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOn May 24, 2021, the Presidential Steering Committee led by Mr. Boss Mustapha and working together with the COVID-19 response in Lagos State, led by the Incident Commander, the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, published a first list of defaulters of the laid down protocols travelling through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport as it relates to the red listed countries (India, Brazil and Turkey).\n\n\u201cAll passengers affected should contact the lead of our Case Management Unit, Dr. Abimbola Bowale, on [email protected] who will verify their status. The list of names who may have been mistakenly placed on this list and have been cleared will be sent to the Presidential Steering Committee for removal from the published names.\n\n\u201cHowever, all passengers that have been confirmed absconders will have their passports deactivated for a minimum of 1 year, if Nigerian and if foreign, will have their resident permits cancelled and deported as stated by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAll absconders will also face the penalties of the coronavirus pandemic Law 2021 of Lagos State, including varying lengths of prison time up to one year and fines of up to N500,000. All affected passengers are to present themselves to the Yaba Mainland Hospital for assessment and COVID-19 tests to evaluate their status.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner who warned against third wave of the COVID-19 wave, said regardless of the reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the state is yet to reach its target. \u201cGiven the requirement for achieving herd immunity (60 per cent of total population vaccinated), the state still needs to vaccinate about 14,000,000 (14 Million).\n\n\u201cHowever, the state would ensure ramp up testing by carrying out COVID-19 tests on all travelers.",

I just saw the picture and went to work. Needless to say, I\u2019m ecstatic as this is a major achievement for me early in my career. It sets the tone for what\u2019s to come and simultaneously opens up more doors for me across the broader entertainment industry.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the Nigerian music industry, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s more connectivity now. We\u2019re as connected as ever to the Nigerian music industry from the United States as ever thanks to social media. With that, the sound and influence is spanning across the globe both ways.\n\n\u201cMore American artists have been experimenting with Afrobeat driven music because it\u2019s become more prominent. There are also more international collaborations across the board as a result of all of this.\u201d\n\nHe also expressed a belief that he will succeed in the Nigerian music industry.\n\nHe said, \u201cOperating from North Hollywood but having my roots in Nigeria gives me unique leverage because I\u2019m foreign, yet familiar in the Nigerian market. Some aspects will build curiosity because of the distance and shift in culture.\n\n\u201cHowever, there\u2019s inherent relatability as a Nigerian American. Moreover, I\u2019ve personally made it a point to incorporate the Nigerian market in my career pursuits because I noticed that opportunity pretty early on. I\u2019m excited to be digging deeper in the Nigerian market and ultimately giving my native land something to be proud of with the international strides I\u2019ve made thus far in my career.\u201d",

          "text": "Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa, has raised $6.5m in a Series B round led by Partech from its Africa Fund.\n\nThe startup was founded in 2016 when Ihad Fikry and Ibrahim Kamel decided there was a need to cater to the learning needs in the MENA region that were not provided by other platforms.\n\n\u201cWe live in a region with a population of 400 million-plus people but 90% of them cannot learn properly in any other language but Arabic,\u201d Ihab Fikry, Almentor\u2019s co-founder and CEO, says to TechCabal.\n\nThe courses are designed to provide knowledge \u201cin a proper manner without promoting any ideology or religious thoughts,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHow Almentor works\n\nFrom gamified mobile apps to websites that enable streaming, online learning comes in different varieties across the world.\n\nHundreds of educational channels like TED-Ed, Khan Academy and Crash Course have carved a niche on YouTube, without having to build their own technologies. Where does Almentor fit in this universe?\n\nAlmentor can be accessed in multiple countries across Africa but the content is focused on North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nFikry describes Almentor as sharing the attributes of renowned platforms like Masterclass, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning.\n\nIt charges users a subscription to access its library of 12,000 videos.\n\nThe platform has a video-on-demand component that enables learners to stream content, while a learning management system engages users in classroom-like activities like asking and answering questions, and taking exams.\n\nAlmentor can be accessed anywhere, even in Nigeria, but the focus is to serve the Arabic region.\n\nTheir library includes math, history, natural sciences and training material for corporations. For social sciences where context may vary between countries, creators are selected from various countries to ensure the material is relevant. However, many users can find similarities because virtually every course is available in Arabic.\n\nAlmentor works with subject-matter teachers and professional content creators around the MENA region to create the courses. The company and the creators share revenue from subscriptions based on an agreement on exclusivity and whole ownership of the content by Almentor.\n\nFikry says they have received over 3,000 applications from people who want to create course material on Almentor, but the acceptance rate is currently at 12%. Besides welcoming applications, the startup proactively headhunts already successful lecturers and also engages agencies to recruit mentors for them.\n\nSo far, Almentor has provided 2 million successful learning experiences to users. Fikry explains this metric means the learner has consumed at least 25% of the learning material.\n\nLearning categories vary from basic (30% of their library) to intermediate and advanced levels.\n\nA typical Almentor learner is between ages 18 and 40 years old. 51% of learners are male while 49% are female. 60% are from Egypt, 25% are from Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain. The rest come from Algeria, Morocco, Niger and Arabs living in the US and UK.\n\nIn terms of socioeconomic status, Fikry says Almentor learners are between the middle and upper class.\n\n\u201cFor those in Class A+, they prefer to learn in English though some learn in French. For others, almost 40% can only learn in Arabic,\u201d Fikry, a PhD holder who used to be a management professor and PWC consultant, explains.\n\nSeed to Series B, driven by partnerships\n\nAs much as it is a service targeted as directly serving consumers, a key element of Almentor\u2019s progress has been over 80 partnerships it has entered with organisations and governments.\n\nOne such partnership is with the Ministry of Education in Egypt for a white-label curriculum targeted at 4.5 million students in grades 7 to 9. They have another with the government in the UAE to upskill entrepreneurs in the region.\n\nRegardless of the country or the partnership, Almentor\u2019s promise is that users will \u201clearn from a subject matter expert without being driven to any ideology,\u201d Fikry insists.\n\nIt is a sophisticated commitment that requires a range of management skills, beyond merely setting up technology for streaming and learning. It also needs capital to achieve its potential, Fikry says, which explains why they have sought out investors to continue to build.\n\nAs with having governments on board, working with VCs \u201cgives credibility to the platform as we are serving an area with lots of dynamics,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHe says they particularly sought out Partech for this round owing to the VC\u2019s global spread of portfolio companies spanning fintech, edtech and other sectors.\n\nWith this Series B, Almentor has now raised $14.5 million.\n\nIt opened the funding gates with a $3.5 million seed fund in 2016. In 2019, Almentor\u2019s $4.5 million Series A was led by Sawari Ventures, an Egyptian firm that closed a $71 million fund in April. Sawari also invested in this Series B round as Sango Capital, a firm based in South Africa.\n\nCyril Collon, general partner at Partech, described Fikry and his co-founder as \u201ctwo fantastic mission-driven entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nHe believes Almentor is the leading platform for self-learning in the Middle East and Africa, and is looking forward to helping the company expand access to \u201con-demand cutting-edge personal learning & developments options.\u201d",

          "text": "Barely seven months after a $30 million funding round in which Jeff Bezos participated, Chipper Cash has raised $100 million in a Series C round.\n\nThe round was led by SVB Capital, a US firm investing in an Africa-focused startup for the first time. Existing Chipper Cash investors like Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions and 500 Startups participated. One Way Ventures, Tribe Capital, and Brue2 Ventures also joined the round.\n\nChipper Cash enables individuals to transfer money at zero fees between African countries. It also offers Chipper Checkout, a paid service for businesses to receive payments by sharing payment links with customers or integrating a button on a website or app.\n\nBefore now, the startup was present in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. But Ham Serunjogi, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch they have now made their services available in the UK.\n\nThis expansion comes on the heels of a 33% increase in users \u2013 from 3 million in November 2020 to 4 million at present. Within this period, the company introduced new features to its app including virtual VISA cards for online shopping in Nigeria and crypto transactions in South Africa and Uganda.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also launching our US stocks product in Uganda, Nigeria and a few other countries soon,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nThis Series C marks a stunning rise for a three-year-old startup. It was founded in 2018 by Serunjogi, a Ugandan, and Maijid Moujaled, a Ghanaian. Three years later, the pair has steered the company to the top bracket of fintech startups on the continent, at least in terms of the amount of venture capital raised.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nSince May 2019 when they raised $2.4m, the startup\u2019s total funding stands at $152.2m. Serunjogi, the Chipper Cash CEO, declined to be specific about what the startup is now worth.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not getting into our valuation, but we\u2019re probably the most valuable private startup in Africa today after this round,\u201d he said.\n\nMaijid Moujaled (seated) and Ham Serunjogi, Chipper Cash co-founders\n\nIn March this year, Flutterwave \u2013 a private startup in Africa \u2013 raised $170m and explicitly said they were now valued at more than $1bn. Segunjogi\u2019s comment suggests that Chipper Cash may also now be worth over $1bn, even if they have raised $80m less than the Nigerian fintech.\n\nLike Flutterwave, Chipper Cash is headquartered in San Francisco but has over 200 employees working out of Africa and serving African customers. The startup plans to hire up to 100 staff for its expanding operations.",

Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT Hello, On Tuesday, Stripe announced a feature for merchants to create payment links and sell online without a website. As with many things from Stripe, it sounded unparalleled \u2013 another \u201cgame-changer\u201d in global e-payments. But allow Patrick Collison, Stripe\u2019s CEO, tell you where the proof of concept came from: \u201c\u2026the thing that\u2019s interesting to me about the payment link \u201cspace\u201d is that it\u2019s a use case that really took off in other markets first \u2014 Nigeria, India, Philippines, etc. I suspect that staying abreast of important new patterns emerging outside US/Europe will become more important for many businesses in the years ahead\u2026\u201d Payments links is one example of how emerging markets can teach developed economies a few tricks for the digital economy. Another space where Nigeria\u2019s example may influence the global space is real-time payments, as we\u2019ll see shortly after a message from our partners. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive in. Exporting e-payments One consequence of last year\u2019s pandemic was a sharp increase in the use of mobile wallets. According to a new report by ACI Worldwide, an American payments system company, mobile wallet adoption increased by 46% in 2020. Growth in 2019 was 40.6% while the mark for 2018 was 18.9%. This trend suggests that payments is becoming: more mobile: through apps available on smartphones, smart watches, etc and less in physical bank branches.\n\nfaster: if people are more confident to make payments online, it must be because both sender and receiver are getting notified of transaction success more quickly too. Indeed, online payments are becoming more real-time around the world. Real-time transaction volumes increased by 41% from 50 billion in 2019 to 70.3 billion in 2020. Transaction value rose by 32.8% from $69 trillion to $92 trillion. So which countries are driving this trend?\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights With 25.5 billion transactions in 2020, India is by far the global leader on real-time payments. China, South Korea, Thailand and the UK make up the top five.\n\nIndia\u2019s real-time payments revolution started in 2016 when the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was launched. They\u2019ve gone on to build an Immediate Payment System. But before all this, Nigeria made a similar historic move with NIBSS Instant Payments (NIP) in 2011.\n\nNIP is a real-time payment solution that guarantees instant value to beneficiaries. NIBSS (Nigeria Interbank Settlement Scheme, a company co-owned by banks in Nigeria) built E-bills Pay on the NIP platform to enable account-to-account payments.\n\nBoth creations have been described as part of the foundations for Nigeria\u2019s fintech boom today. Andrew Levin, the chief economics for PwC in Nigeria once called NIBSS the most impactful fintech in Nigeria. What NIBSS did in 2011, many are still in the process of creating. The US\u2019s first real-time payment network is barely four years old. Instant transfers through that network only became available on PayPal\u2019s Venmo in August 2019. The US Federal Reserve Bank plans to launch FedNow, a NIBSS NIP of sorts, in 2023.\n\nBut as good as NIBSS has been in Nigeria, some fintechs are already looking to go further in making transactions more real-time and unifying payments.\n\nTeamApt, a startup founded in 2015, introduced a \u201cvirtual account\u201d system that has become a standard for instant transfers among Nigerian fintechs. This year, a new startup has come out of beta to provide instant settlement for businesses. It is already being called \u201cNIBSS for fintechs.\u201d\n\nThe upshot: Nigeria does not have India or China\u2019s population to top real-time payments lists. Nigerian consumers may not be at the income levels in economies like South Korea and the UK. But as Collison said, the West African country is a place to watch for trends that could shape the future of online payments. FROM THE CABAL Nigeria-based fintech OPay is said to be plotting a $400 million fundraise that will see it valued at $1.5 billion. The money will be deployed to deepend its impressive payments processing operation in Nigeria and expansion elsewhere. There\u2019s that will see it valued at $1.5 billion.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "In 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a directive to banks mandating them to increase the number of loans they give. Consequently, there was an increase in loan requests.\n\nWith technology and the rise of money-lending platforms like Carbon, Branch, FairMoney, and Migo, offering personal collateral-free loans, anyone can borrow money without visiting a bank.\n\nThis means that lenders are more accessible. However, since the onset of the pandemic, they have had a tough time as borrowers haven\u2019t repaid their loans, citing the economic effects of COVID-19.\n\nIn 2020, the CBN activated the Global Standing Instruction (GSI) policy allowing banks to withdraw defaulting loans from any account held by a borrower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile loan collection for BVN-linked bank accounts may be somewhat smooth, the reverse is the case for credit fintech startups.\n\nMoreover, with millions of people demanding personal loans, lending amounts for these platforms become smaller. Also, lenders experience difficulties in collection for small amounts.\n\nThis challenge prompted the three co-founders \u2014 Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Julian Flosbach; Chief Production Officer (CPO), Moses Nmor; and Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chukwudi Enyi \u2014 to come up with BFREE, in August 2020.\n\nThrough its tech-enabled and credit management solution that makes collection processes more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly, BFREE concentrates on helping its customers with their finances.\n\n\u201cLending has experienced a digital revolution, but credit collection needs to be efficient, scalable, and ethical. That\u2019s exactly what we are doing at BFREE,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\nThe team met at FairMoney, where Flosbach was General Manager. Enyi was the Head of Growth at Nairabox, OPay, and FairMoney, while Nmor is a former team member at OPay, Kudi, and FairMoney.\n\nTheir duties at FairMoney were mostly related to managing loan collection. They\u2019d also all spent time at different fast-scaling financial startups where loan collection was a problem.\n\n\u201cAll the co-founders used to work in large digital lending fintech startups in Nigeria, and collections were always a struggle. Hence, we looked at the collection process to come up with a way to reinvent it from scratch to fix these challenges,\u201d Enyi reveals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile lending has evolved digitally, loan collection is still done traditionally through law firms and smaller collection agencies, with little or no transparency or accountability.\n\nBesides, customers are often threatened with calls, messages, and emails, which Flosbach calls \u201ca no-go for impact-oriented lenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough lenders are specialists and may seem to be focused on lending, they may not be skilled or focused on collections,\u201d Flosbach clarifies.\n\nTherefore, there is a need to specialise in loan collection and lending because the two products are different.\n\n\u201cThe lenders\u2019 tech improves the actual lending product and not collection. All the digital lenders I know look to outsource their collections due to the scalability issue,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nSolving an actual problem\n\nLending platforms unavoidably end up with Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide outsourcing services for large telcos or banks by managing their teleservices and customer services.\n\nSince the BPO companies are not lending professionals, the co-founders aim to help lenders get their money from their customers.\n\nCustomers fail to repay their loans for different reasons. Therefore, a different approach is required to make them pay back.\n\n\u201cNo legit customer takes a loan with the intention to default. However, life does not always go according to plan. In the end, a customer that cannot service a loan is in a financial emergency,\u201d Enyi explains.\n\nTo tackle this, they first identify why the customer defaulted before deploying machine language algorithms. BFREE uses a combination of a self-servicing platform, chat and call bots, and human contact centre operations after identifying how customers can repay.\n\n\u201cHere we deploy machine learning algorithms that predict the probability to repay a customer and define the use case of the customer,\u201d Flosbach submits.\n\nAnd if customers have not been repaying their loans and interests to the lenders, it\u2019s likely BFREE reaches out to them.\n\n\u201cIf a customer has not been servicing a balance from a lender, there is a good chance that we will get in contact with them and offer our product to find a solution that works for the customers and the lender,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nOn the other hand, customers who don\u2019t repay are addressed differently.\n\n\u201cCustomers who don\u2019t repay don\u2019t want to because they don\u2019t see the benefits of repaying. Hence, they need financial literacy,\u201d Flosbach adds.\n\nBefore such customers start servicing a loan again, the startup gives them some financial education like understanding the importance of loan repayment and credit score.\n\n\u201cWe try as much to incentivise these customers to cooperate with us. For example, we offer them a discount on their loan repayments. After offering them the incentives, we do our financial literacy classes,\u201d says Flosbach.\n\nMeanwhile, they are currently testing these classes through their self-service platform to see how effective they would be on debt customers.\n\n\u201cWe do not use an app for our self-servicing platform, but a webview, which works like a webpage,\u201d he discloses.\n\nWhile they reach out to the debtors, the co-founders believe that in an ethical credit collection, not everyone would repay.\n\nAt the moment, Flosbach claims there is no other fintech startup offering the same service as BFREE on the continent.\n\n\u201cThere is no similar innovation in Africa in our space of the lending value chain. This part has been overlooked for quite a while, and our competition mainly consists of BPO companies.\u201d\n\nHowever, the team believes that with time, competition for innovation in credit collections in Africa would increase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d welcome this step as it is always better for the end-customers if options are competing for the best customer value,\u201d Flosbach declares.\n\nA sustainable model\n\nOn how BFREE makes money, Flosbach explains, \u201cWe charge a certain percentage commission of the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size, portfolio quality, and likes.\u201d\n\nAnd how sustainable is that?\n\n\u201cIt is sustainable. We have very solid unit economics as our solutions work very well, and we usually achieve at least 30% higher repayments than the BPO companies,\u201d he continues.\n\nThough the credit fintech startup operates a B2B2C model, with currently over 300,000 customers, it has its challenges.\n\n\u201cOne of our challenges is to convince lenders that there is a better way to do collection than how they\u2019ve been doing it,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom Nigeria to Africa\n\nThe Lagos-based credit startup recently raised an $800,000 pre-seed round to build a solution for all emerging markets struggling with infrastructure for collection in Africa. Nigeria-based Beta.Ventures, Launch Africa Ventures, and GreenHouse Capital led the round.\n\n\u201cWe focus all of our product development to assist customers in a state of financial emergency. There are millions of customers in personal debt. This is really what motivates us as a team,\u201d Nmor declares.\n\nThe team is bullish about the Kenyan market they are expanding into.\n\n\u201cWe have a team on the ground already that is setting up our solution as we speak,\u201d Flosbach reveals.\n\nIn the Kenyan market, there have been several cases where BPO companies threatened or publicly shamed customers, something Flosbach considers inappropriate for lenders.\n\nWhile debt consumers may default on a payment due to unforeseen circumstances, the high interest on payment is also a factor.\n\nRecall that in digital predatory lending in Nigeria, we highlighted how the interest rate upon repayment is one reason debt consumers don\u2019t repay promptly.\n\nIn Kenya, where scores of apps offering short-term advances similar to payday loans are common, the interest rate upon repayment is also a problem.\n\nThe credit fintech startup offers a personal budgeting service to debt consumers to help them spend within their means and repay their loans with interest promptly.\n\nThrough its consumer personal budgeting processes, algorithms, and financial literacy, BFREE believes it will tackle Africa\u2019s rising consumer debt.\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Google-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, released an update to its terms of service in November 2020. While it immediately took effect for users in the US, users outside the US will begin to experience the change from June 1, 2021.\n\nThe update revealed that taxes will now be levied on the royalties of content creators resident in the US, who are already entitled to payments on the platform. This will soon take place in other countries as the new terms of service are rolled out.\n\nThe platform revisited its data privacy policy and warned strongly that it would not permit the collection of any information, facial recognition data inclusive, that might be used to identify a user without their permission.\n\nYouTube also emphasised its right to monetise all content on the platform as it announced that ads might appear on channels not in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), and the YouTubers who own these channels will not get a revenue cut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this means is that as a content creator on YouTube who isn\u2019t a partner on YPP, ads \u2014 which YouTube says you\u2019re not entitled to get payments for \u2014 might now appear during your videos.\n\nThe YPP was launched in December 2007 as a means of revenue generation for creators, who allow ads to appear on their videos for an amount of money. Members of the YPP have to meet certain criteria, including having up to 1,000 active subscribers and 4,000 valid watch hours in the last 12 months.\n\nAnd what\u2019re the implications of this?\n\nThe new policy puts some creators on the platform at a disadvantage, especially those still looking to grow their channels.\n\nRejoice Ambrose, a growing YouTuber running a lifestyle channel, thinks this may be detrimental to her growth.\n\n\u201cI do not think it\u2019s fair. I mean, ads can be so annoying; talk less for those of us who are still trying to grow our channel. How are we going to maintain viewers when they have to endure ads appearing on our videos, and we won\u2019t even get paid for them? But then, it\u2019s their platform; I don\u2019t think we can really do anything about it,\u201d she tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nIn YouTube\u2019s defence, more ads are a part of the company\u2019s investment in solutions that help advertisers reach a larger audience and scale their businesses.\n\nWe previously explored why some Nigerian YouTubers have to look outside the platform to get revenue for reasons like low content engagements because most of their viewers face the issue of low broadband access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith these new updates, one can only wonder what the fate of budding and professional Africa-based YouTubers will be, as a large chunk of their audience is in demographics with low access to stable Internet data.\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "The move by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) last Tuesday that saw the regulator adopt the NAFEX rate of N410.25 per US dollar on its website received accolades from many industry players as they tagged it a \u2018major step\u2019 towards full exchange rate unification.\n\nBut, analysts say though commendable, it is nothing more than recognising what was due for recognition as more than 90 percent of economic transactions were already using the rate long before it was updated on Tuesday.\n\nThe government had since March adopted the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window rate (also known as the NAFEX rate) for government transactions, the CBN retained the old N379 per dollar official rate on its website, which created some confusion for investors.\n\nThe CBN pulled down the rate two weeks ago and followed that action up by officially adopting the I&E window rate on its website where the naira is quoted at a weaker rate of N410.25 per dollar.\n\nIssues around liquidity and restriction on dollar deposits and usage are bigger challenges to full unification than merely recognising an overdue update on the CBN website, analysts say.\n\n\u201cI would not expect any significant impact on the economy,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, investment research analyst at United Capital, states.\n\nRead Also: BDCs tell public to patronize CBN-licenced operators\n\nNigeria, unlike it African peers, has continued to operate multiple exchange rate windows. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Presidential Economic Advisory Council hold the view that ditching the multiple exchange rates practice, which Nigeria started in 2016 in reaction to lower oil prices, will open up the economy to badly-needed investments.\n\nA Lagos-based economist believes the efforts at regulation of use only create artificial scarcity and ultimately keeps driving the rate down against the dollar.\n\n\u201cInstead of a gradual merge, liberalise the market \u2013 allow cash dollars paid into domiciliary accounts for payments and transfers. In no more than six months all the noise and speculation will disappear,\u201d an analyst, who pleaded anonymity, says.\n\nAccording to him, if the market is liberalised the naira will settle at its true value, which is higher than the current NAFEX rate.\n\nThe gap between the CBN official exchange rate and the parallel market, the rate at which most Nigerians access the dollar, deepened last Wednesday following the speculation from the recent move by the apex bank.\n\nNaira fell in the parallel market to its lowest level in five months at N493 per dollar on Wednesday, the weakest since November 30, 2020, when the currency depreciated to N510/$.\n\nData collated from the black market implies a gap of N83 between the now official NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate.\n\n\u201cThere is so much cash dollars in the economy but people cannot use it except for no more than $5,000. Even that with so many restrictions,\u201d another analyst who asked not to be quoted, says.\n\nAs part of its efforts to curtail demand for forex and reduce the utilisation of the banking system to facilitate black market dealing in forex, the apex bank, in a guideline issued last year reduced the amount of cash dollar deposit in domiciliary accounts by 50 percent from $10,000 to $5,000 monthly.\n\nBut despite its effort to curtail the demand for the dollar, the policy by the apex bank has failed to yield results as the value of the naira has continued to depreciate. The CBN devalued the currency on two occasions last year.\n\nThe naira at the CBN\u2019s FX window has depreciated by an average of 7.7 percent annually in the last 10 years, according to Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nThe continuous devaluation of the naira is a key concern for both local and foreign investors who are looking to preserve the purchasing power of their savings and investments. Foreign investors have had their money trapped in Nigeria\u2019s debt market since March 2020 amid dollar shortage.\n\nDollar supply challenges in Nigeria come from its dependency on the foreign earnings from crude oil, which has continued to account for over 90 percent of the export of Africa\u2019s largest economy. Although on the rise, the falling global crude price always reduces FX supply in Nigeria and affects the exchange rate like in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\u201cTo have stable currency Nigeria must diversify the sources of its FX supply,\u201d Ebo states.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Government has expressed concern over 16,100 Nigerians killed annually by tobacco, calling for urgent measures and partnerships among relevant stakeholders to check its consumption and reduce the health and other risks associated with tobacco use.\n\nPermanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Health, Dr. Osamwonyi Irowa said this while briefing journalists in Benin City in commemoration of the World No Tobacco Day, marked by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other organs to raise awareness and check the consumption of tobacco.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe WHO reports that tobacco kills over 8 million people each year and more than 7 million of these deaths are as a result of direct tobacco use, while around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.\n\n\u201cThe Tobacco Atlas 2018 report for Nigeria, estimates more than 16,100 annual deaths from tobacco-related diseases. Also, a research published in 2021 by the Centre for the Study of the Economics of Africa showed that 29,472 deaths were attributable to smoking. It is also pertinent to note that tobacco is the major risk factor for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and is associated with higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and death.\u201d\n\nIrowa said the theme for this year\u2019s celebration, \u2018Commit to Quit\u2019 is apt as WHO has set a target of supporting at least 100 million people worldwide in their attempt to quit the use of tobacco by adopting various initiatives such as digital solutions.\n\nIrowa said the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has keyed into the concept of supporting people in the State in quitting tobacco as WHO\u2019s findings have shown that many tobacco users are willing to quit the habit and therefore need support.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe State Government is ever committed to support the Federal Ministry of Health with the WHO on the roll out of Nigeria Tobacco Control Communication Plan, the toll-free line for tobacco cessation in Nigeria and the WhatsApp cessation service, which will be launched by the Honourable Minister of Health today in Abuja.\n\n\u201cToday as we observe World No Tobacco Day, I call on people of all ages, especially the young, to join the fight against the tobacco epidemic. I encourage youth groups to build a movement for a tobacco free generation.\n\n\u201cI urge our celebrities and influencers to join their voices on tobacco cessation; I call on parents, caregivers and teachers to educate children on the harmful effects of tobacco products and the need to stop for those already using it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that the Government of Edo State will continue to implement comprehensive tobacco policies as outlined in the National and WHO framework convention on Tobacco control to help reduce the morbidity and mortality from tobacco use,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has given a notice to the Federation Account and Allocation Committee (FAAC) that it will deduct about N126 billion from its remittance to the Federation Account at the next meeting scheduled for June, amid rising subsidy payments.\n\nIn a report signed by NNPC\u2019s Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer, the corporation stated that subsequently, it will begin the subtraction of the balance of an additional N50 billion, being Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery to sustain crude oil production level.\n\nIn the document which detailed the status of the corporation\u2019s finances during its monthly FAAC meeting, which took place between May 19 and 20, the NNPC also confirmed that it did not make any remittance to the Federation Account during the period.\n\nThe development may further throw the three tiers of government, federal, states and local governments, into harsher times next month as they may get less from the Federation Account, as a result of the huge payment the NNPC is paying for subsidy on petrol, ThisDay reported.\n\nIn April, the corporation had notified the Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Ahmed Idris, that it would not be able to remit any funds to the Federation Account in April for distribution in May.\n\nNNPC said it posted a value shortfall of N111.966 billion in February 2021, which would ultimately impact on its ability to contribute to the joint account shared among the federal, state and local governments.\n\nThe corporation attributed the N111.966 billion shortfall to the rising average landing cost of petrol, which jumped to N184 per litre in March as opposed to the existing N128 ex-coastal price.\n\nAccording to the corporation, the N111.966 billion incurred as landing cost would be deducted from April oil and gas proceeds due to the federation in May.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the impact on the federation was not as far-reaching as expected because the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), which collects royalties and bonuses on behalf of the federal government, came to the rescue with the remittance of about $500 million it received from the marginal fields it recently put up for bids.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, had confirmed the role played by DPR in augmenting the FAAC allocation for April, which was shared in May.\n\nThe minister, however, did not disclose how much was paid into the account.\n\nBut the NNPC had in a reaction to the dust raised by the letter to the accountant general, stated that the corporation wasn\u2019t broke, adding that the zero revenue projection only had to do with the federation revenue stream, which it manages and not a general reflection of its overall financial performance.\n\nIn the fresh notice raised by the corporation to deduct N126 billion from its remittance in June, it said it was still shouldering the burden of the differentials from the sale of petrol, which it prefers to call \u201cunder-recovery\u201d.\n\nThe FAAC document added: \u201cNo remittance to Federation Account in April, 2021 (May, 2021 FAAC) due to recorded value shortfall resulting from difference between landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in March, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe sum of N61,966,456,903.74 was deducted out of the total March value shortfall of N111,966,456,903.74. This is to make funds available for JV cost recovery to sustain the existing production level. The balance $50,000,000,000.00 will be deducted in subsequent months.\n\n\u201cIn addition, April value shortfall of N126,298,457,944.36 is to be deducted from May federation proceeds in June 2021 FAAC meeting.\u201d\n\nThe figures further showed that while a net revenue of N90.8 billion was remitted to FAAC in January, N64.1 billion was remitted in February, N41.1 billion was presented in March and zero amount recorded for April.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporation has said that it sold total oil and gas valued at $565.4 million or an equivalent of N214.5 billion in April, according to the document.\n\nNNPC stated that its overall crude oil lifting for both export and domestic in March 2021, recorded 29 per cent decrease relative to the 10.79Mbbls lifted in February 2021.\n\nThe national oil company said Nigeria maintained 1.52 million bpd OPEC production cut in the first quarter of 2021, while export crude oil revenue received in April amounted to $1.89 million, equivalent to N723 million.\n\n\u201cThis represents a 98 per cent decrease compared to March 2021. Domestic gas receipts in the month was N5.13bn,\u201d it added.\n\nIt stated that feedstock valued at $54.6 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period out of which $52.4 million was received during the month, with the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\nMCA is a financing agreement whereby the International Oil Companies (IOCs) advance loans to NNPC to invest in upstream projects.\n\nFor other receipts, the corporation stated that $1.25 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in April 2021.\n\nThe data also showed that the exchange rate the CBN sold foreign exchange to the NNPC moved from N379 to N383.47, while N15 billion was spent on government priority projects.\n\nIn the same month, the corporation lost 3.1 million barrels for various reasons, ranging from shut-ins due to repairs, industrial actions, flow line leaks and power failure.\n\nOn the analysis of receipts due in April, gross revenue from JV crude was N124.3 billion, JV gas was N26.1 billion, while N5.8 billion was received from miscellaneous sources, amounting to N156.3 billion.\n\nAfter deduction of royalty, JV cost recovery, profit before tax and taxes, receipts from JV crude came down to N5.5 billion, while that of JV gas stood at N7.8 billion.\n\nOf the March domestic crude oil payable in June by the NNPC, in line with the 90-day payment plan, Chevron Nigeria Limited has roughly 2.89 million barrels valued at N72.6 billion while Eroton\u2019s share is 130,000 barrels valued at N3.1 billion.\n\nAlso, Mobil Producing has 2.84 million litres, valued at N68 billion, Seplat\u2019s is N3.36 billion, SPDC\u2019s share of the JV is N33.6 billion while the value of Total\u2019s crude oil payable in June is N3.1 billion, totalling approximately N184.5 billion or equivalent of $487 million.\n\nAs of March 31, total pre-2016 JV cash call arrears repayment status indicated that JV negotiated debt remained at $4.68 billion, total payment till date is $3.1 billion, while outstanding balance is $1.54 billion, with the exception of Mobil which has been fully paid by the NNPC.\n\nIn April, N938.9 million was spent on security and maintenance, while strategic holdings of the NNPC gulped N740 million, amounting to N1.679 billion.\n\nIn all, 37 vessels imported petrol for the month under review, with landing cost ranging from between N169 and N199.90. Also, a total of N1.48 billion litres were imported for the month, 1.99 billion litres were sold, with depot price remaining at N128 and the recorded loss put at N111.9 billion.\n\nNNPC: Negotiations Ongoing to Acquire Stake in Dangote Refinery,\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari, yesterday clarified that the plan by the corporation to purchase 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote has not been concluded.\n\nKyari, in a text message in response to enquiries by THISDAY on the matter, said the terms of the agreement were being finalised and could be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\nHe added that the NNPC is interested in acquiring a stake in any private refinery with a capacity in excess of 50,000 barrels per day and not just the Dangote Refinery alone.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Dangote Refinery acquisition, it\u2019s actually an ongoing negotiations that was disclosed by one of our executives. We haven\u2019t concluded; terms are being finalised and may be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to discuss the details at this point. However, the decision is for NNPC to expand her portfolio as is the common practice amongst national oil companies as matter of energy security considerations and risk management. We will take equity from any refinery that plans to process in excess of 50,000 barrels per day, not just the Dangote.\u201d\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated Dangote Refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene, is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce about 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and four million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nParts of this report is credit to ThisDay",

Economic and social activities have been halted and there is a heavy security presence in major locations of the state to maintain law and order.\n\nThe situation is not too different in Ebonyi State as few vehicles were seen on the highway. The inner streets were deserted with security men positioned at different locations.\n\nThe state governor David Umahi had earlier instructed that no resident will be penalised if he or she chooses to stay at home.\n\nMany businesses in Delta State capital, Asaba were also shut as residents comply with the sit-at-home order.

          "text": "The Senate has summoned the Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume, over the alleged failure of lottery operators to remit appropriate revenues to the coffers of the Federal Government.\n\nThe chairman, Senate Committee on Sports, Senator Obinna Ogba, disclosed on Monday after his committee\u2019s meeting with the lottery operators and the regulatory agency.\n\nLEADERSHIP recall that the Senate had in April resolved and mandated the panel to conduct an investigation into the alleged loss of hundreds of billions of naira as revenue annually.\n\nThe resolution was sequel to a debate on a motion moved at plenary by Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, calling on the Senate to probe the non-execution of terms of settlement between the Nigerian Lottery Regulatory Commission(NLRC) and one of the lottery firms, Ghana Games in Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a mild drama at the committee\u2019s sitting on Monday when the representatives of Western Lotto and those of Premier Lotto clashed at the investigative hearing.\n\nWestern Lotto, which said it has the franchise to run the Ghana Games in Nigeria, was owned by the late Senator Buruji Kashamu while the Premier Lotto, which is challenging former\u2019s claim is owned by Chief Adebutu Kessington, aka Baba Ijebu.\n\nTrouble started when the Managing Director of Western Lotto Company, Mr. Olumide Adedeji, told the Senate panel and the regulatory agency that his firm had relevant documents from the Ghana Lottery Commission as its main representative in Nigeria.\n\nAdedeji accused the NLRC of failing to implement the terms of agreement to set up the Ghana Games Lottery Commission in Nigeria in order for Western Lotto be earning its due commission.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the Managing Director of Premier Lotto, Mr. Ajibola Adebutu, asked the Senate to disregard the claim by Adedeji, saying granting such request would make the Western Lotto an operator and regulator at the same time.\n\nAttempts by Adedeji to explain that the NLRC would be the main regulator of the proposed Ghana Games Commission was resisted by Adebutu and the situation led to a stalemate, which forced the panel to meet behind-closed-doors thereafter.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the closed-door meeting, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Sport, Senator Ogba, said the meeting was unable to settle contentious issues.\n\nHe said the the committee have decided to summon the Special Duties Minister and the NLRC board members to resolve the contentious issue by next Monday.\n\nOgba added that the Minister would also to tell the Senate why the South-East and the South-South geopolitical zones were not being represented on the board of the NLRC.\n\n\u201cThe issue was not finally resolved. Our interest is to ensure that the Federal Government generate revenue in to its purse.\n\n\u201cAll over the world, lottery is an an avenue to generate revenue. What we discovered is that the country is not getting much revenue from the lottery operators.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operators are also saying that they have been paying a lot of money to government. In fact one of the operators, Bet Naija claimed that he paid N18bn to the Federal Government coffers in the last three months. We want to find out where these monies have gone to. We want to find out.\n\n\u201cAbout the Ghana Games, some operators are scared that that the operator should not play the role of a regulator.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved that all monies generated should go to the Federal Government directly. It is now the Federal Government that will determine who has the franchise and pay him the percentage due to him.\n\n\u201cThe committee has adjourned till Monday and we have invited the board of the lottery commission. We are also inviting the Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume.\n\n\u201cWe will also raise the issue of the non-representation of the South-East and South-South on the board of the lottery agency.\n\n\u201cIt is Mr President that constitutes the board so? We will ask the minister to communicate to the executive that it had contravened the Act that established the commission for not including the South-East and South-South geopolitical zones on the board,\u201d Ogba said.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that Nwaoboshi had in his motion last month at Senate plenary, said that Nigeria, despite its 200 million population, was reportedly generating about N2bn billion annually from lottery proceeds, while Burkina Faso with a population of 20 million was generating about N562bn annually.\n\nHe also said Ivory Coast with a population of 25 million was generating about N312bn annually, among other sub-Saharan countries earning much high revenue than Nigeria from lottery proceeds.\n\nHe further noted that lottery in Nigeria had the potential to increase the county\u2019s revenue base from the $1557.7bn global lottery market based on a study which indicated that Nigerians spent over N2bn on sports betting daily and about $2.2bn per annum.\n\nThe senator had expressed concern that statutory remittances by most lottery operators in the country remained extremely poor and not reflective of the actual sales generated by operators.\n\nHe had said that it was because a proposed terms settlement, approved by the Governing Board of NLRC, has not been executed.\n\nThe Senate President, therefore, mandated the Senate Committee on Sports to investigate the alleged non-execution of the settlement and report back within four weeks.",

Joshua said; \u201cShe went to church one day and when she returned she started waking up at 3am to go and pray.\n\nI asked her why she was braving the chilly weather just to pray, but instead, she decided to move out to a neighboring homestead.\u201d It was gathered that Joshua tried to plead with her not to go but she refused. She told him she will come back once her \u201cspirit husband\u201d has granted her permission.\n\nHer neighbour, Pastor Albert Rumaita granted her wish by officiating the peculiar wedding. He is also said to be the one who bought her the wedding gown and even ensured there was a convoy of cars to escort her on her big day.\n\nRumaita said; \u201cI made the decision to preside over, plan and fund the wedding because the world might just be coming to an end and because I\u2019m her neighbour.\u201d After the wedding, an elated Elizabeth said she was done with serving the world and has now changed her life to serving God.

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nImo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma has broken his silence on the murder of a former presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak and the purported attack on his convoy.\n\nUzodinma, who spoke at a news conference on Monday in Imo, condemned the brutal assassination of Gulak, saying his death was a personal loss to him because he was an invaluable friend and brother whose sense of justice, fairness and uprightness endeared Gulak to him.\n\n\u201cI was shocked to my marrows when the sad news of his callous murder was broken to me. I was getting ready to go to church when the sad news came and I could not attend the service again. It was simply one of the most devastating news I have had in my life and I am yet to recover from the shock. It remains a puzzle to me why anyone would want to murder him in this gruesome and vicious manner.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Ahmed Gulak was in Imo State for a national assignment. He came to Owerri with the Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendment. Being a humble man, he chose to travel incognito according to his friend who was with him. Someone must have trailed him from the hotel to the airport. That is exactly why his gruesome murder appears to be a clear case of political assassination.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports by the police, he was shot in cold blood and the assailants did not remove a pin from him. It is most benumbing that people chose to waste such an innocent blood in such a dastardly and cowardly manner.\n\n\u201cLet me make it very clear that everything will be done by security agencies to find those who murdered Gulak and their sponsors. They will not by the grace of God escape their deserved punishment. This is not in our character as Ibos, not in our tradition nor in our culture. We must condemn this callous act,\u201d he stated.\n\nUzodinma urged everybody to exercise restraint and allow the police to continue with their investigations, which he understood was already yielding positive results as some arrests had already been made.\n\nHe said it was reassuring that President Muhammadu Buhari, had assured the nation that the perpetrators of this heinous crime would be apprehended and punished.\n\n\u201cOn our part as a government, we are not sparing any effort in ensuring that the murderers of this patriot are quickly arrested and prosecuted for their evil deeds.\n\n\u201cImo people are very hospitable. The events of the last few weeks do not represent who we truly are.I believe that the ongoing police investigations will uncover the whole truth; it is common knowledge that those who are innocent need not be afraid.\n\n\u201cBut the guilty will never go scot-free, certainly not in this instant case. Let me also through this medium commiserate with relations and families of victims of kidnapping, armed robberies, banditry and stray bullets in Imo state and to inform you that the government has been reaching out and will continue to reach out to all other victims,\u201d he added.\n\nHe assured that the state government was committed to finding and punishing the killers.\n\nUzodinma also rubbished claims that his convoy was attacked, saying nothing like that even happened.\n\n\u201cFinally, let me also clarify the story trending on the social media platforms, that my convoy was attacked, my convoy was never attacked. That is the wish of those who murdered Gulak,\u201d he said.",

Despite the rantings by governors of the region, the people chose to obey Kanu and stayed way.\n\nThe streets were deserted, not even the Federal Government\u2019s order is ever obeyed like this one. No vehicular movement, no trading, the southeast states were like ghost town on Monday.\n\nEconomic activities were paralysed in many areas, despite government\u2019s assurance that people should come out and that they would be protected, residents chose to stay away. Schools, banks, companies and others were closed. Residents understand the mayhem that has greeted southeast in the last few months, with series bombing, attack on helpless policemen, police stations, INEC offices, among others on daily basis. No one needs to be told to stay away to salvage their lives, especially when confidence in governments of the day has completely waned.\n\nIn Umuahia, the Abia capital, and adjoining villages, residents stayed back home, leaving the streets, especially the ever-busy city centre, known as Isigate, completely deserted.\n\nGovernment offices, schools, banks, shops, business centres, markets, malls and plazas and petrol outlets remained closed.\n\nAlso, private and commercial vehicles kept off the roads, leaving the metropolis like a ghost town.\n\nIn Imo, socio-economic activities were also at a standstill amidst heavy security presence in major cities and towns, including Owerri, the state capital.\n\nMarkets, roadside shops, malls and filling stations were not open, while suburbs near Owerri blocked all their entrances to ward off invasion by stranger elements.\n\nAreas with heavy security presence include Akachi, Okigwe and Dick Tiger Roads, Imo State University Junction, Control Junction, Airport Junction, Obiangwu-Ngor Okpala and Amakohia- Akwakuma Flyover and the World Bank/Umuguma Junction.\n\nIn Awka, Anambra State, residents also complied with the directive as hotels, restaurants and markets in the city and surrounding villages remained closed. Also, schools, government offices and banks did not open, in spite of the deployment of heavy security in the area.\n\nIn Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, social and economic activities were brought to a standstill as businesses and shops remained closed. movement was paralysed in the area as people stayed at home.\n\nthe Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu Alike Ikwo (AEFUNAI) in Ebonyi cancelled all academic activities slated for Monday in a bid to protect the lives of students. Also, banks, companies and others were shut.\n\nIn Enugu, Socio-economic activities were shut down. According to the News Agency of Nigeria all the streets, markets, banks, schools and government offices were closed. Also closed for businesses were filling stations, malls and even hospitals.\n\nMajor markets \u2013 Mayor, Garki, Ogbete, New Market \u2013 were all shut down; while banks, other financial institutions, shops, malls and newspaper distribution axis did not open for business.\n\nThe compliance to the sit-at-home order was near 100 percent.

          "text": "A two-day zonal public hearing of the Senate on the review of the 1999 Constitution on Thursday ended with stakeholders from the North-East demanding the creation of additional states, 25 per cent derivation, gender equality, free and compulsory education, among others.\n\nThe exercise was organised by the Senate in 12 centres across the country to collate the views of Nigerians on the key areas to be amended in the 1999 Constitution in order to address agitations in the country.\n\nIn Bauchi centre, the people of Southern Borno comprising nine local government areas on Thursday disagreed with the position of the Borno State government and insisted on the creation of Savannah State.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after presenting their memorandum, a representative of the movement for the creation of Savannah State and former Secretary to Borno State government, Ambassador Dauda Danladi said the southern part of the state is being marginalised, hence the need for the new state.\n\nThe speaker of Borno State House Assembly, Abdulkarim Lawan had on Wednesday kicked against the creation of an additional state from Borno, which was demanded by the stakeholders in September last year in a letter to the Senate.\n\nIn the document, the group said the move was necessary as Borno is the largest in the country in terms of landmass to enhance self-determination, compatibility, equitable and even development, and responsive governance.\n\nWith the proposed capital in Damboa, they further said it will comprise nine LGAs in Southern Borno Senatorial District \u2013 Askira/Uba, Bayo, Biu, Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Hawul, Kwaya-Kusar and Shani.\n\n\u201cWe the people of Askira/Uba, Bayo, Biu, Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Hawul, Kwaya-Kusar and Shani Local Government Areas of Borno State wish to present our request for the creation of Savannah State out of the present Borno State.\n\n\u201cWe had before now presented requests for the creation of this proposed State at various times in recent years. Between 1982, 1983 and 1996 a request was made by the people of these Local Government Areas of the former Borno State for the Creation of Savannah State to the National Assembly of the Second Republic\n\n\u201cDuring the agitation across the country in 1991 for the creation of more States, requests were made for the creation of two States out of the former Borno State, namely; Savannah and Yobe States. The request for the creation of Yobe State was granted.\n\n\u201cWe had also earlier submitted this request to the National Constitutional Conference through its Committee on the States Creation. The move to kick start the process of reviewing the 1999 constitution then, which could accommodate states and local governments creation along with necessary boundary adjustments was indeed a welcome development and we enthusiastically participated.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, we equally submitted our request to the National Conference Committee on states creation. That effort resulted in the shortlisting of SAVANNAH State as one of the fourteen (14) states recommended for creation in Nigeria. The 2014 Conference report has again clearly shown that SAVANNAH state met all necessary criteria for the creation of the state in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo us, this present move by your humble and esteem selves to Kick-start the process of review of the 1999 Constitution which could accommodate States and Local Government Creation and necessary boundary adjustments, is indeed a welcome stride and we pray that our submission will again receive the blessing of the National Assembly. It is in this regard that we wish to respectfully submit our memorandum for the creation of SAVANNAH STATE with its proposed capital at DAMBOA.\n\n\u201cUnder and in fulfilment of the provisions of section 8(1)(a) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, all the democratically elected members at the National, State and local government levels representing the area demanding for the creation of Savannah State, have after consideration of the long time yearnings and aspirations of the people of the proposed state, endorsed this noble request for the creation of SAVANNAH STATE.\n\n\u201cGiven the opportunities provided by the State creation to bring Government closer to the people and to foster even and rapid development, the people of the proposed Savannah State who are eager to bring about balanced and accelerated development are making this passionate appeal for your kind consideration of our request for the creation of Savannah State,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe letter further said \u201cin making our demand for curving out Savannah State out of the present Borno State, we have been motivated by our desire to bring Government closer to our people and to accelerate rapid and even development of the sub-region as well as the need to remain united within the context of the New State and the Nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the creation of Savannah State out of the present BornoState will make it possible for both states to plan and provide the basis for integrated and even development and thus create more investment and employment opportunities for our people.\n\n\u201cThe proposed Savannah State is richly endowed with Solid Minerals, agricultural products, tourism potentials and human resources that can be harnessed to lay a solid foundation for the transformation of the State.\n\n\u201cIt is an incontrovertible fact that greater part of both the human and material resources of the present Borno state come from the southern part. We are confident that the resources available to the proposed savannah state can sustain it, and make it even more viable than many already established state.\u201d\n\nAmong the mineral resources listed are quartz, limestone, iron ore and magnesium.",

          "text": "World number two Naomi Osaka says she is withdrawing from the French Open as a result of controversy over her refusal to speak to the media during the tournament.\n\nOn Sunday a joint statement from Grand Slam organisers said Osaka could face expulsion from the tournament.\n\nThe 23-year-old said last week she would not do news conferences at Roland Garros to protect her mental health.\n\nShe said on Monday she \u201cnever wanted to be a distraction\u201d to the event.\n\nIn a tweet, Osaka revealed she had \u201csuffered long bouts of depression\u201d since winning her first Grand Slam title in 2018.\n\nThe Japanese four-time major winner added that she gets \u201chuge waves of anxiety\u201d before speaking to the world\u2019s media.\n\nOsaka said she was going to \u201ctake some time away from the court now\u201d, adding: \u201cWhen the time is right I really want to work with the Tour to discuss ways we can make things better for the players, press and fans\u201d.\n\nWhen Osaka announced her decision to avoid the press on Wednesday, she said expecting players to answer questions after a defeat amounted to \u201ckicking a person while they\u2019re down\u201d.\n\nThe French Open second seed won her opening match against Romania\u2019s Patricia Maria Tig in straight sets and was fined $15,000 (\u00a310,570) for not doing post-match media.\n\n\u2018A situation I never imagined\u2019 \u2013 Osaka\u2019s statement in full\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a situation I ever imagined or intended when I posted a few days ago. I think now the best thing for the tournament, the other players and my wellbeing is that I withdraw so that everyone can get back to focusing on the tennis going on in Paris.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to be a distraction and I accept my timing was not ideal and my message could have been clearer. More importantly, I would never trivialise mental health or use the term lightly.\n\n\u201cThe truth is I have suffered long bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.\n\n\u201cAnyone that knows me knows I am introverted and anyone that has seen me at tournaments will notice that I\u2019m often wearing headphones as that helps dull my social anxiety.\n\n\u201cThough the tennis press has always been kind to me (and I want to apologise to all the cool journalists who I may have hurt), I am not a natural public speaker and get huge waves of anxiety before I speak to the world\u2019s media.\n\n\u201cI get really nervous and find it stressful to always try to engage and give you the best answers I can.\n\n\u201cSo here in Paris I was already feeling vulnerable and anxious, so I thought it was better to exercise self-care and skip the press conferences. I announced it preemptively because I do feel like the rules are quite outdated in parts and I wanted to highlight that.\n\n\u201cI wrote privately to the tournament apologising and saying that I would be more than happy to speak with them after the tournament as the Slams are intense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take some time away from the court now, but when the time is right I really want to work with the Tour to discuss ways we can make things better for the players, press and fans.\u201d\n\nThe story so far\n\nMany athletes, both in and out of tennis, applauded Osaka\u2019s stance after she announced it on Wednesday, although many said speaking to the media is \u201cpart of the job\u201d.\n\nGrand Slam rules state players can be fined up to $20,000 (\u00a314,160) for failing to meet their media obligations, with the Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) saying players \u201chave a responsibility to their sport and their fans\u201d to speak to the media during competitions.\n\nFollowing her win over Tig, Osaka did take part in the usual on-court interview with the victor.\n\nLater on Sunday, organisers of the four Grand Slams released a joint statement saying Osaka could face \u201cmore substantial fines and future Grand Slam suspensions\u201d for her decision.\n\nThe Grand Slams added that following Osaka\u2019s announcement on Wednesday, Roland Garros teams had asked her to reconsider her position and were unsuccessful in their attempts to check on her wellbeing.\n\nAfter a \u201clack of engagement\u201d from Osaka, the Grand Slam organisers wrote to her to offer support, as well as to \u201cremind her of her obligations\u201d.\n\nIn response, the two-time Australian Open champion tweeted: \u201cAnger is a lack of understanding. Change makes people uncomfortable\u201d.\n\nThe following day, Osaka announced her decision to withdraw from the tournament altogether.",

Colombia was removed as co-host on May 20 as street protests against President Iv\u00e1n Duque rocked the nation.\n\nCONMEBOL said on Twitter that the tournament is confirmed to take place between June 13 and July 10. Brazil is the defending champion, winning the competition in 2019 as hosts.\n\n\u201cThe host cities and the fixtures will be confirmed by CONMEBOL within hours. The oldest international tournament in the world will make the whole continent cheer!\u201d the South American body said.\n\n\u201cCONMEBOL thanks President Jair Bolsonaro and his team, and also the Brazilian soccer confederation for opening the doors of this country for the safest sporting event in the world today. South America will shine in Brazil with all its stars,\u201d the soccer body said.\n\nMore than 460,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Brazil, with many analysts expecting another wave of the disease to hit the country by late June.

          "text": "China has explained her role in the blockade of Taiwan from attending recently held World Health Assembly.\n\nA statement from the spokesman of Chinese Embassy in Nigeria, Zhang Hang said China could have unilaterally block Taiwan from attending the United Nations organized function, insisting that the decision was taking by over 80 countries.\n\nZhang said the decision was taken by allies of China across the world who believe in a United China which include Taiwan.\n\nZhang, in the statement said: \u201cI was caught by surprise to read in a local newspaper an article entitled \u201cTaiwan\u2019s exclusion from the World Health Assembly undermines global health\u201d by Her Excellency Mary Beth Leonard, U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, indicating China wrongfully blocked Taiwan from participating at the WHA.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigerians and everyone else across the globe should be interested in what actually happened.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn May 24, The General Committee and the Plenary session of the 74th WHA respectively decided to reject the so-called proposal of \u201cinviting Taiwan to participate in the WHA as an observer\u201d submitted by certain countries. Can China succeed in doing this alone? No, actually among 194 members of World Health Organization, more than 150 countries, including Nigeria voiced their support for China, and more than 80 countries sent letters to WHO to express their commitment to the one-China principle and opposition to Taiwan\u2019s participation in the WHA.\u201d\n\nHe asked: \u201cWere all these countries wrong? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nZhang said: \u201cWHO is an international organization only sovereign country can join. Taiwan is not a sovereign country, it is an inalienable part of China. The Resolution 2758 of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in October 1971 and the Resolution 25.1 of WHA in May 1972 had already provided the legal basis for the WHO to abide by the one-China principle, and recognized Taiwan as part of China.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cOne-China principle is an international consensus and adhered by 180 countries including the U.S.A..\n\nTaiwan region\u2019s participation in the WHA must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle and through cross-strait consultations. The incumbent authorities in the Taiwan region since 2016 obstinately adhered to the separatist position of \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d and refused to recognize that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China. As a result, the political foundation for the Taiwan region to participate in WHA has ceased to exist.\u201d\n\nZhang added that: \u201cBased on the one-China principle, the Central Government of China has made appropriate arrangements for the Taiwan region\u2019s participation in global health affairs. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Central Government of China has sent 260 notifications on COVID-19 to Taiwan region. Health experts in Taiwan region have participated in 16 WHO technical activities.\n\n\u201cThe WHO Secretariat briefed health experts in Taiwan region several times on pandemic information. The so-called \u201cinternational epidemic prevention gap\u201d does not exist, nor do experts of Taiwan region lack channels and platforms to share response and control practices with others.\u201d\n\nHe however said as COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage globally, it is high time for responsible international community members to show solidarity, instead of politicizing health issues and interfering with other countries\u2019 internal affairs.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
