          "text": "The crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party may be resolved soon as the national leadership of the party said it will set up a committee that would meet with aggrieved party members in the state.\n\nThe party also stated that it is set to capture power from the All Progressives Congress at the federal level in 2023.\n\nThe party has been engulfed in crisis since Governor Godwin Obaseki was elected on its platform with those who defected with the governor from the APC not getting recognised in their new party.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday at a rally in Benin that had members of the Board of Trustees, National Working Committee, senators, members of the House of Representatives and other leaders of the party across the three senatorial zones of the state in attendance, the chairman of the party\u2019s BoT, Wali Jibrin, said the leadership of the party was already working to ensure that the party remains one in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe governor is a great governor and he is recognised by the party. I will beg Edo people to work together and support to the governor. The governor left the APC for the PDP and we are not going to send him away.\n\n\u201cThe PDP will do whatever it could to make sure that this governor remains at the saddle.\n\n\u201cVery soon, the BoT will form a committee that will be here to ensure that there is unity and will give support to the PDP, so the next election will be all PDP.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, the party\u2019s national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, said reconciliatory moves would start next week to resolve the crisis in the state.\n\nAyu said he is married to an Edo woman who has five children for him, asking, \u201cWill I allow the party in my state to fall apart? My brothers and sisters, divided we fall, united we stand.\n\n\u201cFor many years, it was difficult to bring democracy to Nigeria because we politicians were divided until one day, a Fulani man called Abubakar Rimi went to Adamu Ciroma and said we are divided because we say we are progressives and conservatives.\u201d\n\nAyu said many people who have left the PDP are coming back and that many more would come back by next month that would shock Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI led this party in 1999 to conquer the villa in 2023. We shall be back in power in the Presidential Villa and we have already started making the moves. We will go after all the former governors who left the party. A team would be sent to settle whatever differences are in the party in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the governor of the state, Godwin Obaseki, said the party was poised to retain power in the state, reiterating the position of his deputy, Philip Shaibu, who said that the state would determine the mood of Nigerians in the next general election as \u201cwherever Edo people go, Nigerians will go.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2022Russia\u2019s demand amounts to a surrender \u2014 Kuleba, Ukraine Foreign Minister\n\n\u2022Putin says Russia will emerge stronger, sanctions will rebound\n\nBy Victoria Ojeme (with additional agency reports)\n\nThe Federal Government yesterday said 122 persons plus an infant from Warsaw, Poland will arrive the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport today, Friday, March 11, 2022 at the estimated time of 12:40am aboard Air Peace..\n\nIn a statement made available to newsmen by spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Francisca K. Omayuli, said, \u201cIn continuation of the evacuation exercise, the second flight comprising 122 persons plus an infant from Warsaw, Poland will arrive the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport on Friday, 11th March, 2022 at the estimated time of 12:40am aboard Air Peace.\n\n\u201cA third evacuation flight will depart at 8.00am from Budapest, Hungary to Abuja on Saturday, 12th March 2022. Interested Nigerians fleeing Ukraine should contact:Nigerian Embassy Budapest, Hungary on Tel. No. +36308202903 or +36308639203, email: [email protected] Or [email protected]\n\nSo far, a total number of 1,076 Nigerians fleeing the crisis in Ukraine, have been evacuated back to Nigeria. The evacuees will be received at the airport in Abuja by Edward Adedokun, Director, Search and Rescue of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA); officials of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nA first round of talks between the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine has failed to yield progress on a ceasefire, Dmytro Ivanovych Kuleba, Ukraine Minister of Foreign Affairs said. Speaking after the meeting in Turkey, Kuleba, said that the demands his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov had made amounted to a surrender.\n\nMr Lavrov meanwhile said his country\u2019s military operation was going to plan.\n\nThe talks come after Russia bombed a children\u2019s hospital, which Ukraine said was a \u201cwar crime\u201d.\n\nOfficials say three people including a child died in the attack in the south-eastern city of Mariupol.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine two weeks ago and more than 2.3 million people have since fled the country.\n\nThe worst humanitarian situation was in Mariupol, Mr Kuleba said, where residents have been trapped for days in freezing temperatures without electricity or water.\n\nBut Russia had not committed to establishing a humanitarian corridor there and had also not responded to proposals for a 24-hour humanitarian ceasefire across Ukraine, he said.\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender,\u201d he said, adding that he was willing to continue meeting.\n\nFor his part, the Russian foreign minister offered no concessions and repeated demands that Ukraine be disarmed and accept neutral status. Moscow was waiting for a reply from Kyiv, he said.\n\nMr Lavrov also accused the West of fuelling the conflict by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nRussia would cope with Western sanctions and \u201ccome out of the crisis with a better psychology and conscience\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cI assure you we will cope and will do everything not to rely on the West ever, in any areas of our lives,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin says Russia will emerge stronger, sanctions will rebound\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said sanctions imposed against Russia would rebound against the West, including in the form of higher food and energy prices, and Moscow would solve its problems and emerge stronger.\n\nPutin said there had been no alternative to what Russia calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine and that Russia was not a country that could accept compromising its sovereignty for some sort of short-term economic gain.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions would have been imposed in any case,\u201d Putin told a meeting of the Russian government yesterday. \u201cThere are some questions, problems and difficulties but in the past we have overcome them and we will overcome them now.\n\n\u201cIn the end, this will all lead to an increase in our independence, self-sufficiency and our sovereignty,\u201d he told a televised government meeting two weeks after Russian forces invaded neighbouring Ukraine.\n\nHis comments were designed to portray Western sanctions as self-defeating and reassure Russians that the country can withstand what Moscow is calling an \u201ceconomic war\u201d against its banks, businesses and business oligarchs.\n\nPutin said Moscow \u2013 a major energy producer that supplies a third of Europe\u2019s gas \u2013 would continue to meet its contractual obligations even though it has been slammed with comprehensive sanctions including a ban on United States purchases of its oil.\n\n\u201cThey announced that they are closing the import of Russian oil to the American market. Prices there are high, inflation is unprecedentedly high, has reached historic highs. They are trying to blame the results of their own mistakes on us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have absolutely nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nHitting back against the West, the Russian government said earlier that it had banned exports of telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, among other items, until the end of 2022.\n\nRussian weapons\u2019ll defy no-fly zone, US DIA director says\n\nA no-fly zone over Ukraine would not protect against many of the weapons Russian forces are using in Ukraine right now, said U.S Defense Intelligence Agency Director, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier.\n\nRussian forces are using \u201ca combination of mostly missiles, artillery, multiple rocket launchers. There are some precision guided munitions that are being dropped from aircraft, but that number is small,\u201d Berrier said in an exchange with Sen. Angus King. A no-fly zone would not protect against \u201cinhibit missiles, rockets and artillery,\u201d Berrier added.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked NATO allies and the United States to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The airspace over Ukraine remains contested, a senior US defense official told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) predicts the war in Ukraine will push levels of consumer inflation up even further in the near term.\n\n\u201cThe Russia-Ukraine war will have a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence,\u201d ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a speech yesterday.\n\nLagarde said the impact of the conflict could push inflation in the euro area \u2013 which hit 5.8% in February \u2013 \u201cconsiderably higher in the near term,\u201d but is still expected to decline progressively to the central bank\u2019s 2% target in 2024.\n\nFinancial sanctions against Russia, which include the banning of some Russian banks from the SWIFT payment network, have not yet caused problems for European banks, she said.\n\n\u201c(Sanctions) have so far not caused severe strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the euro area banking system,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cBank balance sheets remain healthy overall, owing to robust capital positions and fewer non-performing loans.\u201d\n\nFormer Ukrainian president addresses citizens: \u201cHere\u2019s to our future. For our freedom\u201d\n\nFormer Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, who led the country from 1994-2005, published an appeal to the Ukrainian people yesterday. The appeal was published on the Facebook page of Kuchma\u2019s press secretary, Darka Olifer.\n\nHalf of Kyiv\u2019s population has fled, mayor says\n\nHalf the population of Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv have fled since the invasion began, its mayor Vitali Klitschko says, as Russian forces move ever closer to the city.\n\nKlitschko, the former heavyweight boxing champion, says: \u201cKyiv has been transformed into a fortress. Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified.\u201d\n\nJust under two million people, from the city\u2019s population of around three million, have left, he says.\n\nRussian forces are believed to have rolled their armoured vehicles up to the north-eastern edge of the city today. Overnight, there was heavy fighting for control of the main road into the city.\n\nWestern officials, meanwhile, are warning of \u201cunprecedented movements of people\u201d fleeing Ukraine, saying the number of refugees could hit four million within the coming days.\n\nFormer German Chancellor visiting Moscow\n\nGerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former German leader, is visiting Moscow today for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Politico reports.\n\nHe\u2019s visiting with the intention of holding mediation talks with Putin in order to end the war in Ukraine, Politico says, referring to \u201csources familiar with the matter\u201d.\n\nZelensky: We will rebuild Ukraine\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has been delivering an address urging Ukraine\u2019s partners around the world to deliver solutions based in reality \u2013 not on abstract opinions.\n\nHe says leaders are getting together to discuss the war and Ukraine\u2019s membership of Nato \u2013 and makes the point that he knows which of those leaders are supporting Ukraine.\n\nOn the war, he says Ukrainian men and women are defending their state for the fifteenth day \u2013 and have been repelling attacks in key areas.\n\nHe confirms three people, including one child, were killed in the Mariupol maternity hospital bombing and says Russia\u2019s claim that there were no patients in the hospital is a lie.\n\nThe Russians have created a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d, he says, adding: \u201cMy heart is broken by what the occupiers have done to our cities, to our state.\u201d\n\nHe says Russia wants to humiliate the Ukrainian people and \u201cmake them kneel and take bread and water from their hands\u201d.\n\nZelensky adds: \u201cWe did not become slaves and we never will \u2013 because this is our spirit and this is our destiny.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, he says that after the war, everything will be rebuilt to the highest standard, and planning by the government is already under way. \u201cThere will be no trace left of the Russian invasion.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs to exit Russia\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc has said it is closing its operations in Russia, becoming the first major Wall Street bank to exit the country over Moscow\u2019s invasion.\n\n\u201cGoldman Sachs is winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements,\u201d the Reuters news agency quoted the bank as saying in an emailed statement.\n\nUkrainian strike destroys Russian tanks\n\nFootage has emerged showing Russian tanks being destroyed in a barrage of Ukrainian artillery fire.\n\nThe footage, which you can view below, appears to have been taken by a drone and has been verified and geo-located by the BBC to a town north-east of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.\n\nAllegedly accompanying the video is a conversation between a Russian officer, who identified himself by the codename Nitro, reporting the ambush to his superiors.\n\nHe reports that \u201cthere are very many casualties\u201d and that \u201cthe regiment commander has died\u201d in the strike.\n\nThe convoy was targeted by \u201cartillery, tanks, drones and Bayraktar (a Turkish made drone)\u201d, he adds.",

          "text": "\u2022As Igariwey, PDP named successor demands CoR from INEC\n\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri & Levinus Nwabughiogu\n\nABUJA\u2014The embattled Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi and his Deputy, Dr. Eric Igwe, yesterday, approached the Federal High Court in Abuja, praying it to stay the execution of the judgment that sacked them from their respective offices, following their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nThis came as the PDP named successor of the governor, Iduma Igariwey, asked the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to immediately issue him and his deputy, Fred Udogu, Certificates of return, CoR, for them to be sworn in as new governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi State.\n\nUmahi and Igwe, in a motion on notice they filed through their team of lawyers led by Mr. Chukwuma Ma-Chukwu Ume, SAN, urged the court to also suspend the alternative order that directed the INEC to conduct fresh governorship election in the state, in accordance with section 177(c) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\nThey prayed the court to stay execution of the order that mandated INEC to receive from the PDP, names of its candidates to replace them, as well as the order that restrained the electoral body from further recognising them as the governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi State, respectively.\n\nMore so, the Applicants, want the high court to stay the execution of the order restraining them from putting themselves out as governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi State, pending the hearing and determination of the appeal they have lodged before the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\nBoth Umahi and Igwe, applied for an order to restrain the PDP from submitting any names to the INEC for the purpose of declaring them as governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi State in replacement of the Applicants, and if already submitted and accepted, to issue an order of injunction, restraining INEC from using Certificate of Return or putting same into effect, pending the conclusion of the appeal.\n\nThey are further seeking an order restraining INEC from conducting elections into their offices and or declaraing the names of any candidate presented by the PDP as the governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi state.\n\nTheir application, which was anchored on order 26 rules 1 and 2(1) and order 32 rules 1 and 4(1) of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2019, was predicated on eight grounds.\n\nThe application was filed before Justice Inyang Ekwo, who delivered the judgment that is being challenged at the appellate court.\n\nUmahi and his deputy told the court that they were totally dissatisfied with the judgment and have accordingly gone before the appellate court to challenge it.\n\nThey averred that the notice of appeal has been dully served on all the parties, saying they had since commenced the process for the compilation and transmission of the records of the appeal in the matter.\n\nThey maintained that the outcome of their appeal would be rendered nugatory, unless the court suspends the execution of the judgment.\n\nThe Appellants averred that their appeal raised \u201csubstantial, recondite and arguable issues of law with reasonable chances of success\u201d.\n\nThey said their rights would be highly jeopardized if the judgment of the court is allowed to be executed before the determination of the pending appeal.\n\nTheir lawyer, Ume, SAN, argued that one of the serious grounds of the appeal, is the substantial issue of jurisdiction, which he said constitutes exceptional circumstance in consideration to which the law permits the grant of stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of the Applicant\u2019s appeal.\n\nIn a related development, the 16 lawmakers of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly that were also asked to vacate their seats by the court, equally filed a motion to stay the execution of the judgment against them, pending the hearing and determination of their appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP named successor of Dave Umahi, while briefing journalists yesterday, among others, said \u201cApart from the order directing Governor Umahi and his deputy to vacate their offices, the court, inter alia, also directed INEC to immediately receive its candidates to replace Governor David Umahi and his deputy as names submitted by the PDP, as the Governor and the deputy Governor of Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge that INEC is in receipt of the communication from the National Chairman of the PDP, we call on INEC as a critical pillar of our constitutional democracy to comply expeditiously with all the consequential orders of the court particularly by declaring the names submitted by the PDP as Governor and Deputy Governor. This, the INEC is expected to do, by issuing Certificates of Return.\u201d",
          "summary": "This came as the PDP named successor of the governor, Iduma Igariwey, asked the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to immediately issue him and his deputy, Fred Udogu, Certificates of return, CoR, for them to be sworn in as new governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi State.\nThey are further seeking an order restraining INEC from conducting elections into their offices and or declaraing the names of any candidate presented by the PDP as the governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi state.\nThe application was filed before Justice Inyang Ekwo, who delivered the judgment that is being challenged at the appellate court.\nUmahi and his deputy told the court that they were totally dissatisfied with the judgment and have accordingly gone before the appellate court to challenge it.\nThey maintained that the outcome of their appeal would be rendered nugatory, unless the court suspends the execution of the judgment.",

          "text": ".\n\nFormer President Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has charged members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Parliament to champion national processes that would strengthen democracy and improve governance in West Africa, as a means of reversing the trend of military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and growing social tension in the region.\n\nThe former President stated this while addressing the First Extraordinary Session of the Fifth ECOWAS Parliament which has just ended in Monrovia, Liberia. Describing the Parliament as the soul and heart of democracy, Dr Jonathan urged the parliamentarians to seek to protect democracy in West Africa by making laws that would guarantee the independence of the electoral management bodies, ensure electronic voting, safeguard rule of law and protect constitutional term limits.\n\nSpeaking on the place of credible elections in a democracy, Dr. Jonathan stated: \u201cThe parliament should seriously consider the imperative of protecting the independence of electoral management bodies to ensure that electoral processes are transparent, free, fair and acceptable to stakeholders. We have to grow our democracy to a level where people will believe that their votes will count. That will only be possible if they have confidence in the impartiality and neutrality of electoral management bodies.\u201d\n\nThe former president who is ECOWAS mediator in Mali also reiterated his call for the adoption of electronic voting in ECOWAS nations, adding that the deployment of technology and automation would sanitise electoral processes by reducing the high incidence of electoral malpractices such ballot box stuffing, results falsification, thuggery and violence during elections.\n\nDr. Jonathan who shared his mediation experience in Mali while featuring on a panel that focused on the \u2018Impact of the Mediation of Special Envoys on the Operationalisation of the ECOWAS Mediation Mechanisms\u2019 further advised the lawmakers to pass laws that would strengthen their national constitutions in order to protect democratic values and practices.\n\nAlong this line, Dr. Jonathan pointed out the danger posed by the lack of provisions for the impeachment of elected leaders in the constitution of some West African countries, adding that such a situation ties the hands of citizens in legally expressing their democratic rights.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cHaving a provision for impeachment in the constitution can help defuse social tension. This is because it gives people the hope that they can legally remove erring leaders, rather than always resorting to public demonstrations which often lead to violence, to protest lack of confidence in an elected leader.\u201d\n\nThe former President also charged the leaders to deepen the engagement on the processes that would improve economic growth and promote development. He also made a case for the consolidation of the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) to fund small businesses and agriculture, especially adding value to farm and forest produce.\n\nFor democracy to serve the people well, Dr. Jonathan further noted that development, economic growth and welfare of citizens have to be prioritised by leaders. \u201cWhen the economies of various nations are doing well, more jobs will be created and it will be difficult for young people to be recruited for causes that promote crime and violence.\u201d",

Kyari stressed that the fuel is a deregulated product and the landing cost is N418 per litre.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of Air Peace said they should bring it to N200 per litre.\n\n\u201cAs of today, the landing cost of ATK is N418 per litre, we have no control over that, the only way is to subsidize it,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nOther operators who spoke at the hearing also echoed what Onyema said.\n\nThe CEO of Overland, Captain Edward Boyo, said the country risks putting planes at risk if action is not taken to regulate the price of Jet A1 fuel.\n\nIn his ruling, the Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase said the Committee will meet again on Monday to hear from the fuel marketers.\n\nHe directed the NNPC limited boss to work with all relevant authorities to crash the price of jet fuel.",

But in line with International Women\u2019s Day, the female custodial facilities commemorated International Women\u2019s Day with inmates, various inmates without distinction or discrimination against anybody \u2013 an inmate is an inmate.\n\n\u201cAll the inmates in different cell blocks presented various programmes. Some did theatre presentations, others drama, some poetry, some beauty pageant, some drawings, paintings, comedy. So, various blocks won. It was just like an inter-cell block event.\n\n\u201cThere were lots of presentations. It was not an individual thing. It was just the facility\u2019s way of trying to reform the inmates, those still in custody.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why they commemorated International Women\u2019s Day, that\u2019s why it was done in the female facility, not the male.\u201d\n\nReferring to Ojukwu, the spokesman said: \u201cThe particular inmate, I don\u2019t know her name. There were various winners. The costumes were made by the inmates in the facility and some of the winners got sponsorship to pay for their UME forms, NECO, WASSCE and higher education.\n\nSome donated libraries to us, apart from some other stationery, and welfare resources. It was not an individual event, so the prizes were collective.\u201d\n\nHe explained that Chidinma could have been a representative of a block.",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli and Jide Orintunsin Abuja\n\nYobe Governor, Sani Bello differ on transfer of functions\n\nTinubu: party should remain democratic\n\nThe ousted caretaker chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mai Mala Buni, is due in London to confer with President Muhammadu Buhari, it was learnt last night.\n\nSources said Buni, who was expected to rush back home on Wednesday from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where he went for medical checkup, had a rethink.\n\n\u201cHe will now travel to London to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari on the situation in the party,\u201d a source said.\n\nAttorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN), it was learnt, had arrived in London also to meet with the President.\n\nAnother official listed to meet with the President is Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele.\n\nIt could not be confirmed last night whether the CBN governor had arrived in the UK capital.\n\nAhead of his London trip, there was a leak of Buni\u2019s letter, which faulted Governor Nasir El-Rufai\u2019s narratives on how Buni was removed as chairman of Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nA source, who spoke in confidence, said the APC crisis has shifted to London with Buni struggling for survival.\n\nThe source added: \u201cInstead of coming home, Buni went London to state his own side of the crisis in the party and hear from the President on whether or not he directed that he should leave office. He has also gone there with facts and figures on the situation of the party.\n\n\u201cHe has insisted that no verbal or written directive was given to him by the President. He said he cannot depend on third party information. He wants to know his fate directly from the President.\n\n\u201cI think Buni and his backers have succeeded in breaking some protocol barriers to see the President, who has been under pressure to hear the other side to APC crisis.\n\n\u201cBuni confided in some governors and few loyalists that he would clarify a few things in London including court injunction to halt the convention and defiance of presidential directives on the reform of the party.\u201d\n\nIn Buni\u2019s letter, the Yobe State governor legally handed over the affairs of the party to Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello before travelling out.\n\nIn the letter dated February 28, Buni directed Governor Bello to act in his absence as the chairman of CECPC.\n\nA copy of the letter was sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and members of CECPC.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cThis is to please inform you that I will be embarking on a medical trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from today, 28th February, 2022.\n\n\u201cIn my absence, I hereby transmit the functions of my office as the National Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to you.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the committee conclude all arrangements leading to the National Convention slated for March 26th, 2022 and other duties that may be required of the office.\n\n\u201cI invite all members to cooperate with Governor Abubakar Sani Bello by extending to him all the support that I have enjoyed from you.\n\n\u201cPlease do accept the assurances of my best regards.\u201d\n\nHowever, Sani Bello denied receiving any transfer of authority letter from Buni. Speaking to reporters at the secretariat in Abuja, Sani Bello simply said: \u201cI have not seen it.\u201d\n\nAn aide to Buni, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cBuni couldn\u2019t have been removed by anybody or a group of governors because his letter was explicit. He followed due process and nominated Bello to act for him.\u201d\n\nOn Emefiele, a source said: \u201cHis mission was to brief the President on developments on the economy, particularly the effect of the Russia-Ukraine war on our earnings as well as the resultant huge subsidy on fuel.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cEmefiele might discuss his perceived presidential ambition with Buhari, in view of the Senate\u2019s rejection of President Buhari\u2019s request to amend a section of the new Electoral Act, which precludes appointed officials of government from voting or being voted for at primaries of political parties, unless they resign.\u201d\n\nMalami is expected, according to sources, to discuss some constitutional and legal issues with Buhari.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s rejection of a presidential request to review Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 was said to be a source of concern to the Presidency.\n\nIt was learnt that the President and the AGF are likely to weigh options on the Electoral Act in line with the time constraint before the 2023 primaries begin in April.\n\nOne of the alternatives being considered was to approach the court for a pronouncement.\n\nThe sack of Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi by a Federal High Court will also feature because Malami was yet to issue an advisory on the judgment.\n\nAnother source added: \u201cThe AGF is in London to discuss the implications of the Senate\u2019s rejection of a gentleman\u2019s agreement with the President on Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act. The President needs legal advice on whether or not those in his cabinet and states\u2019 executive councils should resign before the primaries.\n\n\u201cBuhari may rub minds with the AGF on any legal window which the government may explore to file an action in court.\n\n\u201cSome parties are already in court. So, the most important aspect is the implication of any court verdict on Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act on the 2023 general election. We are in dire straits because some Senators claimed that they cannot review the Electoral Act because it will affect the timetable for the 2023 poll.\n\n\u201cYet, the fear of the President is that some political office holders will be disenfranchised. So, Buhari sees the Electoral Act as a violation of the fundamental human rights of those in political offices.\n\n\u201cMalami, believed to be interested in contesting to be governor of Kebbi State and others like the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, Babatunde Fashola (Works), Uche Ogah (Mines and Steel), Chris Ngige (Labour and Employment), Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu (Science and Technology) and Festus Keyamo (SAN) (Minister of State for Labour and Employment) are affected.\n\nThe source added: \u201cThe removal of Governor Umahi by a Federal High Court and the dilemma APC is facing on the injunction against its March 26 convention are other legal matters which are sources of concern to the President.\n\n\u201cIf the injunction is not vacated, APC cannot hold its National Convention. The party can defy the court by holding the convention and living with the consequences. This is why there is so much anger in the party.\n\n\u201cSince the sack of Umahi, the AGF has not made his position known as the Chief Legal Officer of the Federation. He is in London to share his views before addressing the nation.\n\n\u201cThe manner in which Umahi attacked the Judiciary made most APC members to be upset with him. The AGF will also offer his advice.\u201d",

He did not name the four governors that are not with them.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who is on two-week medical vacation in London, it was gathered, has rebuffed lobbyists trying to bring back Buni.\n\nBuni and Caretaker Secretary James Akpanudoedehe have been excluded from the revised caretaker committee, inaugurated yesterday by acting Chairman Sani Bello.\n\nThe party announced March 17 for the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.\n\nEl-Rufai said the governors met with President Buhari on Sunday, shortly before his London trip to obtain his approval for the plan to proceed with preparations for the convention and to hold a NEC meeting to ratify critical decision ons way the forward.\n\nHe confirmed that an injunction has been obtained following a request from the court by a party member to the effect that the party should not hold its convention until his grievances have been addressed.\n\nEl-Rufai, who said Buni was aware and neither informed the party nor did anything on it, said efforts had commenced now to vacate the injunction which he described as \u201ca weapon of mass destruction\u201d, planned to use to scuttle the convention.\n\nHe said the fate of caretaker secretary James Akpanudoedehe had been decided after he refused to take instruction from acting Chairman Bello who took over on Monday.\n\nEl-Rufai said: \u201cWe got a wind of a court process wherein an order had been gotten directing that the convention should not be held until the determination of the case. And it was unfortunate that, our lawyer engaged by Buni-led committee agreed with this in court. If this remains, how can the convention be done?\n\n\u201cWe got signals that there were some elements in the party that were bent on scuttling the proposed March 26 convention.\n\n\u201cAnd if we miss that date, the following Saturday, will be Ramadan and that means we would not be able to have convention until after Ramadan. That means we would have lost another month according to INEC\u2019s timetable.\n\n\u201cBased on this, we met with the president to discuss a number of issues with him like zoning formulae, which the president signed off on.\n\n\u201cWe went the second time to inform the president that the zoning formula he signed off on had not been sent back to us.\n\n\u201cInstead, we were hearing about another list, which we knew was not from Mr. President.\n\n\u201cThe President agreed with us and directed that with immediate effect, Governor Buni must go and that Governor Bello should take over the headship of the party.\n\n\u201cThe president directed that we must do everything possible to ensure the convention holds. I can tell you that Bello has the full backing of the president and at least 19 of the 23 APC governors. Then, you can see that since Monday that Bello took over, we have made a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nAsked if their action was constitutional, El-Rufai said: \u201cWe had to intervene when we saw that the party was drifting and we are happy and satisfied with our action, though some didn\u2019t want the party to progress.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that some politicians\u2019 ambition was putting the party at risk and the President was not happy when he heard about the sinister motive.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that Mai Mala has stepped aside and I can assure you that when he returns to the country, he will not assume any position.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any personal disagreement with Mai Mala Buni, as he was also a victim of many of the intrigues that played out.\u201d\n\nOn the secretary, he said: \u201cThe CECCP has taken action on the secretary and I believe that whatever they do is done in accordance with the law.\n\n\u201cWe want to send the message to everyone that the party is no longer at risk and we are already reaching out to all sides and camps within the party.",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nA move to reject the bill was signalled by a call from Adamu Aliero for the Electoral Act amendment bill to be stepped down after the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, moved a motion for it to be read a second time. Aliero, who came under a Point of Order, drew the attention of his colleagues to the provision of Rule 52(5) of the Senate Standing Order.\n\nOrder 52(5) provides that: \u201cReference shall not be made to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending, in such a way as might in the opinion of the president of the Senate prejudice the interest of parties thereto.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, advised the upper chamber to step down the consideration of the bill pending the vacation of a court order delivered by the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday.\n\nHe said going ahead with the amendment of the Act was in clear conflict with the sub-judice rule in law which prevents the legislature from deliberating or considering any matter already before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cWe should not be seen to be disobeying the court order.

Click Here Now .\n\nAccording to the list, the position of Deputy National Chairman (South) and National Treasurer have been zoned to the South East while the National Auditor and Deputy National Chairman (North) were zoned to the North East.\n\nApart from producing the national chairmanship, the North-central will also produce Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary and Zonal Secretary among other positions.\n\nSome of the other positions for the national leadership zoned to the South-south include National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary among others.\n\nThe South West apart from the position of National Secretary will produce National Youth Leader, National Physically Challenged Leader and Deputy National Auditor among other zonal positions.\n\nOther positions zoned to the South East include, National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary and National Ex \u2013 Officio Member among other zonal positions like Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader and Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD).\n\nHowever, security agents have re-occupied the national secretariat of the party, grounding movement along the Blantyre Street.\n\nThe security agents had arrived the Buhari House in the early hours with instruction of who to allow into the secretariat complex.\n\nCuriously, the Secretary Caretaker Committee, Senator Akpanudoedehe, was nowhere near the secretariat despite denying his resignation on Tuesday.\n\nReacting to the leadership shenanigans rocking the party, a member of Governor Buni\u2019s kitchen cabinet lambasted some members of the Progressive Governors Forum for stabbing the Yobe State governor on his hospital bed.\n\nOur source claimed that some of the governors had gone to feed President Muhammadu Buhari with all manners of concocted lies against Governor Buni while he was still on his hospital bed outside the country.\n\n\u201cThey waited for him to leave the country for surgery before going to President Buhari to paint him black. Since he was not around to defend the baseless allegations against him, they claimed that Buhari has endorsed him removal. But they got it all wrong because it has no constitutional backing.\u201d\n\nDismissing their actions and activities carried out so far by the Governor Bello-led CECPC without the endorsement of the secretary as a nullity, the source claimed that the current leadership lacked the recognition of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).",

          "text": "\u2022How ex-CECPC chair bungled soft-landing option\n\n\u2022Four major decisions Bello took in four days\n\n\u2022Party discovers secret court order obtained to stop convention\n\n\u2022NEC meets next Thursday\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\n\n\n\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, technically confirmed the sack of the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni and Senator James Akpanudoedehe as chairman and national secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) respectively, after excluding them from the central planning committee of the party.\n\nWith the new list of the convention committees, the names of Buni and Akpanudoedehe,were conspicuously missing as the ruling party continued its preparation for the March 26 national convention.\n\nAlthough there had been plans to offer Buni and Akpanudoedehe a soft-landing, so that it would not seem as though the party embarrassed them, the fact that Buni was foot-dragging and Akpanudoedehe continued to live in self-denial, coupled with the fact that the party needed to move as fast as possible to catch up with the proposed date for its national convention, took the offer off the table.\n\nFrom all indications, therefore, the acting Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, has taken over as the head of the Central Planning Committee, the main group meant to be headed by Buni if he was still in charge.\n\nIn the same stroke, the name of Akpanudoedehe did not feature in any of the committees, not even as the secretary of the central planning committee, an office he held till events took a different turn in the party this week.\n\nThis, nonetheless, many APC members were excited about the fact that the Bello leadership had taken four critical decisions in just four days, mainly the issues the Buni leadership made to appear impossible and by so doing, stalling the national convention of the party.\n\nThis is as the APC leadership has recently just discovered that there was a court order, obtained in cahoots with some members of the CECPC to prevent the convention from holding.\n\nReports also had it that the new leadership at the national headquarters of the party, actually ordered security agencies to prevent Akpanudoedehe from accessing the secretariat, since his services were no longer needed in any respect.\n\nHowever, with the leadership change and the current turn of events, a former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, has expressed confidence that the proposed March 26 date for the APC national convention was feasible.\n\nFrom the re-organisation and pruning down of the convention sub-committees, yesterday, at the secretariat by Bello, the Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Masari, would head the screening committee, while the President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan would chair the screening appeal committee.\n\nJigawa State Governor, Abubakar Badaru, would head the election committee, while the Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, heads the Election Appeal Committee.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, would head the legal committee, while David Umahi, will head the media committee, and to be assisted by the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, as co-chair, while the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello will head the security committee.\n\nBello, while inaugurating convention sub-committees, said, \u201cFor those of you that have been monitoring events in the national secretariat since Monday, we have started the effort to ensure that there is free and fair convention.\n\n\u201cWe have made efforts to see a successful convention and part of those efforts is to inaugurate chairmen and secretaries of the committees in consideration of tract records and loyalty to the party,\u201d he said.\n\nBello said he knew that a lot of party faithful wanted to serve in various committees as their support or contributions towards a healthy party, but added that everyone could not be accommodated in the committee.\n\nHis words: \u201cSo, we trimmed down the number to workable size without undermining everyone and I think this decision is the best for our party,\u201d he said, explaining also that the Caretaker Committee members went through hell compiling the list, because everyone wanted to serve.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t see your name in the list, please don\u2019t be offended. I\u2019m sure other opportunities will come in future. I want to remind you that you have to work hard to ensure that the national convention will go on, on 26th of March 2022. That day is sacrosanct, insha Allah.\u201d\n\nHe posited that, the task before the committees was to ensure the success of the convention.\n\nUnfortunately, ahead of yesterday\u2019s developments, the party had mulled the options of offering Buni and Akpanudoedehe a soft-landing such that what was going on in the party would not seem as if they were disgraced out of office, after engaging them to set the party on the path of progress.\n\nTHISDAY sources said since the idea was mooted and shared with Buni especially, he had acted as if the new development in the party was not going to stand, deliberately foot-dragging, and therefore forced other stakeholders to conclude that the party must move forward regardless.\n\nThe party source hinted that despite all the changes that were going on in the party, Buni still stayed back in Dubai, where he was alleged to be observing medical vacation, thus prompting the new developments regardless, even though an express sack of the two would have been announced, the source added.\n\nSome of the excited members of the party have also rejoiced at some of the happenings in the party, saying it was surprising that some of the things Buni made to appear impossible had been addressed in four days, pointing out four critical decisions.\n\nAccording to the stakeholder, who pleaded anonymity, \u201cIn four days, Bello has sworn in all the state chairmen of the parties of the party. That\u2019s one. Two, he has received the zoning report from the committee. Three, he has summoned the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, which is now slated for next Thursday, and four, he has just sworn in the national convention sub-committees of the party.\n\n\u201cWhat more can you say? There\u2019s clearly nothing esoteric in leadership for as long as there is capacity and competence, and that\u2019s all Bello has exhibited in just four days of taking over the party leadership and doing the simple things that almost threw the party into the abyss.\u201d\n\nBut, in a development that might have justified all the steps so far taken in the APC, the party leadership has just discovered how a court order was secretly obtained in November last year by a certain Salisu Umoru, which Buni was privy to and kept till the last minute, to stop the party from going ahead with the convention.\n\nJustice Bello Kawu of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) had in an exparte application delivered on November 18, 2021, restrained the APC and Buni \u201cfrom organising, holding or conducting the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in January and February 2022 or any other date before or after pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\n\nThe suit marked FCT/MC/CV2958/2021 was brought by Umoru, and had as respondents, the APC, Buni and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nTracing some of the events that led to the emergence of Bello to the failure of Buni to effect the directive of President Buhari on March 1, 2022, the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, said the president, having accepted the zoning formula, directed the immediate swearing-in of state chairmen, who were elected some months back in order to put machinery in place for the convention, but sadly the directives were ignored.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe president gave three directives. He said this is the zoning formula that is fairest to everyone, I will sit with all the aspirants from North Central and will try to get to agree to consensus around one candidate, when I come back from my trip. Thirdly, he said they should swear in the states chairmen; they were elected months ago and they have not been sworn in, and because they have not been sworn in, the states executive cannot function, they should be sworn in so that a date can be fixed.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the president added that they should give notice for an emergency national executive meeting, which he said required one week notice.\n\nHe noted that although Buni was not present in that meeting as he was said to be away on a medical trip, Bello who was a member of the caretaker committee, was mandated to pass the message to the caretaker committee to effect this action.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, said for days, no action was taken, saying, \u201cBuni travelled abroad on medical treatment and handed over to Bello as acting chairman while he was away. Bello now said let\u2019s implement the president\u2019s directives and the National Secretary just refused.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna governor said, following the refusal, the governors gathered on Sunday before the president left for his trip abroad to complain that, \u201cThere is no movement on this thing and we are hearing that there was a court order and we now saw that there was one.\u201d\n\nBut in spite of grandstanding and holding some face-saving media briefing on Tuesday, Akpanudoedehe failed to come to the party secretariat yesterday.\n\nIt was gathered that the security agents at the party secretariat were given clear orders not to allow Akpanudoedehe access to the secretariat.\n\nA party source, who preferred anonymity, said it was because of Akpanudoedehe that the security at the national secretariat was beefed up.\n\n\u201cIt was because of him that the security was beefed up. He has been asked to step aside and not to come close to the secretariat. We are in here for a serious matter now. We are preparing for the convention. March 26 is now sacrosanct. Before, when the Caretaker committee sits, you won\u2019t know what they discuss in the meeting. They will just come and eat and go,\u201d the source said.\n\nAlso, encouraged by the developments in the party, Okorocha, who spoke to journalists yesterday at the party secretariat, said with the new leadership in place, the March 26 convention was possibility.\n\n\u201cI can see light now at the dark end of the tunnel and I\u2019m more reassured more than ever that this convention will take place and it would be free and fair, given the leadership in place and given the stand of Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWhat simply needs to be done is to give every member of this party a sense of belonging, not forgetting the founding fathers and the parties that came together to form the APC.\n\n\u201cOne, which is the Congress of Progressives Change (CPC) led by President Muhammadu Buhari; the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) led by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) led by Rochas Okorocha; the All Nigerians Peoples Party (ANPP) led by Ogbonnaya Onu and Abdulaziz Yari and a host of others,\u201d he said.\n\nThe party chieftain noted that if these people were carried along and the governors were recognised as leaders of the party, the party would have a peaceful convention.\n\nHe stressed that the party should, as a matter of urgency, respect the rule of law and obey the court judgment and orders, where they exist, adding that when this is done, it would also give everyone a sense of belonging.\n\nThe former Imo governor said he came to the party secretariat to encourage the new leadership, give his word of advice and what should be done to move the party forward.\n\nAccording to him, APC remained the people\u2019s confidence, because the people believed in this party and \u201cif we hold this convention on the 26, it will restore the confidence of the people and members of this party\u201d.\n\nTo that extent, the governing APC leadership has approved the zoning of party offices, ahead of the convention.\n\nThis was contained in a statement, yesterday, by its Director of Publicity, Mr. Salisu \u018aambatta.\n\n\u201cDuring its regular meeting on March 8, 2022, the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) approved the recommendations of the Committee on Zoning,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nThe positions zoned to the North-Central are: National Chairman, National Vice Chairman, Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nPositions zoned to the South-south are: National Vice Chairman, National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) a d National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nFor the South-west, the positions zoned to it are the National Secretary, National Vice Chairman, National Youth Leader, National Physically Challenged Leader, Deputy National Auditor, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nThe South-east positions are Deputy National Chairman (South), National Vice Chairman, National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nPositions zoned to the North-east are Deputy National Chairman (North), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (North East), Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Women Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nThose coming to the North-west are National Vice Chairman (North West), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, Deputy National, Youth Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex-Officio member, the post of National disabled leader is zoned to the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe party, however, said the zonal representatives of the CECPC would coordinate the process in each zone.\n\nMeanwhile, the CECPC has shifted its emergency NEC meeting from Tuesday to Thursday 17th March, 2022.\n\nThe notice of invitation for the meeting which would be held virtually was signed by nine out of the 12 members of the caretaker committee.\n\nThose that signed the notice were Bello, Senator Ken Nnamani \u2013 South East representative, Senator Abubakar Yusuf \u2013 Senate representative, Stella Okotete \u2013 Women leader and James Lalu \u2013 PWD representative.\n\nOthers were Chief David Lyon \u2013 South-South representative;

          "title": "First Time in 22 Years of Democracy, Senate Goes against Agreement Reached with Sitting President",
          "text": "\u2022 As lawmakers throw out Buhari\u2019s request to amend contentious clause 84 which abridges constitutional right of appointees to vote and be voted for\n\nSunday Aborisade\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1999, the Senate yesterday reneged on an agreement it reached with a sitting president as the lawmakers overwhelmingly threw out a bill seeking to amend the new Electoral Act 2022.\n\nAccording to analysts, that was the first time the National Assembly would reach an agreement with a sitting president and go against it.\n\nThe Executive request was made by President Muhammadu Buhari to amend the Electoral Act signed into law on February, 25 2022.\n\nBuhari had requested that the National Assembly should delete Section 84 (12) which mandates government appointees to resign their positions three months ahead of primary elections of political parties in the newly signed Electoral Act 2022\n\nOwing to the development on the Red Chamber yesterday, pundits argued that there might be distrust between the executive and the National Assembly going forward, adding that it could negatively impact future bills.\n\nThe analysts pointed out that right from the tenure of former presidents: Olusegun Obasanjo, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan \u2013 when the president wants to get a bill signed, they would agree with the National Assembly on areas they want removed or included and it would be done as agreed by both arms of government.\n\nTherefore, they noted that for the Senate not to abide with what was agreed with the executive would endanger future bills because the president would not listen to them again.\n\n\u201cBy their act, they have broken a sacrosanct tradition that is done everywhere in the world that practices democracy. This would have major impact on future bills and with future presidents,\u201d a source who pleaded to remain anonymous said.\n\nAnother source explained further; \u201cThe President had wanted to veto the reworked electoral act but was sensitive about the mood of the nation and the impact another delay would have on the 2023 elections calendar. Instead he raised the issue of the contentious clause with the leadership of the National Assembly who went to meet their caucus to discuss the President\u2019s concerns. They came back to the president that they have agreed to expunged the contentious clause that infringes on the constitutional rights of political appointees to vote or be voted for from the bill after he signed the bill into law. Having extracted that commitment from the leadership of the National Assembly, the President proceeded to sign the bill into law. And immediately followed with a request for an amendment based on the understanding reached with the lawmakers. It is therefore a betrayal of the understanding for the lawmakers to now turn round to reject the request from the President to amend the law to bring it in conformity with the constitution.\u201d\n\nReacting to the request by the president that Section 84 (12) be deleted in the new Electoral Act 2022, the source argued that, the section of the law was discriminatory because it allows elected officials to perpetuate themselves.\n\n\u201cThat means they would have no challenge from appointed officers,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was unanimously rejected by the lawmakers when it came for second reading on the floor during plenary, amidst a mild drama.\n\nThere were strong indications before plenary that the senators would kick against the bill despite the position of the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan that the red chamber would go ahead to consider the bill notwithstanding a court order barring it from doing so.\n\nThe court had, in a ruling delivered by Inyang Ekwo, on an ex-parte application by the People\u2019s Democratic Party, barred the President Muhammadu Buhari, the Attorney General of the Federation and the Senate President from tampering with the newly amended Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe Court maintained that the Electoral Act, having become a valid law could not be altered without following the due process of law.\n\nThe move to reject the bill was signaled by a point of order from Senator Adamu Aliero for it to be stepped down after the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, moved a motion for the bill to be read a second time.\n\nAliero, who came under a point of Order, drew the attention of his colleagues to the provision of Rule 52(5) of the Senate Standing Order.\n\nThe Order 52(5) provides that, \u201cReference shall not be made to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending, in such a way as might in the opinion of the President of the Senate prejudice the interest of parties thereto.\u201d\n\nAliero, therefore, advised the upper chamber to step down further consideration of the bill pending the vacation of a court order delivered by the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday.\n\nThe Senator maintained that going ahead with the amendment of the Act would be clear conflict with the sub judice rule in law which prevents the legislature from deliberating or considering any matter already before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nAliero explained: \u201cGoing ahead to consider the bill obviously will mean that we are disrespecting that order, and this is an institution of the Senate \u2013 the symbol of Nigeria\u2019s Lawmaking body.\n\n\u201cWe should not be seen to be disobeying the court order. No matter how bad that court order is, we should respect it.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m of the opinion that we should stop considering this bill pending the time the court set aside that order, and I think I\u2019m speaking the opinion of my colleagues here.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President, while ruling on Aliero\u2019s point of Order, insisted that the move by the upper chamber to amend the Electoral Act was in line with exercising its Constitutional duties amid following due process.\n\nLawan said: \u201cTo be specific to this particular request, for us in the Senate, it is to look at the request and follow our due process.\n\n\u201cLooking at the request does not mean granting the request. Members of the National Assembly are at liberty to review the request to see if the arguments by the Executive arm of government are convincing enough.\n\n\u201cIf the arguments are not convincing enough, the National Assembly can deny the request, and that is how it is. We have no encumbrance from that order.\n\n\u201cSo, it is for Senators here to decide to vote for this amendment or vote against it.\n\n\u201cI think we are not breaching any law, in fact, we are trying to promote democracy because to do otherwise may mean that one day someone will go to court and say that the Senate of the National Assembly should not sit.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to all of us, that we are on the right course and my ruling remains that we are going ahead to consider the proposal which the Leader of the Senate is leading the debate.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the debate, we are going to vote, and the vote will decide the fate of the bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure all of us know that whatever we do here is to protect democracy and the sanctity of the upper chamber,\u201d the Senate President said.\n\nThe Senate Leader, was then given the floor to lead the debate on the Electoral Act Amendment bill.\n\nThe real drama started unfolding when the Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe (Abia South), kicked against the deletion of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill as requested by President Buhari.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are certain things that we see which we think we don\u2019t even have to come here to debate.\n\n\u201cOne of those things is the fact that in every democracy, all over the world, there are certain rules which we don\u2019t need to be told about.\n\n\u201cOne of those rules is the fact that you cannot be a referee and a player on the same field. It is either you\u2019re a referee or a player.\n\n\u201cSo, every other place in the world where democracy is practiced including Nigeria, we don\u2019t need to be told that if we want to run for office, we have to resign. That is a sine qua non that we don\u2019t even need to debate.\n\n\u201cYet here we are today in Nigeria, and people think they can sit in an office and contest an election and become candidates and continue to sit in that office until the date of election. So, how would we continue to debase democracy in this way?\n\n\u201cMr. President, I think, a cursory look at this paper shows that this paper is dead on arrival. And I urge you, my colleagues, to help us to continue to deepen democracy by insisting that this bill not be read a second time in any manner whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe rejection of the bill continued with the bombshell from the APC Senator, representing Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi, who also, vehemently, expressed his disapproval to the consideration of the bill.\n\nAdeyemi said, \u201cone of the hallmarks of democracy is justice, fairness and equity.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIndeed, Mr. President, it is a settled matter in law that you cannot be a judge over you own case.\n\n\u201cIn any election, where people have the added advantage of holding executive power, either by proxy or directly or by appointment, for such people to have access and compete with others who came from the street, I think is an unjust society.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Mr. President, I disagree with all the arguments on the need to consider a decision that has already been settled.\u201d\n\nA last minute move by the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, to save the bill from sudden death by swaying his colleagues\u2019 standpoint, also suffered a devastating blow.\n\nOmo-Agege said, \u201cThe framers of the constitution, knew that a day like this will come. And notwithstanding, it clearly stipulated in the constitution those provisions with qualification and disqualification on running for political office.\n\n\u201cIf it was their intent that for holding a political office, you should not contest election, they would have so provided.\n\n\u201cThere were some provisions some of us voted for at the beginning of section 84(2) that says no political party shall seek to disqualify anybody by importing into the process a provision for qualification or disqualification not otherwise provided for in the constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen the bill was eventually put to a voice vote for second reading by the Senate President after its consideration, it received a resounding \u2018nay\u2019 from senators in the majority across party lines.\n\nThe Senate President made a futile attempt to save the bill when he put the question for a voice vote the second time and the senators maintained a resounding \u2018nay\u2019 again, leaving the presiding officer no other option than to hit the gavel in favour of the anti-bill lawmakers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Governor engages 18 senior advocates\n\n\u2022NBA condemns Umahi\u2019s attack on judge, demands apology\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja and Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to reverse a ruling by the Federal High Court, Abuja, which ordered their removal from office, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, yesterday engaged 18 Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN) to represent them in an appeal against the judgement. Umahi disclosed this during a solidarity rally held in Abakaliki, the state capital, by supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nBut the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it was awaiting the certified true copy of the court judgement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), yesterday, rose with indignation against Umahi for making unpleasant comments about a judge of the Federal High Court.\n\nUmahi said he had confidence in the judiciary, but he accused the legal team of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of misleading the judge of the Federal High Court, who ordered his removal from office.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cI want to thank Nigerians; I want to thank Ebonyi people. I am just here for two things: one is to urge you all to be very peaceful, another is to tell you that we still have very serious confidence in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe PDP lawyers were the people that did the hatchet job; the PDP were the people that were doing forum shopping and I am going to write the NBA to discipline them because you know, the judge was misled.\n\n\u201cIn Bayelsa governorship election, APC won the election but because there was defect in the credentials of the deputy, the Supreme Court, in their wisdom, saw that the votes cast in any election belongs to the candidates and not the party but lawyers knew about this but they misled the judge.\n\n\u201cI am using the opportunity to let Nigerians know that nobody castigated the judge and we will not do such.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have done three things: we have done the appeal at Enugu and when I said that we have two judgements, I said that the judgement in Ebonyi State, which has equal powers with that of Abuja, will be obeyed.\n\n\u201cWe will appeal the judgement of Abuja High court; we did not say we will disobey the court, otherwise, we will not appeal the judgement.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of South East Governors\u2019 Forum said the appeal was already before the appeal court in Enugu. \u201cWe are also before the appeal court in Abuja and we have also filed stay of execution,\u201d he added.\n\nUmahi noted that with the appeal already filled, he still remained the governor while Igwe remained the deputy governor of the state.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I made it very clear that the Supreme Court has said that for any defection in the legislative houses, the presiding officer, who is the Speaker or the Senate President, has the duty and not the court to declare the seat vacant,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated further that the House of Assembly had also appealed against the judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja, adding that the Assembly is still intact.\n\nUmahi told the people, \u201cThere is nothing to be afraid of, go about your businesses very peacefully and let me assure the NBA chairman that he is a perfect gentleman and that we will never insult the judiciary.\n\n\u201cWe have confidence in the judiciary and I know they will do the right thing and we have engaged eight SANs to proceed to Abuja, we have also engaged 10 SANs to proceed to Enugu. Do not be angry about anything, it is for our promotion.\n\n\u201cWhat the people intended for evil, God has turned it for good. When it happened yesterday, God told me be still and know that I am God. And so, you will see what God is going to do, Nigerians are fighting for us.\u201d\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had on Tuesday ordered Umahi, his deputy, and 16 state lawmakers to vacate their offices on account of their defection from PDP to APC. Ekwo held that their continued stay in office after defecting was illegal, null and void because the votes, which brought them into office, belonged to PDP that they had dumped for APC.\n\nHowever, in the notice of appeal filed by their lead lawyer, Chukwuma Machukwu-Ume, Umahi and Igwe asked the court to allow their appeal and set aside the judgment of the trial court that ordered their sack.\n\nThe appellants predicated the appeal on 11 grounds on which they argued that the trial court erred in law in arriving at the decision to remove them from office.\n\nIn ground one of the appeal, the appellants contended that the lower court erred in law and misdirected itself when it held that they \u201chave not seen any authority which propounds that where a governor or deputy governor defects, his political party on which platform he was elected into office, he cannot be sued by that political party to reclaim its mandate\u2026Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution did not envisage such a situation.\u201d\n\nThe appellants submitted that the trial court was virtually setting aside the Supreme Court of Nigeria\u2019s decision in \u201cAG Federation v. Atiku Abubakar & 3 ORS (2007) LCN/3799(SC) to the effect that there is no constitutional provisions prohibiting the president or vice and invariably the governor and or deputy governor from defecting to another political party or meting out punishment for doing same.\n\n\u201cThe trial court was also virtually setting aside the decision of the Supreme Court in Global Excellence Communications Ltd v. Duke (2007) LPELR \u2014 1323 to the effect that state governors and their deputies have immunity against being sued while in office.\u201d\n\nUmahi and Igwe argued that the provisions of Section 308 were specific, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the constitution, but subject to Subsection (2) of the section that \u201cno civil or criminal proceedings shall be instituted or continued against 3th and 4th appellants during their mandate in office as governor and deputy governor respectively.\u201d\n\nMore so, the appellants maintained, \u201cThere is no provision of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) that provides for the removal of the appellants as sitting governor and deputy governor, respectively, of Ebonyi State for reason of defection.\u201d\n\nAmong other grounds, the appellants argued that the lower court erred in law when it assumed jurisdiction on the issue of defection of appellants, when it had no jurisdiction over it.\n\nThe error, according to Umahi and Igwe, was that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of what amounted to the Federal High Court having the powers of State High Court under the constitution was wrong.\n\n\u201cPower of court and jurisdiction are not the same,\u201d the appellants argued.\n\nThe appellants argued that they were state officers and not federal officers. They faulted Ekwo for relying on Sections 68 and 109 of the 1999 Constitution in holding that the appellants, having defected from PDP to APC, offended the provisions of the constitution and must vacate their offices as governor and deputy governor.\n\nThey further claimed that the trial court misdirected itself because, \u201cThere is no specific mention of governor and deputy governor in the provisions of Section 68 and 109, respectively, of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cBy relying on Sections 68 and 109 of the constitution, the trial court assumed the role of the legislator and arrogated to itself the powers of amendment of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThere is no provision in the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which state that governor or deputy governor will vacate his office if he defects from his political party to another political party.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the 16 lawmakers of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly prayed the appellate court to set aside Ekwo\u2019s judgement of March 8, which also asked them to vacate their seats.\n\nThe affected lawmakers, in their notice of appeal dated March 9, also sought an order of the Court of Appeal setting aside the judgement of Ekwo.\n\nRespondents in the appeal are PDP, INEC, and APC.\n\nWe Are Waiting for Certified True Copy of Judgement, Says INEC\n\nINEC yesterday said it was yet to be served the certified true copy of the court ruling sacking Umahi and the others. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr. Festus Okoye, disclosed this in an interview with newsmen in Abuja.\n\nOkoye said the commission would meet and take a decision when it receives the certified true copy of the court judgement.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe commission has not been served with a copy of the said judgement. The commission will meet and take a decision when it is served with a Certified True Copy of the judgement.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekalmi, said, \u201cAt the close of work yesterday, Tuesday 8th March, the commission had not received the Certified True Copy of the judgement of the Federal High Court on the matter.\n\n\u201cIt is only when this happens that the commission will meet and take a decision.\u201d\n\nIn reaction to the court judgement, PDP said it had submitted to INEC the names of Iduma Igariwey, a serving member of the House of Representatives, as nominee to replace Umahi, and Fred Udogwu as deputy governor to replace Igwe.\n\nPDP National Chairman, Sen. Iyorchia Ayu, said at a press conference in Abuja that the decision was made after due consultation with party stakeholders at the national and Ebonyi State chapter, in compliance with the Tuesday\u2019s judgement of the Federal High Court.\n\nNBA Condemns Umahi\u2019s Attack on Judge, Demands Apology\n\nNBA yesterday rose with indignation against Umahi for making unsavoury comments against a judge of the Federal High Court.\n\nIn his immediate reaction to the judgement, Umahi had in a press briefing attacked the person and judgement of Justice Ekwo, an action NBA said was not only unwarranted but a display of impunity.\n\nThe umbrella association of Nigerian lawyers said in a statement, \u201cThe NBA has noted with utter dismay, the unfortunate and totally unacceptable reaction of Engr. Dave Umahi to the judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja, delivered on March 8, 2022, by Justice Inyang Ekwo, which inter-alia ordered him and Mr. Eric Igwe to vacate the offices of governor and deputy governor, respectively, of Ebonyi State on grounds of their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cFollowing the judgement, Engr. Umahi, in the course of a press conference \u2013 video evidence of which is currently making the rounds on both new and mainstream media \u2013 threw caution to the wind and deployed very uncomplimentary adjectives and intemperate language in characterising both the judgment and Justice Ekwo, including but not limited to describing the judgment as jungle justice and His Lordship as a hatchet man.\n\n\u201cAs if these were not enough, Engr. Umahi accused the court of murdering justice and also arrogated to himself the judicial powers and magisterial authority to declare the judgement of a court of competent jurisdiction as null and void while unashamedly declaring his intention to disregard the judgement in favour of another.\n\n\u201cTo put it plainly, this is impunity of the highest order and executive rascality taken too far.\u201d\n\nPresident of NBA, Mr. Olumide Akpata, who signed the statement, noted that although NBA had absolutely no interest in the outcome of the case in question and would continue to stay away from partisan politics, it would not \u201csit idly by in the face of this unprovoked and totally unwarranted attack on the judiciary.\u201d\n\nAkpata disclosed that the leadership of NBA had been inundated with calls from a cross-section of well-meaning Nigerians who were outraged by the utterances of Umahi and who had rightly demanded that appropriate action be taken to protect the sanctity of the judiciary.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is for this reason that we condemn without equivocation, Engr. Umahi\u2019s unfortunate diatribe which, if it had emanated from an average litigant, would still have been regarded as shocking but coming from one who occupies the exalted office of a state governor, is nothing short of a national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the judgement, one would have expected Engr. Umahi to sue for calm from his supporters and to assure them that all legal and constitutional avenues would be explored to challenge the judgement.\n\n\u201cFor Umahi to, instead, resort to attacking and denigrating the high office of a judge in this unprecedented manner is disgraceful, undemocratic, and completely unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe view Engr. Umahi\u2019s reaction to this judgement as being consistent with the current penchant, on the part of those in the executive arm of government, for intimidating the judiciary whilst taking advantage of the historical reluctance of that arm of government to rise to its own defence.\n\n\u201cIn light of the forgoing, the NBA hereby demands an immediate apology from Dave Umahi and a retraction of the comments he made against the person and judgement of Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court. It is also our demand that this apology and retraction is given as much media coverage as the press conference where the unfortunate comments were made.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Residents of Damasak town in the Mobbar Local Government Area of Borno State are currently living in fear after the Brigade Commander for the 145 battalion withdrew troops from the area, a military source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\nSome military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Brig. Gen. G.O. Olorunyomi was dispatched to the area to replace S.S. Tilawan as the new Brigade Commander but noted it had affected the security of the area.\n\nFile Photo\n\nThe sources alleged that G.O. Olorunyomi was only after his convenience having withdrawn troops and other weapons from Damasak to Gubio which was termed \u2018Tactical Headquarters\u2019.\n\n\n\nOne of the sources said the new Brigade Commander, from all indications, does not want to stay in the bush (Damasak) and would rather serve himself than the people, who are now in danger.\n\n\n\nThe source told SaharaReporters, \u201cThere is serious tension in Damasak as the new brigade commander, Brig.

          "title": "How Helium Health assembled a star founding team",
          "text": "Finding co-founders and hiring employees in the early days of a startup is integral to its survival and growth. Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, navigated this challenge in its early days by putting together a team of first employees that got the job done.\n\nHelium Health was co-founded by Adegoke Olubisi, Dimeji Sofowora, and Tito Ovia in 2016 to use technology to provide better healthcare services for Africans. Today, it optimises medical records by storing them electronically; and provides a payment system and healthcare financing solution for clinics, and a telemedicine feature. In 2020, Helium Health raised $10 million in Series A funding to expand its offering across African countries. Last November, it expanded to the MENA region when it acquired a Qatar-headquartered and UAE-based doctor booking platform, Meddy.\n\nTo understand the role having a star team plays in a startup\u2019s early days, Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, spoke with Tito Ovia, co\u2013founder and current Head of Public Sector Growth at Helium Health, on the fifth episode of Building From Ground Up, Season 2, by the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.\n\nOvia was named a Forbes 30 under 30 recipient and a winner of the Future Africa Award for Disruption for her work on African healthcare through Helium Health. When Ovia is not fixing healthcare in Africa, she is occupied with the Feminist Coalition, a globally-acclaimed women\u2019s rights advocacy group promoting equality for women in the Nigerian society with a core focus on education, financial freedom, and representation in public office.\n\nFinding co-founders\n\nOvia\u2019s childhood dream was to provide healthcare services across Africa, but that dream did not materialise until she quit her job at the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency. Ovia, at the time, was trying to figure out what to do next in the healthcare space. She also wanted to leave the country. A friend of hers, who attended law school with her co-founder, Demiji, told her about a small group of people trying to build a tech and healthcare company, but none of the co-founders were in the healthcare space. The friend advised Ovia to have a talk with them because they needed directions and would need the help of someone like her.\n\nSo, Ovia met with Goke and Dimeji for the first time for a chat intended to last an hour but stretched to 7 hours. During the conversation, it was clear that they were all connected by a similar drive and interest. \u201cWe connected on a deeper level of wanting to be able to provide value and fix our country,\u201d Ovia said.\n\nConvincing your first set of customers\n\nOvia said that it was challenging to convince people, that they knew what they were doing. When they tried to get their first 10\u201315 customers, they were required to present other people that could vouch for them.\n\nOvia said that another challenge Helium Health faced in its early days was identifying the strength of each of its team members and only assigning related tasks to them. \u201cIf you are a small team of 5, everybody does everything. It was a scramble, and all hands were on deck to get things done.\u201d\n\nWhen Ovia was asked about how she managed conflict and managing relationships with her co-founders, she explained that she likes good conflict and doesn\u2019t see it as a horrible thing because it means that \u201cnobody is a sheep\u2014it means everybody is thinking and invested in the growth of the organisation\u201d. \u201d\n\nShe sees conflict as a pitch: \u201cIf you can\u2019t convince co-founders on a particular direction, how do you want to convince the outside world, your investors, and board?\u201d\n\nOvia also noted that she and her co-founders take management and leadership courses and have mediators who step in during their conflicts. She also revealed they have advisors and neutral parties who are invested in the growth of the company and provide their opinions on important issues.\n\nWhat makes good co-founders?\n\nOvia believes trust is one of the things that makes a good co-founder. \u201cI have to be able to close my eyes and believe that you are not going to throw me off a cliff.\u201d This should be coupled with openness, she noted.\n\nOvia believes it is important that co-founders be at the right place in their lives. \u201cWhat this means is that, if you decide to be a high growth startup, everybody must have the time and bandwidth to build it,\u201d she said. This is because she explained, personal responsibilities might stop some people from committing to such gruelling work. \u201cSometimes, you have a co-founder slacking because they have other priorities in their life.\u201d\n\nShe also believes co-founders must have similar values. \u201cEverybody has to be able to align on how and where they want to end up.\u201d Ovia doesn\u2019t believe there is an ideal number of co-founders but also does not believe in gathering people just for the sake of it.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t believe that every entrepreneur needs a co-founder. Although, she believes every founder needs a strong executive team: a chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), and chief technical officer (CTO) \u201cThis is because, if anything goes wrong, the strong executive team that you\u2019ve built can do the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nThis is important, she explains because building in a startup\u2019s early days is a lonely process. \u201cThere are so many trials and tribulations that we\u2019ve gone through at Helium Health that I\u2019m so grateful I\u2019ve had co-founders to cry to when it feels like everything is over.\u201d\n\nOvia recalled that in Helium Health\u2019s early days, they couldn\u2019t even afford to schedule a meeting with the kind of talent that they have now. \u201cThen, it was just an idea, a couple of hospitals, and we were not sure if we would make it past the year.\u201d So, Helium Health had to forgo talent and opt for talent that were fresh out of the university and had a few years\u2019 of experience.\n\n\u201cWe targeted dreamers, people who are committed to the idea and who believe that someday the startup would be big. We sold the promise of a tomorrow to our early staff. Some people didn\u2019t buy it, some people did.\u201d\n\nBut as they grew, post-Series A, they needed people with more advanced skills\u2014chief product officer (CPO), head of HR, head of finance, and CFO\u2014so, they started selling good working conditions: early closing time, working from home, and employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to their employees. \u201cBy doing that, we were able to attract the sort of amazing talent we have now.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ovia didn\u2019t find looking for a technical co-founder difficult because Helium Health\u2019s CEO was a technical person, she advised them to get an executive or senior manager on board instead of a technical co-founder. \u201cWhen you see that there is a working relationship between you and the person, you can then bring them on board as a co-founder.\u201d She advised against rushing into a co-founder relationship because it is like a marriage.\n\nWatch the full conversation here:\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Why e-commerce is king in Egypt",
          "text": "When Syrian entrepreneur Ronaldo Mouchawar founded Souq.com in 2005, buying things by clicking a picture on a clunky computer was unheard of in the Middle East. Somehow, Souq managed to quickly become the leading online retailer in the Middle East. And in 2017, twelve years after it launched, Amazon bought it for $580 million to expand operations in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nToday Egyptian sales make up more than half of Souq\u2019s revenues.\n\nSouq\u2019s $580 million buyout underscored Amazon\u2019s online retail expectations in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where e-commerce continues to grow at 25% every year. Bain and Company say the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Egypt, with its 103+ million residents, make up roughly 80% of the e-commerce market in the MENA region.\n\nFurthermore, a Disrupt Africa report released in January shows that 20% of Egyptian startups are decidedly pursuing opportunities in the e-commerce and retail-tech space. That is roughly two times the number of fintech startups operating in the country and a sharp contrast to the rest of the continent\u2019s startup profile. Last year, Egyptian e-commerce startups received USD$ 131.27 million; according to Africa: The Big Deal, which is 1.4 times the e-commerce funding Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa received in the same period.\n\nClearly, retail tech and e-commerce rule Egypt\u2019s tech scene; and this is why.\n\nGovernment policy is pushing informal SME retail online.\n\nFacing a budget deficit of $27.8 billion in May 2018, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi offered five-year tax exemptions while urging informal workers to legalise their status. The government had hoped to raise an additional $51.9 billion in taxes from the informal sector. At a parliamentary session, Mohamed Badrawi, a member of the Economic Affairs Committee, declared that \u201cIncorporating all these economic activities into the formal sector is becoming an urgent matter.\u201d\n\nThe informal sector in Egypt accounts for more than half of Egypt\u2019s economy. In 2020, the government issued a new law that offered incentives for small businesses to incorporate as formal entities. Beyond creating incentives for informal traders to formalise operations, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank imposed daily limits on cash deposits and withdrawals while asking banks to remove similar daily limits on digital transactions. The bank says this will help support financial inclusion goals. In reality, however, this push saw informal traders who generate bulk sales in cash struggle to deposit and withdraw cash, as a result, pushing them to formalise their businesses. When these traders incorporate and begin to accept digital transactions, it also makes sense to take their business online.\n\nA market scene in Cairo. Egypt\u2019s informal economy constitutes up to 50% of the country\u2019s GDP, provides more than 60% of new jobs and is growing by 1% every year.\n\nPhoto: Alex Azabache/Unsplash\n\nThe functioning belief on the part of the government was that e-commerce would aid a transition away from cash dependency, which will, in turn, reduce the size of the informal sector and increase tax revenue.\n\nCovid-related restrictions accelerated consumer trust in digital commerce channels.\n\nThe social and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation globally. Egypt was not an exception.\n\nDespite the government\u2019s best-strong-armed efforts (it mandated the use of cashless systems to pay for government services and imposed fines on defaulters), Egyptian shoppers remained reluctant to use digital channels for shopping or payments \u2013 until the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThis was also partly driven by the reforms mentioned earlier which the Egyptian government used to encourage informal retailers to formalise their operations. At the time, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank waived several bank transaction fees for 6 months which it later extended to the middle of 2021. As a result, despite predictions about slowing digital commerce growth in Egypt, Jumia and Noon reported a 940% increase in online sales as the pandemic hit. 72% of participants in a Mastercard survey claimed to have shopped online during the pandemic.\n\nThe trend appears to have sustained beyond COVID-19 as more people than ever use smartphones to access services. Today Egyptian e-commerce is expected to grow at least 30% this year, buoyed by younger shoppers and rising incomes from Egypt\u2019s expanding middle class.\n\nGood infrastructure is good business.\n\nAn omnibus whizzes past in Alexandria, Egypt. 74% of Egypt\u2019s 65,050km road network are paved more than double the continental average.\n\nPhoto: Fady Fouad/Unsplash\n\nAs e-commerce accelerated in Egypt, it created a ripple effect on the logistics sector. People who buy things online need to get their goods delivered somehow. While infrastructure in Egypt is not the best globally, Egyptian infrastructure is second only to that of the island nation of Seychelles on the Africa Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nA combination of a reasonably good road network and increased investment in transport and telecoms infrastructure is proving beneficial to the handful of logistics-tech startups that are helping to make shopping online easier.\n\nStill, as with online retail anywhere, last-mile logistics remains an issue. According to Waya Media, 40% of online orders in Egypt do not reach their customers the first time they are shipped. So while Egypt\u2019s 4000 post offices make up the backbone of its distribution network, a good number of online retailers who need to deliver items to their customers\u2019 doorsteps partner with full-service logistics companies or use smaller specialized delivery units that stitch together end-to-end services to patch delivery gaps.\n\nAggressive infrastructure investments by the Egyptian government has seen it rise to second place, only behind Seychelles on the African Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nSource: Open Data for Africa\n\nOther startups like Appetito are pioneering franchised pickup centres similar to what Getir does in Europe to bring grocery deliveries closer to their customers. More prominent players like Amazon opened a 28,000 square meter warehouse in the 10th of Ramadan City in August last year. The new hub and 15 delivery stations across Cairo, Alexandria, Tanta, Ismailia, and Assiut are part of Amazon\u2019s growing MENA distribution network.\n\nEgypt\u2019s last-mile delivery startups are the API connectors in a very fragmented supply chain. Image source: Wamda.\n\n\u201c[BNPL will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards\u201d \u2013 Sherif Nessim, Founding General Partner, Jedar Capital\n\nThe e-commerce boom is also creating ripple effects for fintech in Egypt. While cash-on-delivery is very much alive, the value of card transactions is growing at an impressive pace. The Egyptian central bank is playing a leading role in facilitating this shift. For example, it allows banks operating in the Egyptian market to own unlimited shares in payment service providers and payment systems operators as part of the country\u2019s push towards cashless payments.\n\nSherif Nessim, Founding General Partner at Jedar Capital, believes that Buy Now Pay Later offerings can help accelerate the transition to digital payments. \u201cEvery year, we find that the balance is moving from cash-on-delivery to cards, cash to cards. People are putting more trust in online payment methods,\u201d BNPL solutions, he adds, \u201c[will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards because if I pay with this credit card, I can pay in 6 months, interest-free.\u201d When you think about it, it makes sense for a market where younger and relatively more impulsive shoppers are the drivers of e-commerce growth.\n\nAccording to Nessim, all of these plays are part of why he expects growth to continue for traditional e-commerce and q-commerce companies.\n\nAttractive growth prospects lure VC money.\n\n2021 was a record-setting year for venture-backed companies globally. Venture capitalists invested more than USD$ 675 billion into startups globally, and Africa outdid its 2019 record with more than $5 billion invested in African startups. Venture funds were themselves swamped with cash, partly a fall out of fiscal (stimulus) policies for the pandemic and partly as a result of more people being willing to bet on risky \u201ccompanies of the future\u201d than ever before.\n\nAll of this activity has set the perfect stage for venture capital funds in Egypt. Last year and led by funding into e-commerce and retail tech companies, Egyptian startups raised $403.5 million, according to data from Disrupt Africa.\n\nWith more cash to spend, investor packs are hunting for growth and returns in emerging and frontier markets. Post-revolution Egypt happens to be one of the latest such frontier markets. Naturally, investors have their eyes on it. \u201cThey realise that the next ten years are the years for emerging and frontier markets,\u201d Sherif Nessim says. He adds that some VC firms he knows are creating dedicated funds \u201cthat only invest in emerging markets rather than invest out of their global funds.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, like Amazon and Souq illustrate, bigger growth-hungry companies in the United States and Europe prefer to acquire local companies in emerging markets instead of building from scratch.\n\nEgypt\u2019s unique combination of growing venture capital interest, growth prospects, and a government determined to shore up revenues by including more informal businesses means digital commerce will continue to grow as more retailers become formal and come online. At the same time, it also signals significant growth prospects for affordable business-to-business software and services to help these newly formal businesses manage their processes and access credit.\n\nCritics have slammed MENA investors for mostly backing e-commerce and marketplace startups. However, by helping buying and selling thrive online, those investments may be responsible for accelerating digital adoption in other areas in a region as conservative as the MENA. After all, since commerce is the backbone of the world\u2019s economic systems, it only makes sense for the digital version of the bazaars and souks that line Egyptian streets to lead the way for her technology ecosystem.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Fintech innovations on the rise in DR Congo\u2019s nascent startup landscape",
          "text": "As with most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, access to basic financial services is significantly limited in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Just 14% of the population have an actual bank account and only 25% have an account with either banking or any other financial institution.\n\nMore so, there is less than 35 kilometre of paved road for every 1 million inhabitants in the French-speaking country, making traditional branch-based banking unfeasible for most of its 90 million residents and the bid for financial inclusion arduous.\n\nThe digital finance revolution that\u2019s played out in the rest of Africa over the past decade thus cannot come soon enough for people in the central African nation, especially given it has a 47% mobile phone penetration rate, with the figure likely to grow further.\n\nA number of startups have sprung up over the past 5 years, which, through fintech innovations, have brought financial services closer to where people live and work. One such is Flash International, the largest fintech and payments aggregator in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlash operates a network of agents that allows people to do their banking on its mobile platform (FlashApp), putting financial services\u2014including remittance, payments, and other value-added services\u2014within easy reach.\n\nThe startup currently has roughly 3,500 agents and 90 branches, through which it serves more than 2 million customers. And instead of opening individual accounts with multiple banks or mobile money operators, Flash gives its users a card with which they can accept all payments.\n\nChief executive Jonathan Johannesen, whose 25 years of professional experience cuts across roles in financial institutions like Citi and mobile finance firms Moneytrans and TigoCash, started the company in 2018.\n\nSince its launch, Flash has recorded stellar growth and is currently integrated with several banks, mobile money, and telecom operators. It claims to process nearly 1 million transactions valued at over $50 million per month through its payment services and also facilitates more than 40,000 satellite TV subscription transactions, one of its value-added products.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the mission was to build the first Congolese fintech that would aggregate as many financial and value-added services as possible. \u201cWhat we currently have is an application with up to 27 different products and services, through which thousands of agents make a living out of,\u201d Johannesen recalled in a recent interview with TechCabal.\n\nA screenshot of the Flash web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nUnlike Flash, Okapi Finance was launched out of Sweden by founder Gis\u00e8le Mwepu, with DRC being one of the company\u2019s four markets across all the regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The startup rolled out its services in the country last year and currently has 170,000 customers. Its goal, according to Mwepu, is to reach up to 25 million people in the country in less than 10 years.\n\n\u201cDRC has over 90 million people and still there aren\u2019t many financial services solutions available. The opportunity is very huge. And the unbanked people aren\u2019t just individuals, they can be traders, merchants, or informal employees,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Okapi platform allows both individual and enterprise customers carry out daily financial transactions like deposits, money transfers, and salary disbursements through its web and mobile platforms, USSD, and physical agents.\n\nOkapi has a special focus on getting more women included in the country\u2019s financial services ecosystem. Per Mwepu, up to 80% of the company\u2019s DRC users and 95% of the 17,000 merchants it\u2019s onboarded are women. For the latter, the company extends a line of credit\u2014weekly loans of around $50\u2014to help power their businesses.\n\n\u201cFinancial inclusion cannot be achieved by only allowing people to carry out payment transactions,\u201d Mwepu noted. \u201cWe need to increase their accessibility to a wide array of financial services.\u201d\n\nThrough the Okapi platform, microfinance banks and insurance providers can distribute their products, enabling them penetrate the informal sector and reach the unbanked population. In addition, users don\u2019t need a bank account to access these services and after signing up can apply for the Okapi Visa card.\n\nA screenshot of the Okapi Finance web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nWhereas Flash focuses on urban areas like Kinshasa with most of its agents in DRC\u2019s major cities, Faysal Axam\u2019s startup targets the unbanked population in rural areas, where more than half of the population resides.\n\nIn Goma, the capital and business hub of North Kivu province in the eastern DRC, Faysal Company offers a \u201cTap and Pay\u201d solution\u2014a magnetic card that interacts with POS machines and interfaces with a virtual wallet.\n\n\u201cFinancial flows are mostly in DRC\u2019s urban areas, not so much in peri-urban areas, and nearly not at all in rural areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile mobile money penetration rate is 72% in cities, it\u2019s only 28% in rural areas.\u201d\n\nCircumventing fintech challenges in DRC\n\nIn a country like DRC where road and internet infrastructure is below par, agents are especially effective at reaching rural dwellers and reducing deployment costs for providers.\n\nFor customers, agent networks reduce travelling time and security risks as they historically had to locate one of the only 500 bank branches available in the country\u2014which is ironically Africa\u2019s second-largest country by land area and the fourth most populous.\n\n\u201cMost transactions are done over the counter in DRC as there\u2019s still a very low penetration in terms of smartphones and internet access is not affordable. Also, the prevalent habit of the population is mainly to visit an agent for a transaction or service,\u201d Johannesen said.\n\nA high capital barrier for entry in the financial services space preserves the dominance of big banks like Ecobank and UBA as well as network operators (such as Vodacom Congo, Orange RDC, and Bharti Airtel who collectively control 35-40 million subscribers).\n\nFintech startups looking to partner with banks and telcos have had to deal with skepticism and aversion from the industry giants. Axam recalled it took Faysal almost a year and a half to get its first mobile money integration license in 2020 after the startup was rebuffed by banks and local mobile network operators for partnerships.\n\nA screenshot of the Faysal Company web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nMultipay Congo, DRC\u2019s first inter-banking platform, was launched in 2015 to create interoperability between payment platforms like ATMs and point of sale machines.\n\nBut the framework doesn\u2019t make integrating with banks and telcos any easier for fintechs, according to Mwepu. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to achieve financial inclusion without interoperability of solutions from other stakeholders like banks and telcos. We have to work together,\u201d the Okapi Finance founder said.\n\nOn the back of a successful partnership with Orange, Faysal\u2019s customer base has exceeded 10,000. Although that\u2019s a small number, it\u2019s significant nonetheless in a country where more than 70% of the population live on less than $1.90 a day and most have no immediate incentives to open financial accounts.\n\nAxam added that Faysal\u2019s growth is also because the solution can be used offline, even in areas without internet connectivity.\n\nWith internet access at around 17%, feature phones \u2013 which retail at about $20 \u2013 play a huge role in enabling Congolese to access digital finance services. Faysal, for instance, gets most of its traction from the USSD feature as Goma dwellers often must seek a mountaintop just to access 2G cell phone coverage.\n\nIn addition, while banks and telcos boast sufficient financial muscle to build and scale their products, startups lack access to sufficient finance. \u201cWe don\u2019t have finance, investors, incubators, and accelerators, especially in Goma,\u201d Axam said, citing security issues as a challenge that makes it hard for investors to trust the ecosystem. \u201cMany excellent solutions here can\u2019t get continental or international exposure because of this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important, however, to note that the DRC\u2019s fintech landscape is practically nascent with only 12 startups playing in the space as of 2018, per a report from Microsave and MasterCard. But the digital finance seeds are clearly beginning to take root and there are concrete reasons to be bullish about the opportunities in DRC for fintech and its prospect to attract investors.\n\nWith startups like Flash, Okapi, Faysal, alongside remittance fintechs, partnerships like the Mastercard and Billetera deal targeting the millions of financially excluded residents, as well as the government\u2019s increasing shift towards virtual payments for its over thousands of civil servants, one can anticipate a radical digital finance expansion in the coming years as DRC moves to replicate other African countries\u2019 successes, slowly but surely.\n\n\u201cFintechs in DRC are beginning to thrive. It\u2019s definitely promising but a better infrastructural coverage is crucial to realising full potential,\u201d said Noel K. Tshiani founder of Congo Business Network, an international network of Congolese professionals and entrepreneurs. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the vision of the DRC government under President Felix Tshisekedi and its ambitious digitisation program aligned with the country\u2019s National Digital Plan.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Nkiru Amadi-Emina and Ijeoma Akwiwu met at a birthday party in Abuja, Nigeria, they knew they\u2019d make good friends; what they didn\u2019t know was, they would make good co-founders as well. But 8 years into their friendship, they have built and run a couple of projects and businesses together and, now, they are focused on building Pivo, a startup they envision will be the neobank for trade in Africa. Like AfreximBank but faster and digitally operated.\n\nThe big picture is to be the go-to neobank for trade in Africa by the end of this year, or next.\n\nPivo entered the market with Pivo Capital, a credit-focused financial services platform for supply chain small and medium businesses (SMEs), because of the co-founders\u2019 track record in the supply chain industry, especially the logistics aspect.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLong before Pivo, Amadi-Emina, a software engineer, worked as a tech consultant for Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for over 2 years. She left INEC in 2017 to found her first startup Jalo, a venture-backed on-demand delivery company that focused on Nigeria\u2019s North-Central market and served e-commerce platforms like Jumia and Konga in that region.\n\nIn August 2018, Amadi-Emina joined Kobo360 after the logistic startup acquired Jalo in an acquihire deal. She remained at Kobo360 for a little over 3 years before leaving last year to focus on Pivo.\n\nFor Akwiwu, a trained lawyer who claimed to have stumbled on tech by chance and the influence of friends like Amadi-Emina, her law career, which started officially in 2013, spanned across law firms and companies like Gilmor Engineering, one of the biggest engineering firms in Nigeria, where she worked for over 6 years.\n\nBut, along the line, she started playing with project and product management and operations, monitoring projects, and product development lifecycles on the side. Last year, she decided to transition fully into tech. She left law to focus on building Pivo and getting a master\u2019s degree in software development while at it.\n\nWith Amadi-Emina\u2019s experience in the logistics side of the supply chain, having worked and led the port operation effort at Kobo360, Akwiwu\u2019s experience in law, and their collective knowledge of running an exportation business, building a business that serves the logistics arm of the supply chain was a no-brainer.\n\nLogistics supply chain is Pivo\u2019s first stop\n\nIn Africa, access to credit is still one of the biggest challenges small businesses deal with, especially small supply chain businesses. Supply chain businesses usually have a short time to execute a contract, and due to the excessive bureaucracy and numerous requirements, acquiring credit from traditional financial institutions takes a long time, therefore these businesses are automatically at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is where Pivo comes in.\n\nA truck loading at the port.

Pivo is like a third-party partner in a transaction between a buyer and a seller. But to understand what Pivo does, one must first understand how supply chain financing works.\n\nSupply chain finance is a type of cash advance suppliers receive from lenders to fulfill a transaction or contract before the buyer pays them.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: a merchant wants to supply a buyer with goods but needs some working capital to see the transaction through before the buyer pays them. So the merchant approaches the lender (that would be Pivo, in this case) for a credit. The lender then collects all required information to check for the legitimacy of their transaction or contract claim with the buyer, then disburses the credit once the buyer confirms the contract.\n\nThe above illustration explains Pivo at its core. Once a business finishes their KYC and asks for credit, Pivo prompts them to supply all the information about the transaction they need financing for. After that, Pivo profiles the business seeking credit for worthiness, runs a risk assessment on the transaction, and then profiles the businesses they are doing the transaction with, to ascertain whether they are credible and good for the money.\n\nOnce everything checks out and the buyer agrees to pay into the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, Pivo then disburses the loan. In partnership with Providus Bank, Pivo provides its customers with a business account that facilitates remittance. So, after the money lands in the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, the startup takes its dues.\n\nAll these checks and assessments help Pivo to finance only creditworthy customers and less-risky transactions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to ensure 98% recovery on every single capital we deploy to our customers,\u201d Amadi-Emina told TechCabal.\n\nAmadi-Emina also mentioned that the average capital requests they\u2019ve received per customer is about $10,000. And while they cater for credits within the range of $5,000 from the company\u2019s balance sheet, requests above $5,000 are passed to their credit partners.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nFor now, the startup is still building in a stealth mode and according to the CEO Amadi-Emina, Pivo currently has about 250 direct SMEs customers and 5 ecosystem leads, which are the larger corporations that Pivo serve the SMEs within their value chain through embedded finance. Each ecosystem lead is reported to have about 500 to 1,000 SMEs.\n\nThe startup lists some of the top logistic companies in Africa as its ecosystem lead customers including Jetstream Africa, SabiRoad, Vee Logistics, and MVx.\n\nOn the side of its loan book, the co-founders said they have disbursed $1 million worth of credit out of over $2 million worth of applications that they have received since launch.\n\nThe company makes money from the interest charged on the credit disbursed, management fees, and the one-off charges from account creation. Akwiwu believes that as they continue to add more offerings, they will have more sources of revenue.\n\nThe startup has also raised a 6-figure preseed from Microtraction, FirstCheck Africa, Ventures Platform, Mercy Corps Venture, Rally Cap Ventures, Metis Capital Partner, Bold Angel Fund, and recently just got into the ODX accelerator programme where it\u2019s entitled to $125,000 for a 7% equity stake.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFor Akwiwu and Amadi-Emma, the roadmap is clear and they already have new products that will help them become a full-fledged neobank for trade in the works. For example, products like Invoice Factoring and Pivo Plus, which includes insurance and corporate compliance offerings, are already in the testing phase.\n\nThe company is currently only operational in Nigeria with the plan to expand into Ghana before the end of the year.\n\nThe competition in the credit market in Africa is heating up and it\u2019s good for SMEs. While there are new upstarts springing up to provide credit for businesses, the bigger ones are also making a fray into the scene. For instance, Flutterwave, the unicorn fintech, has joined the credit space with the recent announcement of Flutterwave Capital.\n\nWhile other startups like Payhippo, Lendigo, Float, and even Brass have successfully built a digital financial institution that provides credit for African SMEs, Pivo is the only one playing strictly in the supply chain sector, at least that we know of at the moment.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The total worth of disbursed credit has been changed from $980,000 to $1 million. Between the time we interviewed the founders and the date this article was published, Pivo disbursed another $20,000 in credit.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB)\n\nThe statement was signed by Uwa Suleiman, Media Aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, the NDPB was established in line with global best practices and would focus on data protection and privacy for the country.\n\nAmong other things, the statement credits the introduction of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) with creating more awareness about data protection and resulting in the \u201cdatafication\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we are not sure of the specifics of the agency\u2019s duties, Suleiman says the NDPB will consolidate the gains of the NDPR and support the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\n\nFor now, we can say with certainty that Vincent Olatunji will head the NDPB as National Commissioner/CEO.\n\nOlatunji served as the Acting DG of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) until October 2016 before handing over to Pantami, nine months after his appointment.\n\nDoes Nigeria have a new Data Protection Authority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this is no.\n\nThe long answer, which requires some explaining, is maybe.\n\nWhen NITDA introduced the NDPR, the agency handed itself some oversight functions, effectively becoming Nigeria\u2019s default Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nBut what are DPAs? According to the European Commission, \u201cDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise, through investigative and corrective powers, the application of the data protection law. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against violations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the relevant national laws.\u201d\n\nSo think of a DPA as a bodyguard to ensure your data rights are protected, and companies don\u2019t get away with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, this would apply to the NDPR\n\nHowever, unlike Europe and other countries \u2014 including some countries in Africa \u2014 NITDA did not create a separate entity to act as a DPA. A scenario that some have argued goes beyond the powers assigned in the NITDA Act.\n\nEssentially, one could argue that NITDA appointing itself DPA is unlawful or, in legal terms, void.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers the Agency to \u201cdevelop guidelines for electronic governance and monitor the use of electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic communication transactions as an alternative to paper-based methods in government, commerce, education, the private and public sectors, labour, and other fields, where the use of electronic communication may improve the exchange of data and information.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the NITDA Act does not appear to give the Agency the power to issue the NDPR in itself. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nGoing by this new development, though, it appears that four years into the NDPR\u2019s regime, we might be getting a DPA in the true sense of the word. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though, because there\u2019s still the pesky problem of an establishing law.\n\nIn most countries, DPAs are created through a governing law or regulation. A presidential approval does not a DPA make, but this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, for which we are cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor now, however, our earlier answers are still valid. Until NITDA or the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy confirms whether the NDPB is a DPA, we can only speculate.\n\nOlumide Babalola, Managing Partner at Olumide Babalola LP, believes that \u201cThe statement is silent on what form the Bureau would take. It reportedly currently shares an office with the National Information Technology Development Agency (\u2018NITDA\u2019).\n\n\u201cHence, as things stand, the Bureau is no more than a department under NITDA as it currently has no separate identity, not even a website where information on its operations can be accessed.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the Data Protection Bill?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman\u2019s statement, the NDPB would \u201csupport the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe race to a dedicated data protection and privacy law has taken several turns. Filled with false starts, the closest Nigeria has come to a law passed by the National Assembly was in 2018 with the Nigeria Data Protection Bill 2018. Although both houses passed it in 2019, President Buhari withheld his assent.\n\nThe most successful attempt remains the NDPR, a guideline at best.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill 2020 (PDF) is currently before the National Assembly, but nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nThe Bill provides a much more robust approach to data protection, providing for more categories of data than the NDPR, which appears to deal more with electronic data. It also creates a Data Protection Commission, which should act as Nigeria\u2019s DPA.\n\nInterestingly, there are rumours that the Bill has been abandoned, and the federal government is seeking a consultant to draft a new one.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBusiness as usual for now.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding the NDPR and NITDA\u2019s power to appoint itself DPA are still dark areas, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now.\n\nThe introduction of the NDPB raises a little wave of dust over Nigeria\u2019s data protection and privacy crate. It raises questions that cannot be adequately answered until we see appropriate legislation or more guidelines and perhaps a \u201cdedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhat follows should make for interesting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

I did, but I saw a recap and the best way to describe my reaction is mind blown \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe event had some boring announcements, like the new iPhone colours and the underwhelmingly designed iPhone SE. To be fair, the SE comes with an impressive spec upgrade, but the design is a total replica of the 2020 SE.\n\nMy guess is that Apple wants you to buy their more high-end products rather than their budget (a $430 phone is not a budget phone ) products. So if you cannot afford the flagships, you should be able to buy the SE. Keyword being should.\n\nThe mind-blowing part of the event for me was when the Mac Studio was announced. A machine the size of a bowl of nkwobi, but with beastly specs. It runs on Apple\u2019s new chip \u2014 M1 Ultra \u2014 eight times faster than last year\u2019s M1 Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a 20 core CPU, up to 8 terabytes of solid-state drive (SSD), and 128 gigabytes of unified memory or RAM.

After spending months looking for a developer to build their product, the duo resorted to no-code tools. They found exciting products that didn\u2019t require any coding expertise. But even a startup built with no-code tools still has challenges.\n\nTheir startup, Ozi, can be described as a Communications as a Service product that Azeez and Akpan started in the university. But as their clientele grew in number and quality, privacy concerns they didn\u2019t consider rose, and they lost a considerable amount of clients.\n\nOzi provides chatbots and helps send bulk messages on WhatsApp. Although other platforms like SMS and email can be leveraged, the startup is doubling down on WhatsApp for several reasons. One of them is open rates.\n\nThe startup has recently closed a $10,000 angel round and has increased its user-base from 100 to 10,000\n\nOne thing I find interesting about Ozi is the different iterations and the challenges the founders have gone through in putting a startup together with no-code tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a startup idea and have zero coding skills, you should read Ogheneruemu\u2019s conversation with Azeez and Akpan: How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi\n\nSmart addressing with OkHi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can find your home address easily on Google Maps, you are one of the very few Africans with a verifiable address. Getting packages delivered to your doorsteps would be hassle-free \u2014 for the most part.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me and your house doesn\u2019t even have a number, then we\u2019re among the 400 million Africans who do not have verifiable addresses. This makes getting deliveries or even opening bank accounts hard.\n\nInterestingly, OkHi, a smart-addressing startup, wants to solve this problem. The startup was built by Timbo Drayson when he noticed Google Maps doesn\u2019t work perfectly in Africa. In 2014, he launched the address verification startup in Kenya, verifying over 300,000 addresses so far.\n\nOkHi expanded into Nigeria after a $1.5 million seed and a partnership with Interswitch. Yesterday, it also announced another $1.5 million seed extension from investors, including Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola and Interswitch.\n\nOkHi had a conversation with Chimgozorim, and they discussed how the startup is providing address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart-addressing startup, OkHi has announced a seed extension round of $1.5 million after a seed round of the same amount in 2020. Following the close of this seed round, the startup is set to focus on onboarding more institutions as it works towards having one million verified addresses in its database by 2022.\n\nThis round had new and existing investors such as Founders Factory Africa, Betatron, Interswitch, Chapel Hill Denham, and Flutterwave executives; other investors include EXFI (a syndicate of ex-Google employees) and Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola.\n\nSince the 1960s, when much of Africa gained independence, the urbanisation rate has grown rapidly. At the time of gaining independence, 80% of the population lived in rural areas. However, that figure currently stands at 50% and keeps growing annually.\n\nThis growth has been accompanied by the challenge of a proper addressing system for the continent. According to the United Nations, about 400 million of the 4 billion people who have no addresses live in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of a proper addressing system presents governments, service providers, and residents with numerous problems. For example, how is an eCommerce business supposed to deliver an order to the correct location without a reliable method of verifying a customer\u2019s address?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder and CEO of OkHi, Timbo Drayson\n\nUnsurprisingly, this challenge results in businesses losing tons of money while lives are lost because essential services providers can\u2019t reach their locations.\n\nIn Nigeria, anyone opening a bank account has to submit documentation for address verification. For most people, this is a utility bill. A human agent deployed by the bank then steps out to verify the address on the utility bill supplied by the prospective customer. Apparently, this method is inefficient and unreliable as some people may not have a valid utility bill and would have to use utility bills that do not belong to them.\n\nWhile travelling across Africa in 2014, Timbo Drayson, an ex-Googler, discovered that Google Maps did not work perfectly in Africa. With this realisation, he built OkHi in Kenya to provide address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups.\n\nWhile there have been solutions such as Google\u2019s \u201cPlus Codes,\u201d OkHi\u2019s solution is different because it focuses on addressing people and not locations.\n\nVerifying one million addresses\n\nIn December 2020, the startup launched in Nigeria after reportedly verifying over 300,000 addresses in Kenya. This launch also saw it partner with fintech giant, Interswitch, which doubles as an investor. Drayson explained the reason for this move on a call with Techpoint Africa.\n\n\u201cWe showed some amazing success in Kenya where we were focused on solving the addressing problem for delivery businesses, and we showed great traction. However, the goal and the vision of OkHi has always remained the same, which is to enable half the world who don\u2019t have a physical address to be included.\n\n\u201cA great use case for that is address verification and being able to use your address to help onboard financial services. What we found when we tried to approach this in Kenya was that it wasn\u2019t the best place to basically build and go to market with address verification.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike Nigeria, Kenya has a vast mobile money market dominated by Safaricom and M-Pesa. Consequently, fintech startups cannot generate as much traction as their Nigerian counterparts. A meeting with Interswitch was also a significant factor in the startup\u2019s decision to move to Nigeria.\n\nWith broad coverage of the Nigerian market, Interswitch offers the startup the opportunity to tap into its vast network of financial institutions. In October 2021, OkHi announced a partnership with Quickteller that enables its customers to verify their addresses digitally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s great about Interswitch is essentially that they already serve our target user base, which is both consumers that need to have verified addresses and the banks and fintechs that need to use it,\u201d Drayson stated.\n\nIn addition to Quickteller, OkHi is running a pilot program with Stanbic IBTC Bank \u2014 a Nigerian commercial bank \u2014 that enables the bank\u2019s customers to verify their addresses digitally. Based on this partnership, Drayson noted that in addition to being more accurate, OkHi\u2019s solution is four times faster than human agents and can be done at half the cost.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have a very rich pipeline of customers, both banks and fintechs that are currently integrating or going live in pilot. Our focus is just to execute on that and make sure that by 2022, we have about a million people using OkHi and verifying their addresses with us.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing users with a digitally verifiable address, the startup\u2019s solution can notify businesses when a user changes their address. To do this, it makes use of data from their smartphone.\n\nSuch technology could create privacy concerns for users, and Drayson revealed that it allows users to opt out of using the solution whenever they like. In addition, they also adhere to the guidelines stipulated by the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).\n\nBreaking down OkHi\u2019s business model\n\nAddress verification can be broken down into three major categories: collecting an accurate address, verifying the address, and delivering to the address.\n\nOkHi has three products \u2014 OkCollect, OkVerify, and OkGo \u2014 covering these functions. OkCollect uses a photo and GPS to verify addresses; OkVerify uses data from a customer\u2019s phone, while OkGo serves as a Google Maps of sorts, enabling anyone to navigate OkHi addresses.\n\nWhile customers can use their OkHi addresses for free, OkHi charges businesses \u20a6500 (~$1) every time they verify a customer\u2019s address using OkHi. Although other startups provide verification services in Nigeria, most focus on document and identity verification.\n\n\u201cWhile there are a number of identity verification players who do document and biometric verification, for example, Smile Identity, most of them are more potential partners than competitors because while they offer full digital KYC solutions to businesses, they do not provide digital address verification. Therefore, there\u2019s an opportunity for us to power their address verification digitally,\u201d Drayson told Techpoint Africa.\n\nBuilding as pioneers\n\nBuilding a business comes with unique challenges, and Drayson shares that most of their challenges come with playing in a new space with no blueprint to follow. Consequently, they have had to convince investors and customers alike of the merits of their solution.\n\n\u201cAs a new business and technology that the world has never seen before, we have had to work hard to earn the trust of our early adopters, who are the pioneers taking our solution to market.\n\n\u201cWhile we have raised over $4m in total to date, and of course, there is still a lot of learning along the way; ultimately, we\u2019re inventing a new category of business here. It\u2019s an untrodden path with no proof points anywhere in the world, so it\u2019s just been perseverance to close the investors we have today, who I\u2019m thankful to for their money and advice.\u201d\n\nWhile the focus is currently on financial institutions, there are plans to start offering services to other sectors such as food delivery, ride-hailing, and eCommerce in 2022. Having tried and succeeded in Kenya, the startup would be in familiar territory if that were to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "In a season where many forward-thinking countries have adjusted their retail price of petrol to reflect current global realities, Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country has remained docile.\n\nOil shot above $100 per barrel for the first time in years the day Russia invaded Ukraine and has climbed sharply higher since.\n\nAs a result of this development, countries like the United States, Ghana and Egypt have adjusted their petrol prices to reflect the current realities.\n\nFor instance, in the US, petrol prices jumped by 55 cents a gallon in a week. According to data from the American Automobile Association the national average of petrol in the country is now $4.17.\n\nIn neighbouring Ghana, the development is the same.\n\nAccording to the Automobile Dealers Union Ghana, petrol is now selling for GHC 8.29 per litre ($1.18), about 25 percent increase from GHC 6.65 per litre ($0.95) at the start of the year.\n\nIn Egypt, the government raised the prices of several types of vehicle fuel last month.\n\nThe per litre price of 80-octane gasoline (a type of petrol) rose from 7 to 7.25 Egyptian pounds ($0.54-$0.64), while 92-octane gasoline rose from 8.25 to 8.50 pounds ($0.53-$0.54) and 95-octane gasoline rose from 9.25 to 9.50 pounds ($0.59-$0.60).\n\nWhile other countries are adjusting their pump price, Nigeria finds itself in a rattrap situation.\n\nThe government is insisting on keeping the price of petrol cheap at N165 ($0.40) for a vast majority of its 200 million people, who see cheaper fuel as the only benefit they see from a state that built no social-safety net for its citizens during the oil boom.\n\nThe ballooning fuel subsidy has been a major cost the country has had to bear.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2021, Nigeria\u2019s subsidy bill soared to N6trillion, an amount which was far higher than funds allocated to education, health, defense and agricultural and rural development that would have increased the economic growth or standard of living of its people.\n\nNigeria\u2019s obsession with subsidy continued in 2022, as the federal government budgeted a whooping N3trillion, a development that has knocked investor confidence and deterred economic growth.\n\nBeyond the issues of subsidy, Nigeria is also battling with weak oil production.\n\nData sourced from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) showed Nigeria recorded an average oil production of 2.5 million bpd in 2011 but this has plunged to 1.5mbpd in 2020 and 1.3mbpd in 2021.\n\nBut the dynamics of oil are much deeper. Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production has been languishing at only two-thirds of its full capacity this year, especially many of its large oil fields in the Niger Delta.\n\nKey Nigerian grade Forcados had been disrupted for almost a month until Shell lifted force majeure on loadings last September. Industry sources said the suspension of exports was due to an oil spill near the Forcados terminal.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy set to surpass N3.36tn oil revenue\n\nOther Nigerian crudes such as Bonny Light, Escravos, and Qua Iboe have also faced production issues in recent months due to operational and technical reasons.\n\nDolapo Oni, an international oil and gas expert familiar with Nigeria\u2019s petroleum sector says Nigeria\u2019s top 10 oil fields over the last decade have shed over 25percent of output.\n\n\u201cThese top oil fields were mostly replaced with many smaller oilfields, which were not fully optimized, therefore not sustainable,\u201d Oni tweeted.\n\nIndustry data has also revealed Nigeria\u2019s crude oil reserves declined by about 600 million barrels on the back of reducing investments in the last few years.\n\nInformation from the British Petroleum (BP) Statistical Review, 2021 indicated that between 2017 and 2020, a three-year period, Nigeria\u2019s reserves did not grow, but rather fell from 37.5 billion barrels to 36.9 billion barrels in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time a 100 kbd field came online in Nigeria?\u201d Oni asked.",

Ketron retained the name under a franchise arrangement, and said after the deal that it would sell more Nigerian-made products.\n\nIn exiting Nigeria, Shoprite followed the steps of other foreign companies from Mr Price Group to Woolworths and Truworths International that had also come unstuck following similar operational challenges.\n\n\u201cAny business based on importation of finished goods will struggle in Nigeria due to the challenges in obtaining foreign exchange,\u201d a senior Nigerian banker told BusinessDay. \u201cUnless you are permanently sourcing dollars from the black market, which foreigners are afraid of since it is illegal.\u201d\n\nNigeria has never contributed a dominant share to the sales of the group.\n\nThe group\u2019s core business, which is the South African unit, has contributed over seven percent to sales and profit every year since at least 2012. In 2020, for instance, Supermarkets RSA contributed 78 percent of group sales. The non-RSA markets, the category for Shoprite\u2019s operations outside South Africa, including Nigeria, accounted for 22 percent.\n\nRead also: Meetings Africa: Reigniting continent\u2019s economy\n\nThe supermarket retailer had expanded aggressively in Africa, surpassing rivals such as Pick n Pay and Walmart\u2019s majority-owned Massmart to become the continent\u2019s leading food retailer, with more than 2,800 stores in 15 countries.\n\nBut forays into markets including Angola and Nigeria, were marred by currency volatility, double-digit inflation, high import duties and dollar-based rentals. It also exited Kenya and restricted capital allocations to its supermarkets outside South Africa.\n\nThe terms of the sale of the Nigerian business to Ketron also includes an administration and services agreement, which provides the business with administration and technical support from the Shoprite Group for an initial period of five years.\n\nShoprite said 70 percent of the transaction proceeds had been received at the time of announcing the deal with the balance due in four equal instalments over 30 months.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW WITH PROFESSOR ABHUERE ON 2023 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE WAY FORWARD FOR EDO STATE. \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nCan you tell us about yourself?\n\nOnce again, thank you. Welcome to my world. I\u2019m Professor John Abhuere currently professor of development and management. I retired, as many persons know, as director of NYSC after which I went into writing, management consultancy and lately into academics. I set up a foundation which is called Centre for Child Care and Youth development where we try to put some of the ideas we believe in into practice. We have an office in Abuja and the headquarters in Uromi. It is for that reason I\u2019m in Benin City, Edo state to see how the one in Uromi is faring.\n\nProfessor you are welcome to this interview. There are some burning issues we want you to vent your ideas on. First, it is about power rotation or zoning which ever one it is called in the political sphere of Nigeria bearing in mind the upcoming 2023 general elections. What do you have to say about power rotation in Nigeria?\n\nI\u2019m happy you raised this issue if you\u2019ve been following my writing, I\u2019m a sincere advocate of zoning and power rotation as a basis of making reasonable progress in this country, as a basis of having stability in this country, as a basis of promoting participating democracy of all citizens of this country. But for you to know why we are really passionate about zoning you, first of all know the evolution of democracy how it came about, the development so far within the democratic world e.t.c. If you remember or cast your mind back to the relevant literature we were told that democracy started in the Greek city state and the idea really was that every person should have an opportunity to participate in the development or political process of the community so that every person should gather in a community or square for them to take decision on issues that affect them but the city-states were small and people were few. So it wasn\u2019t really possible as the world continues to develop to congregate in one place. We have a situation where in the 5bc to 17th or 18th century. Lets take that big gap, you find America coming up reviewing the whole thing to have a representative democracy as opposed to monarchy which means what they are working against is the advent of dictatorship. So everyone that has been very democratic wants as much as possible, people\u2019s representation. So you find America came up with a novelty approach very different from what the Greek had about representative democracy where you will have your own representative in government making laws on your behalf.\n\nMany parts of the world have seen this variance of democracy today but the point I\u2019m trying to say is that democracy has never been static. It has been expanding, changing in definition or scope. One thing has however remained the need for people to participate. The more the better. I should correct a thing. Even when people like Abraham Lincoln defined democracy as a government of the people, by the people and for the people something of that nature. You, find out that not everyone in America was given the chance to participate. Blacks and slaves initially were not allowed to participate. Even in Greece when it started, it were the citizens that were allowed to vote.\n\nYou find out democracy as a system is where people have been struggling to participate. It took some time for the black man in America to vote. Also it took time for the woman in America and many part of the world to vote. So if you apply this theoretical background in Nigeria we find out that the British helped in establishing the kind of democracy we have with Nigerians participating in bringing it about. But you find from the beginning the democratic space was dominated by a few people the big tribe. If you look at it, again because the minority group wanted a place to participate, it saw them struggling. All this talk on Niger-delta has been there also, the tiv movement.\n\nThey were all about attempt to participate in the democratic space. We find a situation where Nigeria was moving and we began to see the need to balance up. That was why during the military administration then, take back to when Tafawa Balewa was the prime minister Nnamdi Azikiwe was the governor general, the power was being tried to balance up. Then in the military, somebody from the North trying to balance up being the head of government then Chief of staff position to South. We now came to 1993 election, the best ever conducted election that was annulled by the then military administration. Then between 1993 and 1999 there were series of conflict in this country until the same military that created the problem sat and handover. But they made sure the two most popular political parties presidential candidates end up being presented to the people from the same zone. That is why we have Abiola vs Falashe and Abiola eventually won. That alone, trying to zone the political process to the West brought enormous stability to the Yorubas to be brought to the fold and we achieve some reasonable level of development.\n\nNow, if you look at the arithmetic, we have a section of the country with evidence that for a long time they\u2019ve not been allowed to participate seriously at the highest political level in the country and that region continue to boil and what affects one region affects the other and you cannot rule that one out. Power, in a multi- cultural country like Nigeria, you cannot afford to say politics or power must go to the highest winner, no it has to be divided, it has to be zoned so that every region will have a fraction of it. In fact, the whole process of the winner takes all is wrong as power has to be proportional to the vote you won in an election. That\u2019s a matter for another day.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that if we really want stability, cooperation, development and also collective responsibility of every person to the development and promotion of national unity in this country, zoning is the answer, it is the solution to minority neglect whether at the state level or not. It is about proper power-sharing and assurance that once upon a time it will come down to your turn in many states including ours. If you don\u2019t zone power there are some minority groups that will never smell power and they belong to the same country. So do you think they will be happy?\n\nSo my own commitment to the idea of zoning or rotation of power is that it is imbibed, it is what democracy is all out to achieve. Without people trying to recognize it, if you exclude any group from power, democracy itself is being threatened. This is my submission. We may really need to sit down. This is the year we really need to think about it. 2022 is the year that will bring about 2023. So my appeal is that the people and political parties need to sit down and zone presidential candidate to the South-East. I say it again they should zone their presidential ticket to the South-East because every zone in this country has presidential material and when you really look at it again it is unfair. Injustice is the beginning of conflict in any society. A group that feels unjustly treated will always seek a way out to seek for justice. If from 1960 the great Zik can be regarded, in modern times, as the father of Nigeria nationalism, he didn\u2019t cling to political executive power. We had Ironsi he stayed in power briefly and when you look at the history of this country, if you talk about those who made their own selfless contribution to the building of this country the Ibo people come first. We can not afford to exclude them from the political process and expect peace. We can never have it.\n\nThis is not to say that there will be no competition. There will still be competition. The only thing is that it\u2019s limited to a zone such that one person will come and if somebody comes from the southeast as the president another person comes from the North or anywhere, the country will be better off. Development will have trust. These have all been destroyed because of present system of saying a dominant group must take power. It doesn\u2019t work out that way and I think I\u2019m saying this in the interest of national unity, national development and in the interest of peace in this country that is where zoning and rotation of power comes in.\n\nSo you are in variably asking that it should be entrenched in the Constitution?\n\nYeah, it is not there as a chapter but the idea of zoning is there. We are told that the federal government and the state government should ensure, in the appointment of people to offices, that the different geographical zones are represented. That is the federal character. So when you have it in structure, why is there no application in the political arena? So it is there. So the concept of citizens, participation is very germane to the success of any democratic process otherwise it\u2019s not democracy.\n\nAlright, let us look at the call by some state governors for clamp down on illegal refineries. Wike of Rivers State has been very vocal on this area asking for it to be closed down, what is your take on this sir?\n\nWell, I have looked at what people are saying on this issue. We have to be very careful. Before you embark on the pursuit of certain policies, you have to look at the context (circumstances) that led to certain things. First of all, let me clear the fact that I don\u2019t support any form of illegality. That is the point. We need to know what we are trying to do. This is an oil rich country that has consistently imported refined products into this country. We export crude oil out. There are assumptions here. How will we say we don\u2019t have the technical know-how to refine? That is why we send crude oil out or we lack the resources to do so. That is financial capital. It is very evident government has given out licences that were not utilized which means it is expensive to do or it could be an ideological reason also for saying it is cheaper to export crude oil and to import refined products. All these reasons did not allow us to have what I will call meeting the supply and demand of the country. The meaning is that there is a huge gap to be filled in economics of development. The moment there is a demand, there will be supply. It is natural. What we are having in Nigeria is a gap that allow the growth of illegal refineries but the question you have to ask yourself is in an economy that there is hopeless unemployment, is it the correct thing to actually be closing so-called refineries. The wrong impression is given you know.\n\nThat reminds me of the illicit gin of those days. They say the gin produce in sapele is raw. No, the point is this we need to produce to have more employment, we need to produce to have more to consume at home. We give the false impression that we cannot actually produce oil but we have seen from all memos that during the Biafra war, families were producing petroleum from their backyard. So the technology is there. What I expect us to do is this rather than clamping them down, it is to invite them to a meeting, take census, give them conditions and study what can be done.\n\nI think the government promised modular refineries, where are they? So we are crying in this country that we lack technical know how, we lack the capacity and we are seeing a group. Whether they like it or not am more interested in trying to know something about the quality. Is the product they are coming out with useable and how could government tax them and tap them into the economic mainstream. These are the issues I think Governor Wike and co should sit down also with the federal government and see that these people have it. Do we actually need to carry out over \u2013 regimented regulation of the sector? No! If this people really have the technology and it is as simple and they can produce, it will be better for the country to tap into it and help them improve their system, empower them if our borders were well-manned, smuggling itself will go down, the market for illegal refineries will not be there. We have to, first of all, do our home work. I know that people are burning some of their houses. They are being driven underground and I\u2019m saying the more you do this one, the more they go underground, so they become more dangerous. I don\u2019t see or encourage sabotage but I do think that they have some technology, some knowledge, you know, to sell and that the best thing is for the government to tap unto the existing technology to see what can be done to improve the sector.\n\nProfessor thank you so much for dwelling on the usefulness of bringing operators of illegal refineries together. That is harmonise, rather than destroying them or chasing them out of existence. We want to look at another issue very important in Nigeria. The youths. The number is increasing and they have challenges. The country is blessed with a lot of human resources among them are youths. As it is today, how do you perceive the Nigerian youth vis a vis the prospect of the country?\n\nWell this is a very important question. In my book the \u201cPower of Youth\u201d I try to explain why we must invest in the youth. Let\u2019s take a simple theoretical perspective of the youth. They can be defined as an idealistic human being who aspires for the best of a society and the meaning of this is that the youth can easily be bought into something that is good and could also easily rebel when what you have told them is the standard is being deviated from. Almost every protest we\u2019ve had take this nature. They are idealistic and they now express disappointment.\n\nAnother aspect is that youths can actually be always educated to be positive. In other words, we have two aspects or sides of the youth; positive side and the negative side. Negative side is when you don\u2019t give them opportunity to create or participate, to beat their own knowledge e.t.c. and the positive comes out when you create opportunities. So you find out that the easiest ways to really mobilize youths are through education, employment. Education which can\u2019t come from the family could come from the government, also the school. But you must find them employment to engage themselves because as they say the idle man is the devil\u2019s workshop. The youths also need empowerment in the direction the society wants to go.\n\nThis means creating opportunities. Take for instance, government can\u2019t do it alone. We do know that. Look at Nollywood, opportunities it has created for young people. So if government can even, in each of the states, build three or four stadia for people to learn how to play tennis, golf, cricket and engage in other sports it is already empowering them. So coming back now, what I\u2019m trying to say is that unless there\u2019s a deliberate policy to improve the youth in nation-building activities in a very creative way, many of them will be doomed.\n\nOkay now, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is a very good example of what you can do with young people and how best to utilize young people. They are there serving under the sun and in the rain also because they have been made to behave that way. They see the benefit towards it.\n\nSo in 2022, we are looking at 2023 facing the role of young people in election most especially, members of NYSC who go to serve as officials during elections. Many have been recruited as thugs. Many recruited for bad purposes by the elite. So the first thing is to focus on each party to ensure that in 2022 the mind of the youths should be addressed to play more positive roles. They should be addressed to support the party they feel will win. What even stops the youths supporting one party heavily in order to secure some positions within that party and see if and when the candidate wins, the candidate will be friendly with youth-beneficial programs.\n\nI\u2019m trying to say that the zoning system I mentioned before, if the youth can be made to see the benefit of it, if the youth can made to see that democracy pays also if the youth are made to participate in campaign against corruption during election and development program that can make society grow like promotion of positive value and discipline in the society, it will be better off.\n\nThere is no doubt at all government must be ready to spend or to invest much more in the youth than they are presently doing and you cannot ask somebody that is hungry to go to the moon when there is nothing on ground. If you don\u2019t provide employment, for example, the temptation of the youth falling for anything available is very, very high. They can be recruited into banditry, terrorism, fraud because at that particular time what is available to them is better than what they have which becomes more attractive and if you have bothered to know what happens in terrorist camp you will know that they spend so much money in trying to win their heart.\n\nIt takes real ideological conviction or faithful belief when you go throw a missile and die that there\u2019s heaven waiting for you, which is a kind of brain-washing. I\u2019m not saying that the Nigerian youth should be so brainwashed, I\u2019m saying if you give employment to the Nigerian youth and proper empowerment to do certain things like we are talking about illegal refineries, you call them together and give proper supervision to the youth. If done, this year they will be better even in 2023 especially during the conduct of the general election.\n\nSir, we have to digress a little from the issues of youths to the intervention of state in the economic process of the Nigerian state. What do you have to say about it?\n\nNigeria, in my view, is a victim of wrong ideological position. You see, the state during Obasanjo\u2019s administration, people will tell you the government has no business with the states, marketing. The government investment in business failed all over. It lost a foundation.\n\nThe state was formed for two primary purpose. Firstly, to give you protection. Secondly, security of life and property, then to create an atmosphere for you to realize your objective in life in terms of welfare. Now when you take it from that position you find out that the state, even from the beginning, was supposed to sit people down to say okay let\u2019s surrender these powers to one strong person that will ensure that they will be free trade, security and others.\n\nAlso, let somebody tell me the state that has developed in this world without government intervention. America is a very good model because it sat down and say look we want to form a country and if you look at the first hundred years of America, even till this moment, America government laid the foundation of railway, telecommunication, city-building and others. So now, the meaning of this is that if there is infrastructure, you just have to make sure that this is a community. There is water, there is electricity, there are good roads and when these are already done, individuals can come and tap into this and ensure the development of that community.\n\nWe cannot in a way run state determination. However, what happened was that around the 1970s, because the argument of whether the state should intervene or not was there when Adams Smith said the wealth of nation is dependent on the free trade across borders. He was projecting an ideological position and if you look at the literature of that period too you will find people who opposed to Adams Smith\u2019s thesis saying that it was wrong and that the state has a role to play and you cannot afford open all your borders to free trade. We see it today. America still controls its borders. Now in the 1970\u2019s, especially Margaret Thatcher in England stated that her father has always been a conservative all her life. She had groceries, her economic outlook contrilled by a private person she never ever liked, so she came up with the idea that it\u2019s very wrong for the economic activities to be in government hand and that government is too inefficient. Now Reagan came up in America supported the idea of free trade and they were able to buy the press and use the western press to support the idea that free market-base approach is really worth it.\n\nTake Nigeria, where are the private men the rich men? Count them they are there and even the rich private men, they got the money from the government in the first instance. So we really have not got the capital base to say we should do our things ourselves at this level. When government gave licenses for, at least, I think 11 and later 20 refineries, did Nigeria have the capital to establish? No they didn\u2019t and those licenses were there so we have to have the capital.\n\nSecondly, historically, when you tell the state not to participate, who will do the infrastructure development that bring, about other development. Thirdly, if you take the census of private people who had invested and loss compare it to the government own is inconsequential. Everyday people invest and loose their own capital. They are not told not to invest again, or why not sit down say why did government firms fail in Nigeria. I have personally looked at it I found out that the reason is politics you set up a multi-million or multi-billion naira enterprise instead of you to go out to look for the best hand whether it\u2019s in Jerusalem to help you run it you say no it must be an Esan man that Esan man doesn\u2019t have it, or it must be a Kanuri person who doesn\u2019t have it, no thinking of competence or about the investment being made. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe person has to know it. That\u2019s why me, I\u2019m very crazy about capacity- building. If you don\u2019t have it you don\u2019t have it. Okay take a pen write with your left hand if you will be able to write with it. You won\u2019t be able but the person who can will take the pen and write with the left hand. Capacity building is there. That was the secret of Awolowo, that\u2019s the secret of America, that\u2019s the secret of China.\n\nWhat are we talking about here. We had a kind of ideological mis-step especially in the 1980\u2019s when Babaginda came into power. He started experimenting market economy, it just didn\u2019t work out so why don\u2019t we have the courage. When this administration came, I wrote. Then Obey Ezekwesili suggested government shouldn\u2019t set up a national airways I said government should set it up even if that can give job to three people alone, it is enough but we will keep on developing ourselves. Eight years almost gone. We\u2019ve not been able to establish one whereas nothing stops a local government from investing or having a small refinery or from conquering the bush and making a huge agricultural land and engage competent youths to work.\n\nThe train has come now. What stop the state government from constructing a railway from Benin City to Uromi, Benin City to warri, Benin City to Asaba then you see the ease of movement of goods and services. We have killed the best instrument or regulated the instrument we had in development by saying the state has no role to play. The state\u2019s major role is development. It has a duty to lead development. This doesn\u2019t mean that it should not allow private sector.\n\nThe China that is developed today there are companies that are government- owned operated under the private sector skills. Take one Kobo in China and see if you will not be executed, you will! For financial crimes they send messages to your family for you to commit suicide and if you fail they execute you.\n\nThese are issues we should really think about, what should we do and this is the message whether the federal or state government, it must be prepared to invest in the infrastructure development of this country and as much as possible in areas they think are critical to economic survival and development of this country, that\u2019s number one.\n\nTwo, we need a system where the economy is free and open to both the private sector and the government, in other words, to all that are willing and capable without any hindrance. In other words, if Mr. A is capable of going into this office let him do it, if the government has the capability let it go and do it. Absence of such arrangements or understanding is what is killing the economy.\n\nThree, development should be seeing as a deliberate act to enhance the wealth of an individual and the community he lives. So if my community is so far away and there is no lucky person that is rich, my community should be develop, the local government should ensure development. We can\u2019t fold the hands of the state government and expect development to come.\n\nThe private sector all over the world has no business other than trying to make profit for itself. In economics, when you teach you say they create value. What value are they creating. Value that enhances their personality. That is why America talks about individualism which is about you having a right to produce and get the whole world to yourself. Throw it back to the ocean it doesn\u2019t matter anymore because it\u2019s your own. We are now saying yes you can create all these things let the state also create it\u2019s own. If you like, you may decide to throw this away whereas the state will like its own production given to the human being.\n\nSo what I\u2019m trying to say by my constant preaching on state intervention is that the state should wake up to its responsibility, first and foremost, in protecting people and producing condition for them to develop. You don\u2019t run away from your responsibility under the pretense of one ideological reasoning. So when you say the state shouldn\u2019t, they are all deceiving themselves. We are saying time has come if we say, vote you for a position, if you know unemployment of 20% this year you should allow it go down to 5% and you can\u2019t do anything without investing in the country. So the truth is that the state has a responsibility.\n\nLong before the internet do you know how much America invested in the development of internet. So what it means is the state must not go to sleep with the pretense that it has no business. That idea is just the imagination of some people in Europe who have no idea on how societies in Africa are run. True, we are so poor that the real instrument we have is the state. Yet the government is to bring about the centre of activities and raise money to carry out projects. We need to sit down and look for competent hands, the right hand. There\u2019s nothing stopping the government from investing. For instance, what is it doing in NNPC, is it not a public establishment, why are they carrying our mineral exploration? So government should be asked to do the needful for us.\n\nYou have exhaustively dealt with the issue of state intervention. Lastly sir, we also want you to give a piece or two advice to the Edo state government in its effort to redefine governance and introduce reforms into the state civil service?\n\nI will say this one without any bias. Every person knows me and my development approach of Obaseki. This explains why I wrote and supported him during the election. One thing visible you can\u2019t take from him is that he has a kind of architectural taste, the new buildings. Like the John Odigie Oyegun Civil Service Academy building, it\u2019s a very beautiful piece of work. But then as for the reforms in the civil service, we need to be very careful when we are talking about reforms. What I think we need is general agenda where people say, okay thirty years time, non of us will be around but we know an agenda has been set towards which every person will be walking to and the reform that I will want is a reform that is based on capacity-building that will be about the skills of the civil and public servant to enable him deliver.\n\nTwo, to actually create a sense of pride. What I want call \u2018ideological orientation\u2019 of the average Edolite such that they see themselves as belonging to the same entity. I remember in the days of Bendel, we were Bendelites, There was that pride whether you are in Warri, Asaba. When it comes to sport we were always winning, so we need to create that sense of pride and loyalty to Edo state by it\u2019s citizens.\n\nThen three, the environment of work needs to be made conducive you know because, why I\u2019m always suspicious of reform is that it is always a disguise way of down-sizing. We may down-size the houses but it has many implications. It could create disaffection within the family, it could make sure that people, who hitherto were supportive, are alienated and it could lead to no result, no gainful result. If you enhance the environment in which an individual works, you enhance his skills, knowledge, competence and you promote his sense of fulfillment in terms of pride and belonging.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that for me, the little I have seen, I like his development approach, his strategies that try to reach every corners of the state but this reform is easy, it easier to say reform than to actually get the benefit of reform for a number of reasons; cultural resistance, lack of funds to do the right thing, lack of the vision and ability to carry out or drive it. These are issues but result can be achieved, like I said, through capacity-building (training the individual.).\n\nWhen we can now train dog to catch thief, to catch criminals then you can think of what human beings can do if given decent training, training is it, Like I usually say if you don\u2019t know how to write with your left hand you have to be trained on how to write with your left, if you are right hand person that is my basic example. So you have to train.\n\nThen the condition in which you work if it is not conducive you can\u2019t produce any change. The tools to work are very, very critical. If the tools are not there you cannot perform magic. This is the thing. Then, my advice infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure. the aim should be that each community in Edo-State should have at least water, should have electricity, should have roads. How this is going to be done is a subject for another day. If he consults me I will tell him what should be done because that\u2019s my area of interest, I wish the state luck and a prosperous 2022.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nTHE stage is gradually set for the ultimate senatorial slot for 2023 general election as Ehia Olu Akhabue stages pragmatic stake for Edo Central Senatorial District.\n\nThe uniqueness of his ideas for equitable representation, his seminal thoughts on prodigious community development, his forthrightnesss in articulation of our collective aspiration and the tellingly magnificent road map for actualising it is more than enough to endear the humane people of Esanland to his vision.\n\nHis experiences, spanning over two decades in management of human and industries, home and abroad signposted him as the \u2018primus inter pares\u2019 and clearly a shining star in the political wilderness of the Nigerian State.\n\nInterestingly, history has been magnanimous with the Esan people, having endowed them with the best and brightest as demonstrated by the likes of Chief Anthony Enahoro, Ambrose Alli, Chief Tony Anenih, Christopher Abebe, Comrade Elijah Okougbo of blessed memory and many more.\n\nWithout a doubt, his senatorial aspiration has changed the dynamics of the political superstructure of Edo Central Senatorial District where in recent past, our sons and daughters have been hoisting themselves up for political offices without integrity, required principles and solid agenda for viable and enduring community development.\n\nFor Akhabue, he has resolved to pursue and prosecute the objectives contained in his evergreen Manifesto of Service which is critically built on four fundamental pillars, namely; provision of Water Supply In Edo Central Senatorial District, Formidable Security Architecture to meet the challenges posed by criminal elements, Investment in manpower development/Skills Acquisition, lastly, linking Rural Communities to Urban Centres thereby promoting rural \u2013 urban Integration.\n\nMany of the rural communities in Edo Central have no good roads, infact, they are such in a terrible state of disrepair that farmers face serious difficulties in getting their produce out of the communities to market places in urban areas. The implication of this is that the communities are almost cut off from cities. Akhabue\u2019s mission in the Senate is clear on this, which includes but not limited to ensuring that many roads across Esanland are rehabilitated and reconstructed with the allocations for the constituency projects across board.\n\nIn the past, part of the drawbacks have been that meagre resources allocated for projects are not equitably and fairly distributed in all the five local government areas and this has somewhat created apathy and mistrust between the electorate and the politicians. That is part of what Engr Akhabue is out to restructure to the utmost benefits of everyone in Esanland. Once that is done, in addition to the water project, the people would have achieved a reasonable level of rural \u2013 urban fusion.\n\nInterestingly, Engr Akhabue thorough study of every inch of Esanland has laid bare the factors militating against rural growth and peace and stability as there can\u2019t be peace in the midst of chaos and poverty. He has mapped out development strategies for the district to be better managed as soon as he\u2019s elected into the Senate, using data to aggregate the numbers of households, streets, communities and the cities put together, comprehensively.\n\nThis is where Engr Akhabue\u2019s mandate is a collective one and truly altruistic. Having used data for several organisations to improve community planning and delivery of public and private services, as well as help measure progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) elsewhere, domesticating same for our people in Esanland has become his primary objective as we progress gradually towards 2023 general election. And for Esan people \u2013 baring our history \u2013 can\u2019t ask for less.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We have a security information database where we record security incidents in the state.\n\n\u201cFrom it, we discovered that there is a correlation between drug use and the incidence of insecurity. The local government where we have the highest incidence of drug use also has the highest incidence of criminality and insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe must tackle illicit drugs by firming up regulations and strengthening structures and institutions within government and the profession to have more control over the use of drugs in the country. We must begin to work together to achieve this great task over the use of drugs.\u201d\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to ensuring quality and efficient healthcare delivery to Edo people, the governor said, \u201cWe can no longer centralize healthcare services in the state as our strategy and plan is now to decentralize the healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a central hospital anymore. We must have primary healthcare hospitals across the state to enable our citizens to easily reach healthcare services. Secondary care would be ensured by collaborating and investing in specialist care through specialist hospitals that will be referral centres for our primary healthcare network.\u201d\n\nCalling for the collaboration of pharmacists to provide quality primary healthcare to Edo people, the governor noted that pharmacists are the first port of call for citizens, adding, \u201cIf we have a well-established network of care, we would be able to deal with the issue of adulterated medicine as it will help checkmate illicit drugs. Edo wants to become the nation\u2019s healthcare hub.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the President of PSN, Pharm. Cyril Usifoh commended the governor for prioritizing the health sector, noting, \u201cI thank you for taking healthcare issues seriously by establishing the Edo Health Insurance Scheme to take care of the health of the people of the state. We urge you to reactivate the task force for counterfeit drugs and medicines to check illicit drugs and save the people from abusing drugs.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Managing Director of Edo Health Insurance, Mr. Rock Amegor said the state is working on how to improve drugs supply chain system in Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) and integrate it into the state\u2019s health insurance system.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Rotimi Akeredolu, Ondo State governor, has backed take over of the APC leadership by Gov Abubakar Sanni Bello, the new acting chairman of the party\u2019s caretaker committee, just as he criticized the ousted chairman, Mai Mala Buni, for trying to destroy the party.\n\nAkeredolu who noted that the decision of Buni, Yobe State governor, to procure a secret court injunction stropping the APC convention billed for March 26 with the intention to continue to lead to party, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for kicking him out.\n\nThe Ondo governor who reacted to recent developments in the ruling party in a statement on Thursday, noted that the firm leadership, candour and honesty exemplified by Buhari deserve no less of support and complimentary responsibilities from all stakeholders.\n\nAkeredolu in the statement titled, \u201cBuni, Pocket-filling Black Legs In Corridors Of Power Tried To Supplant President\u2019s Will-Akeredolu,\u201d noted that \u201cexcept a few \u2018Yahoo, Yahoo Govs\u2019 apologies to Former PGF DG, most of us are resolute behind Bello to salvage the party.\u201d\n\nIn a apparent reference to Buni\u2019s court injunction, the Ondo governor remarked, \u201cno black market judicial procurement can stop convention.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said, \u201cWith nostalgia, one can recall the moments of our struggle as compatriots from all walks of life enunciated and berthed Nigeria\u2019s most ingeniously successful political network. Without being immodest, APC\u2019s birth was a novel instance. The party\u2019s philosophical beacon woven around its ideological leaning was alluring.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the firm leadership, candour and honesty exemplified by Mr President who heads the administration that is the product of the APC deserve no less of support and complimentary responsibilities from all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe installation of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC was beyond a call to service. It was a child of necessity moulded to one, instill discipline in leadership and engender coherence among stakeholders and more importantly, to deepen the Rule of Law in our party.\n\n\u201cHowever, the insidious and appalling happenings within our party in the last few months, especially under the immediate-past leadership clearly posit a huge embarrassment. Without necessarily dwelling on details that are known to critical stakeholders, the path taken lately by Governor Mai Mala Buni, the immediate past head of the CECPC and an indivisible few, is a unenviable trajectory undeserving of our dear party. It is a disdainful narrative.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the courage and determination as well as shrewd sincerity of purpose demonstrated by most of the APC Governors remain a delight. Significantly, the swift response and prompt action taken by Mr President have, in no small means, salvaged our great party from internal scavengers. We indeed, survived a Civilian Coup largely inspired by mischief and incurable lust for power through artificial barricades.\n\n\u201cSuccinctly, aside feeling very delighted as a major stakeholder in the latest successful Rescue Mission, I express my confidence in the ability and capacity of Governor Sanni Bello(ABU LOLO) to take APC through. We, the Governors are for the party except for the few \u201cYahoo, Yahoo\u201d Governors (apologies to Salihu, former DG of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum) who were hand in glove with Buni to circumvent the Will of majority of our Party (APC) members. Progressive Governors in the true name, mostly all of us, are determined to see our Party through these patchy parts at all cost.\n\n\u201cNone of the scanty number has the guts to carry out their imaginary threats as reported in sponsored stories. We dare them to leave the party. Their short-lived antics in armtwisting Governor Buni and probably, some pocketfilling elements within the corridors of power to supplant the President\u2019s will through fake letters, endorsements as well as \u2018Black Market\u2019 injunction (procured since November, 2021) are despicable.\n\n\u201cNow that the clear motive aimed at frustrating our national convention as been botched, our dear party is on the track to greatness. Gov. Sanni Bello, ABU LOLO, carry on; you have the backing of the majority of us. You shall see our FULL backing come Thursday, 17th March, 2022 at the National Executive Committee meeting.\n\n\u201cBut as you know, this is ONLY for the conduct of the NATIONAL CONVENTION.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "Ebonyi: Declare Me Gov, PDP\u2019s Nominee, Igariwey, Tells INEC",
          "text": "Following the judgement of a Federal High Court in Abuja, which sacked the Ebonyi State governor, David Unahi, for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), the replacement put forward by the PDP, Hon Iduma Igariwey has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately declare him the governor of Ebonyi State.\n\nIgariwey, a member of the House of Representatives while addressing journalists on Thursday in Abuja, said the judgment expressly directed INEC to receive names of candidates from the PDP to replace Umahi and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, as the governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi State, respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe lauded the PDP for swftly submitting his name and Fred Udogu to INEC, as governor and deputy governor respectively, to replace Governor Umahi and his deputy, in compliance with the order of court.\n\nThe lawmaker, who represents Afiko North/Afikpo South federal constituency, said without a stay of execution of the judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction, Umahi should step down immediately as going to appeal does not stop obeying the court order.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said Umahi\u2019s continued occupation of the office of governor two days after the judgment was in contempt of the court.\n\nIgariwey said, \u201cTwo days ago, specifically on the 8th day of March 2022, His Lordship Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court Abuja, delivered two judgements concerning Ebonyi State. One is suit No FHC/ABJ/CS/920/2021: The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) v. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and 3 others. The other is suit No FHC/ABJ/CS/1041/2021: The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) v. INEC and 20 others.\n\n\u201cIn the first suit, whose crux is the defection of Governor Umahi and his Deputy from the PDP to the APC, the Court ordered Umahi and his deputy to vacate their seats, and restrained both of them from further parading themselves as Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the other suit, the Court sacked and declared the seats of 15 of the 24 member Ebonyi State House of Assembly vacant, on the same grounds the Governor was removed.\n\n\u201cAt this point, let me thank our party, the Peoples Democratic Party, for the expeditious manner they have taken steps to give effect to the judgment of Justice Inyang Ekwo. This important first step was taken by the party when they submitted the names of Hon. Iduma Igariwey and Fred Udogu to INEC, as Governor and Deputy Governor respectively, to replace Governor Umahi and his deputy, in compliance with the order of Court.\n\n\u201cApart from the order directing Governor Umahi and his deputy to vacate their offices, the court, inter alia, also directed INEC to immediately receive from the PDP the names of its candidates to replace Governor David Umahi and his Deputy, and to declare those names submitted by the PDP, as the Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge that INEC is in receipt of the communication from the National Chairman of the PDP, we call on INEC as a critical pillar of our constitutional democracy, to comply expeditiously with all the consequential orders of the court, particularly, by declaring the names submitted by the PDP as Governor and Deputy Governor. This, the INEC is expected to do, by issuing Certificates of Return.\n\n\u201cFrom the clear and unambiguous order made by Justice Inyang Ekwo, it is an incontrovertible fact that Governor Umahi ceased to be Governor of Ebonyi State on the 8th day of March 2022. Two days after this judgment, Mr Umahi and his deputy still parade themselves as if they still occupy those offices. This is, to say the very least, contemptuous of the clear orders of a court of competent jurisdiction. We recognise the fact that former Governor David Umahi has a right of appeal.\n\n\u201cHowever, until the entire appeal process is exhausted, and in the absence of any order staying the operation of Justice Ekwo\u2019s Judgment, Mr Umahi remains sacked, a former Governor, who should desist from any conduct that threatens the peace of Ebonyi State, or diminishes over constitutional democracy.\n\n\u201cIn the eye of the law, therefore, I, Rt Hon. Iduma Enwo Igariwey and Chief Fred Udogu, are the recognised Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, respectively, effective the 8th day of March 2022.\n\n\u201cAt this point, let me take liberty and address some of the very disturbing comments credited to Mr Umahi in his official reaction to Justice Ekwo\u2019s twin Judgments. Umahi\u2019s reaction, by way of a speech titled \u2018I am still the Governor of Ebonyi State\u2019 was, true to Umahi\u2019s imperial character, a cocktail of attacks, insults, intemperate and highly incendiary expletives, against a judge of competent jurisdiction and the Judiciary as an institution.\n\n\u201cUmahi had described Justice Inyang Ekwo\u2019s judgment as \u2018purchased\u2019, vowed not to obey the judgment, called on his supporters to disregard the judgment, to \u2018laugh over the judgment\u2019, a \u2018useless judgment\u2019 by a \u2018hatchet man\u2019.\n\n\u201cAlthough many well-meaning and patriotic Nigerians have called out Umahi to condemn his wild and incomprehensible incivility, yet, to us Ebonyians, we understand too well that imperial Umahi was only being himself. Have Nigerians suddenly forgotten Umahi\u2019s many battles with the press in Ebonyi State? Just about a year ago, Umahi \u2018banished for life from Ebonyi Government House\u2019, a number of journalists \u2013 Peter Okutu, Chijoke Agwu and others \u2013 for writing stories he did not like.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, Umahi sent thugs to attack a sitting court in Abakaliki and chase away other judges from their court rooms, for delivering a judgment he considered not favourable. It stands to reason that geographical distance is probably what is saving Justice Ekwo from Umahi\u2019s physical assault and harm. This is unacceptable and disgraceful, to say the very least.\n\n\u201cYesterday and today, former Governor Umahi, in continuing contempt of Justice Inyang Ekwo\u2019s judgment which had since removed him from office, is further depleting the scarce resources of Ebonyi people by bossing poverty stricken Ebonyi people from their villages to the state capital, to demonstrate against Justice Ekwo\u2019s judgment. For Ebonyians who know him very well, this is vintage David Umahi.\n\n\u201cHe will deploy all manner of subterfuge and blackmail, to hang onto power, in clear contempt of the order of court that has since removed him from office. To Ebonyi people, your joy and jubilation across the length and breadth of the state upon news that David Umahi has been sacked came to me as no surprise. It is, indeed, a new dawn! You have suffocated enough, and your freedom is near. I assure you that the Party will deploy every legal means to actualise your freedom as symbolised by Justice Inyang Ekwo\u2019s judgment. The era of running Ebonyi State as Umahi, sons and brothers Nigeria Ltd, is soon over. The days of indiscriminate arrests, kidnappings, disappearances and murder in secret detention facilities in Ebonyi State Government House, will soon be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cI urge Ebonyi people to remain calm and peaceful, and go about their normal livelihoods, while civil servants are encouraged to remain vigilant. Security Agencies, the Police, DSS and NSCDC are urged to secure the state by protecting lives and property. This also includes government Property and assets.\n\n\u201cFinally, on a personal note, I and my Deputy would like to thank our great party, the PDP, and our stakeholders from Ebonyi State, for the honour of submitting our names to INEC. We feel honoured, and assure the party and Ebonyians, that the task of redeeming and rescuing Ebonyi State from former Governor Dave Umahi\u2019s brigandage and misrule, is a mission that must be quickly accomplished.\u201d",

          "text": "A proposed sale of Chelsea F.C., one of Europe\u2019s leading soccer teams, was effectively blocked by the British government on Thursday when it froze the assets of the club\u2019s Russian oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich, as part of a wider set of sanctions announced against a group of wealthy Russian businessmen.\n\nThe government, in announcing its actions against Abramovich and six other Russian oligarchs, said it had taken steps to ensure Chelsea would be able to continue its operations and complete its schedule. To protect the club\u2019s interests, the government said, it issued Chelsea a license to continue its soccer-related activities, including a Premier League match at Norwich City on Thursday night.\n\nThe license, which the government said would be under \u201cconstant review,\u201d will ensure that the team\u2019s players and staff will continue to be paid; that fans holding season tickets can continue to attend games; and that the integrity of the Premier League, which is considered an important cultural asset and one of Britain\u2019s most high-profile exports, will not be affected.\n\nBut to ensure that no money flows to Abramovich, the club will no longer be able to sell new tickets to any games or sell merchandise online or in its stores. And its business and daily activities may be seriously complicated, affecting everything from travel to matches to the team\u2019s ability to buy and sell players in soccer\u2019s multibillion-dollar player trading market.\n\nThat ban also could make it impossible for Abramovich to follow through on his previously announced plans to sell Chelsea. Under the new sanctions, the British government will now have complete oversight of that process. The effect would be to heavily diminish any proposed sale price, but it could block a sale entirely since it is unlikely the government would allow such a large transfer of money \u2014 Abramovich was said to be seeking more than $2 billion for Chelsea \u2014 from being paid to an owner under sanctions.\n\n\u201cGiven the significant impact that today\u2019s sanctions would have on Chelsea football club and the potential knock on effects of this, the Government has this morning published a license which authorizes a number of football-related activities to continue at Chelsea,\u201d the British government said in its statement announcing the freezing of Abramovich\u2019s assets. \u201cThis includes permissions for the club to continue playing matches and other football related activity which will in turn protect the Premier League, the wider football pyramid, loyal fans and other clubs. This license will only allow certain explicitly named actions to ensure the designated individual is not able to circumvent U.K. sanctions.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Wednesday said it was yet to appoint any bidder for the proposed Nigeria Air even as it stated that it had at no time selected nor appointed either entity nor individual as preferred bidder for the project.\n\nThe government through the Ministry of Aviation, made this known in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe statement by the Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, James Odaudu, read: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to reports in some media to the effect that Qatar Airways has been chosen as the preferred bidder for Nigeria\u2019s national carrier, Nigeria Air.\n\n\u201cThe report, coming just two days after the issuance of a Request For Proposal which was published in local and international news media, is not only false but capable of discrediting the process for the establishment of the airline, and discouraging interested parties.\n\nIt further read: \u201cWe wish to state that throughout the process leading to the publication of the Request for Proposal, the guiding principle has been transparency and accountability which we promised will remain till the final delivery of the project, and by which we stand.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state categorically that no corporate entity or individual has been appointed or selected, or even preferred for the project as the process for selection has just started with the Request for Proposal.\n\n\u201cAll interested partners and the public are therefore advised to discountenance the report and proceed with their proposals as we assure them of our unalloyed commitment to transparency and accountability till the end of the process.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cOur driving force is the commitment of the Buhari\u2019s administration to bequeath to the country a national carrier that Nigerians would be proud of and our determination and commitment to it remains stoic.\n\n\u201cFinally, we wish to appeal to media practitioners to always confirm information from the right quarters before going to press so as to avoid misleading the public.\u201d",
