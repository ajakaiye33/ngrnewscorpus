          "title": "Why Nigeria needs to achieve herd immunity through COVID-19 vaccination \u2013NPHCDA",
          "text": "Yusuff Moshood\n\nThe Director of Disease Control and Immunisation at the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Bassey Bassey Okposen, says the country needs to achieve herd immunity to protect the citizens against new variants of COVID-19.\n\nHe said the nation should push to vaccinate 70 per cent of the citizens to prevent the mutation of COVID-19 strain in the country as well as better protect Nigerians against new variants.\n\nOkposen, a public health physician and an immunisation expert said if the nation achieved herd immunity through immunisation, Nigerians will be better protected against future variants.\n\nThe NPHCDA official stated this on Tuesday while speaking on Your View \u2013 a TV programme on TVC monitored by PUNCH Healthwise.\n\nAccording to the vaccine expert, Nigerians should get vaccinated against COVID-19 because many more waves of the viral pandemic with different variants of the virus could still come.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need as a nation to achieve herd immunity. This is to ensure that if we are exposed to any variants, we would be protected. We know that the severity of infection in those vaccinated will be less.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t what will come tomorrow. This is because pandemics like COVID-19 come in waves with different severity. We don\u2019t know the variant that will come that could be dangerous for Nigerians. That is why I am pleading with Nigerians and urging them not to take this thing for a joke.\n\n\u201cWe can recall what happened when the Delta variant hit India. It was terrible for India. People were collapsing and dying on the street. Yes, Omicron has come and it seems less severe but yet we can see how some countries reacted to it by imposing lockdown and not allowing people to go out. So we need to take this viral infection seriously.\n\n\u201cOnce we achieve herd immunity as a nation, whatever strain of the virus that comes would be easier to deal with. This is because the severity of the disease will be less and vaccination will also reduce mutations of the virus in the country\u201d.\n\nOkposen also flayed the argument against COVID-19 boosters stressing that vaccination against viral infections usually comes in more doses.\n\n\u201cIf we go back to the history of the poliovirus then you will know that there is nothing different to what is happening to COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThe polio vaccine that we give to children is an example. We give them the first dose at six weeks and then give them a second dose at 10 weeks. We then give them another one at 14 weeks and then supplemental ones follow. It is because it is a virus.\n\n\u201cFor a child to be fully vaccinated against polio, it now takes four oral polio vaccines and one injection. That is five doses. So, we are just starting with COVID-19 and there is nothing to worry about.\n\n\u201cAlso when we give children measles vaccine, it is the same. Once you give 100 children measles vaccine, 85 per cent of them develop 100 per cent immunity at first administration.\n\n\u201cWhen you give them the second dose of the vaccine, 95 per cent develop immunity and when they get the opportunity of the third dose, 98 per cent of them develop immunity. So, it is all about boosting the level of immunity.\n\n\u201cMeasles vaccination before was just one dose but now, it is two doses and then a booster at five years.\n\n\u201cFrom research, the COVID-19 vaccine first dose gives 60 to 65 per cent protection, the second dose takes the protection to 80 to 85 per cent and the booster dose takes the immunity level higher. So, it is necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NPHCDA immunisation expert also noted that data available so far in Nigeria has confirmed that most of those who have died from COVID-19 are those that were not vaccinated.\n\n\u201c91 per cent of the mortalities are those not vaccinated. The remaining are people that have taken one dose are yet to complete their dose. Only 0.5 per cent of those that died are people that have taken two doses of the vaccine. So the booster dose provides better protection,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nIn a bid to attain the nation\u2019s first female president, a former Minister of Women Affairs, Iyom Josephine Anenih called on more Nigerian women to come out and be actively involved in partisan politics, noting that more female state governors should also emerge.\n\nAnenih made this call while delivering the lead paper on the theme, \u201cWomen in Leadership and Governance: Promoting Sustainable Economic Prosperity\u201d, at the 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony held in Lagos recently.\n\nShe asserted that Nigeria wouldn\u2019t attain the transformational changes desired by patriots until a female president emerges.\n\nWhile encouraging women to be more involved in politics, Anineh debunked claims that women lack funds to attain the presidency in the nation.\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-2\n\n\u201cThe truth is that women can\u2019t be in the homes or the other room and expect to become president. No, it\u2019s not by appointment. We are making money in the private sector, so it\u2019s time to invest it in politics. We have very rich women and the assertion that there is no money isn\u2019t true,\u201d Anineh said.\n\nShe noted that women are already actively involved in politics because there is no way women could be on corporate boards as directors without some element of politicking, adding that it is time for them to play politics at the big stage in political parties.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can have the leadership of this country without belonging to a political party. That is what our constitution says. There is no way Nigeria will appoint you President of Nigeria and no one will not appoint you Governor of your state. You have to come out and contest and you cannot contest unless you belong to a political party.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-3\n\n\u201cSo, women, come out, join any political party of your choice, use the power, your energy that you are using to excel in the private sector, in your businesses to excel and come on top in the political party, then you can have a say, then, you can have a ticket to contest, then, you can become a Governor, then, you can become a President.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, efforts to use legislative means to get more quotas for women would be less effective when compared to active participation by women.\n\nOn her part, the BoT Chairperson of MMS Women of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF)Initiative, Mrs. Margaret Orakwusi stated that attaining a female president in the country is the dream of the Initiative even as she lauded the Founder of the Initiative, Kingsley Anaroke for celebrating women for more than ten years.\n\nHer words: \u201cWell, the elections are around the corner and it\u2019s time for women. Somebody said in Nigeria, money plays a huge part, but my position is that we have money because we have husbands and we have sons. Money should not be a problem. We should come together, we should identify those women who will take this country to the higher level and we need to.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-4\n\n\u201cLook at what we are going through in this country, look at our children; drugs are taking over, wickedness, evil taking over. It is our responsibility because a bad child has a mother and as a mother, we are all mothers. So, please, we need to change the narrative, we need to key into Kingsley\u2019s dream and make it possible. Whatever it takes that women take over not just in politics, in commerce, and in everything, that we require to make this nation a great country.\u201d\n\nOrakwusi, however, noted that MMS WoFHoF has been promoting women in commerce, transport, and politics. \u201cIt is Kingsley\u2019s dream and I am sure I am right, to have a female President. He has always given us this beautiful platform to excel by identifying women who have done so much, who have excelled in their chosen profession not just in the maritime sector.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the occasion, Princess Dr. Vicky Haastrup observed that Nigerian women had the capacity to provide solutions to the nation\u2019s problems, stressing that male presidents have failed the country since its independence.\n\n\u201cWe have got to that point where Nigeria recognizes that men have failed us. Women should take over by becoming President, Governors, and everything possible. We are getting there by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nHaastrup who is also the Chairman, Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) commended Mrs. Josephine Anenih for supporting Mrs. Patience Jonathan amid calls for 30 percent women inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cThe moment women in Nigeria become Governors, become Senators, how many women senators do we have in Nigeria? How many of them are in the House of Reps.? Things must change, women in Nigeria, you must rise up to the occasion. You must empower yourselves, you must be ready. We are not going to fight but we will slug it out with men.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021\n\nA former Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs, ACG Charles Edike stressed that the recent trend which has seen more Nigerian women as Managing Directors of commercial banks and other multinationals could easily spill into politics with the emergence of the first Nigerian female president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the day Nigeria will have a female president. There are many of them around the world and most of them have been very successful. It\u2019s time to give women the space. If we create an enabling environment for a Nigerian female president, we would be amazed at the wonders God will do with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen are being celebrated today because they are achievers and we expect that this celebration will spur them to do better. This will also motivate others to be successful in their respective fields. Women have proven to be better managers of human and financial resources. Purpose-driven women always make judicious use of their resources and they multiply it. God created them like that.\u201d Edike said.\n\nThe Founder of the MMS WoFHoF Initiative, Mr. Kingsley Anaroke reiterated that men have failed Nigeria for several generations.\n\nHis words: \u201cCan we try women? There may have been cases of one or two disappointments within the female folk. However, when you place them side-by-side with men, we have had more men failures than women. I believe in a woman for the presidency. A woman can lead and let the men guide. What we have done here today is to mainstream women in leadership and governance. A woman who finds herself in a corrupting environment wouldn\u2019t be as corrupt as the men.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with MMS Plus on the sidelines, three of the 2021 inductees; the President of Women\u2019s International Shipping and Trading Association (WISTA) Nigeria, Mrs. Eunice Ezeoke, President of Jami\u2019yyan Matan Arewa (JMA), Hajia Rabi Musa Saulama, and a Governing Board Member of the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM), Dr. Mrs. Yetunde Akinluyi affirmed that the time is ripe to achieve a first female Nigerian president.\n\nThe 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony, which was held at the Golden Gate Hotel Ikoyi, was graced by top women in the nation\u2019s transport and finance sectors, as well as eminent female politicians, amongst other dignitaries.",

No, it\u2019s not by appointment. We are making money in the private sector, so it\u2019s time to invest it in politics. We have very rich women and the assertion that there is no money isn\u2019t true,\u201d Anineh said.\n\nShe noted that women are already actively involved in politics because there is no way women could be on corporate boards as directors without some element of politicking, adding that it is time for them to play politics at the big stage in political parties.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can have the leadership of this country without belonging to a political party. That is what our constitution says. There is no way Nigeria will appoint you President of Nigeria and no one will not appoint you Governor of your state. You have to come out and contest and you cannot contest unless you belong to a political party.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-3\n\n\u201cSo, women, come out, join any political party of your choice, use the power, your energy that you are using to excel in the private sector, in your businesses to excel and come on top in the political party, then you can have a say, then, you can have a ticket to contest, then, you can become a Governor, then, you can become a President.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, efforts to use legislative means to get more quotas for women would be less effective when compared to active participation by women.\n\nOn her part, the BoT Chairperson of MMS Women of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF)Initiative, Mrs. Margaret Orakwusi stated that attaining a female president in the country is the dream of the Initiative even as she lauded the Founder of the Initiative, Kingsley Anaroke for celebrating women for more than ten years.\n\nHer words: \u201cWell, the elections are around the corner and it\u2019s time for women. Somebody said in Nigeria, money plays a huge part, but my position is that we have money because we have husbands and we have sons. Money should not be a problem. We should come together, we should identify those women who will take this country to the higher level and we need to.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-4\n\n\u201cLook at what we are going through in this country, look at our children; drugs are taking over, wickedness, evil taking over. It is our responsibility because a bad child has a mother and as a mother, we are all mothers. So, please, we need to change the narrative, we need to key into Kingsley\u2019s dream and make it possible. Whatever it takes that women take over not just in politics, in commerce, and in everything, that we require to make this nation a great country.\u201d\n\nOrakwusi, however, noted that MMS WoFHoF has been promoting women in commerce, transport, and politics. \u201cIt is Kingsley\u2019s dream and I am sure I am right, to have a female President. He has always given us this beautiful platform to excel by identifying women who have done so much, who have excelled in their chosen profession not just in the maritime sector.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the occasion, Princess Dr. Vicky Haastrup observed that Nigerian women had the capacity to provide solutions to the nation\u2019s problems, stressing that male presidents have failed the country since its independence.\n\n\u201cWe have got to that point where Nigeria recognizes that men have failed us. Women should take over by becoming President, Governors, and everything possible. We are getting there by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nHaastrup who is also the Chairman, Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) commended Mrs. Josephine Anenih for supporting Mrs. Patience Jonathan amid calls for 30 percent women inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cThe moment women in Nigeria become Governors, become Senators, how many women senators do we have in Nigeria? How many of them are in the House of Reps.? Things must change, women in Nigeria, you must rise up to the occasion. You must empower yourselves, you must be ready. We are not going to fight but we will slug it out with men.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021\n\nA former Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs, ACG Charles Edike stressed that the recent trend which has seen more Nigerian women as Managing Directors of commercial banks and other multinationals could easily spill into politics with the emergence of the first Nigerian female president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the day Nigeria will have a female president. There are many of them around the world and most of them have been very successful. It\u2019s time to give women the space. If we create an enabling environment for a Nigerian female president, we would be amazed at the wonders God will do with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen are being celebrated today because they are achievers and we expect that this celebration will spur them to do better. This will also motivate others to be successful in their respective fields. Women have proven to be better managers of human and financial resources. Purpose-driven women always make judicious use of their resources and they multiply it. God created them like that.\u201d Edike said.\n\nThe Founder of the MMS WoFHoF Initiative, Mr. Kingsley Anaroke reiterated that men have failed Nigeria for several generations.\n\nHis words: \u201cCan we try women? There may have been cases of one or two disappointments within the female folk. However, when you place them side-by-side with men, we have had more men failures than women. I believe in a woman for the presidency. A woman can lead and let the men guide. What we have done here today is to mainstream women in leadership and governance. A woman who finds herself in a corrupting environment wouldn\u2019t be as corrupt as the men.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with MMS Plus on the sidelines, three of the 2021 inductees; the President of Women\u2019s International Shipping and Trading Association (WISTA) Nigeria, Mrs. Eunice Ezeoke, President of Jami\u2019yyan Matan Arewa (JMA), Hajia Rabi Musa Saulama, and a Governing Board Member of the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM), Dr. Mrs. Yetunde Akinluyi affirmed that the time is ripe to achieve a first female Nigerian president.\n\nThe 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony, which was held at the Golden Gate Hotel Ikoyi, was graced by top women in the nation\u2019s transport and finance sectors, as well as eminent female politicians, amongst other dignitaries.",

          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nAdedamola Adefolahun, professionally known as Fireboy DML, is no doubt having one of the best times of his most loved career.\n\nAfter a major breakthrough with his debut album Laughter, Tears and Goosebumps\u2019, in 2019, Fireboy kept up his prolific pace this year, with the launch of his latest hit single \u2018Peru\u2019, a song currently on the lips of the young and young at heart.\n\nThe singer and songwriter, who has a song for every feeling from love, breakup, happiness to travel, says the song \u2018Peru\u2019 basically recounts his journey and holiday fun in San Francisco.\n\nAs he takes on Lagos today, January 2nd for his first major headline concert tagged \u201cThe Fire Concert\u201d at the Balmoral, Federal Palace hotel Lagos, the English Language graduate of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, says he is optimistic about the future of the new year, with regards to satisfying fans.\n\nFireboy, who carted home the highest number of awards at the 2021 Headies, shares his excitement on the \u2018Fireboy Concert, his latest collaboration with British high-profile singer Ed Sheeran and influences while growing up, among others.\n\nYou are headlining your first concert ever in Lagos \u201cThe Fire Concert\u201d How does that make you feel?\n\nEcstatic and anxious! I can\u2019t wait for that night on the 2nd of January, 2022. I\u2019ll be performing many songs I\u2019ve never performed before so it\u2019s going to be super special.\n\nTell us about your latest album? What is the inspiration behind it?\n\nI made my sophomore album during the lockdown in 2020, with the sole purpose of giving my listeners a little peek into my life and personality. My debut was simply an introduction to my sound so I decided to make the next one a bit more personal and introspective.\n\nWhat is the inspiration behind your latest hit \u2018Peru\u2019, how did it come about?\n\nThere is no particular depth to it, to be honest. It was a drunken freestyle\u2014just a young man who had found himself in a foreign land and had decided to enjoy every single minute of his experience there. I was simply telling my truth in melody. I had just landed in San Francisco to pay a courtesy visit to my empire team in the studio. I met Shizzi there, told him to play me a beat and that was it. In 40 minutes, \u2018Peru\u2019 was born.\n\nAnd how would you describe the reception so far?\n\nAmazing! The song has gone on to become a global smash hit! Right now, it\u2019s my biggest song yet. I am super grateful to God, my team and to the fans, media houses, and every stakeholder of the afrobeat genre who made this possible.\n\nTell us about the remix with English singer Ed Sheeran, why Ed?\n\nWhen the team told me it was time to push Peru even further globally, I told them I wouldn\u2019t do a remix with just anybody, no matter how big they were. I\u2019m big on mutual respect and organic energy when it comes to collaborations, so I waited patiently till it came. When the opportunity presented itself, I knew Ed was the one for this song, because he genuinely loves the song and also because I have been a fan of his, for as long as I remember, so I connect with his sound. He made me fall in love with acoustic guitars, and then when we met and shot the video, the energy was amazing. I am super grateful to have him on this project.\n\nHow would you say your style has evolved since the beginning of your career?\n\nFor me, every album is a different era. LTG was the boyish lover boy who just wanted everyone to listen to his sound; APOLLO was the deep, reclusive guy in his introspective bag. This era is different. This is the guy who is more comfortable sonically, the guy who is out of his comfort zone, and more open to different possibilities. My next album will be my most commercial album yet.\n\nWho helped you most in your journey?\n\nOlamide, without a doubt, is a mentor and guide I can never replace. I am forever grateful to him.\n\nWhere and how do you get inspiration for your songs?\n\nFor me, there are no particular perimeters with music-making. As long as I can hear the sound and it\u2019s pleasing to me, inspiration and every other thing comes naturally, it just flows. I can\u2019t explain it.\n\nIs there a particular place where you feel most creative?\n\nAnywhere music plays. I like to constantly surround myself with music and anything that has to do with it keeps me in a constantly creative zone and headspace.\n\nDo you have any hobbies or interests outside of music?\n\nI love football a lot. I love playing and watching. Once a week, I play football with my friends, we even set up a sort of \u201cfootball club\u201d and yes, your guess is right, I am the captain of the team. I also love video games; it\u2019s one of those things I do to unwind. I don\u2019t like going out so it\u2019s mainly indoor activities I do to keep me relaxed. I love to read a lot, and occasionally I write poetry.\n\nWhat strengths do you have that you believe make you a great musician?\n\nSongwriting for sure, I think it\u2019s what sets me apart. I strongly believe that the ability to make music is more important than pure singing ability. Nothing beats being intentional with music-making, and no better way to make music than being an amazing songwriter.\n\nWhich famous musicians do you admire?\n\nI admire a lot of musicians for different reasons but three people stand out for me, and I consider them the foundation of my sound; Passenger, Jon Bellion, and Wande Coal. I admire them for the soul and honesty they bring into songwriting.\n\nWhat is the biggest problem you have encountered in the journey of music?\n\nThe complexity of human beings makes it so difficult to navigate this journey, but the passion and love I have for the craft makes it easy for me to overlook these things. We move, regardless.\n\nIf you could change one thing in the music industry in Nigeria, what would it be and Why?\n\nOur industry is beautiful at the moment, but I think we could do with a better structure. We are definitely getting there, we just need more time.\n\nDo you feel that you chose your \u201cpassion,\u201d or did it choose you?\n\nIt definitely chose me, because I thought my passion would be something else. In the middle of the chaos that was my life, music found me and I found purpose.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t chosen your field, what would your alternate field have been?\n\nProbably a professional footballer or a professional writer, it\u2019s a weird combo but it is what it is.\n\nWhat accomplishments do you see yourself achieving in the next five to 10 years?\n\nFor myself and for afrobeat, I see myself becoming a bigger and better proponent of the genre, performing on the biggest stages, and becoming a legend.\n\nIt\u2019s Christmas, what does Christmas mean to you and what\u2019s your wish this Xmas?\n\nEven as a kid I was always indoors, probably reading a book or something. But I always loved the atmosphere Christmas brings. There is some sort of peace and joy in the air that I can\u2019t explain and it\u2019s beautiful to see. Right now, I\u2019m all about spreading positive energy and bringing genuine smiles to the faces of my fans and family, with music and genuine affection. My Xmas wish is for this pandemic to completely go away.\n\nTell us your New Year resolutions for 2022 and your plans for the year?\n\nI have no resolutions. As for my plans, I have a lot! I\u2019m having my first headline concert in January, and doing my first USA tour in February. In the 2nd quarter, I will be in Europe touring. After that, I\u2019ll start working on releasing my third album. I\u2019m almost done with it at this moment.\n\nWhat is your motto or good advice you live by?\n\nGood things take time, great things take everything.\n\nTell us a bit about where you were born, your growing up, and how that impacted your career today?\n\nI was born and raised in Ogun state. I grew up in Abeokuta, with my parents and two brothers. As the firstborn, I was always the quiet and responsible one. I never went out or had too many friends and it has shaped me into this reclusive creative. I like it that way, it helps me focus and it keeps me away from a lot of energy I do not need.\n\nWhat is one message you would give to your fans?\n\nThank you for staying with me through this journey. I love you and I can\u2019t wait for you all to experience my next album. Stay masked up this period, and stay close to your loved ones.\n\nHave a happy New Year.",

But we inherited what you call DISCOS, they almost buried the country based on geopolitical zones. What was the basis? The people that own the DISCOS, who are they? They are not electrical engineers, they don\u2019t have money? Is just a political favour. We thought that was unnecessary. I told you now we have something. I\u2019m sure you know, what it used to be between Lagos and Ibadan alone not to talk about the rest of the country. But we\u2019ve got the Chinese to have the rail, to do the roads. How can we turn that down? So the Chinese are welcome. Anybody that is prepared to come and help with our infrastructure, I have told you the roads, the rail and power will be welcome.\u201d\n\nThe President explained his opposition to direct primaries: \u201cI want people to be given a choice. You can\u2019t give them one option, and you think that you are being democratic? Let them have the three options of direct, indirect and consensus.\n\nHe had just one word for the main opposition party: \u201cPDP failure.\u201d\n\nAsked to speak on the 2023 elections he said: 2023 is not my problem. I am not interested in who succeeds me. I don\u2019t have any favourite.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari declined to speak on his successor, when asked if he had a preference and would want to mention names. He said: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t because he will be eliminated if I mention it. I better keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nHe advised young people against depending on the government for jobs as he challenges them to also look in the direction of agriculture.\n\nAsked what legacy he will be leaving behind he said: \u201cMy legacy is that I have tried for us to conduct ourselves with integrity.

          "text": "From Isaac Anumihe, Abuja\n\nDrinkers of non-alcoholic drinks and carbonated products will have to pay a little more as the government has introduced\n\nN10 excise duty per litre of all non-alcoholic and sweetened beverages.\n\nThis is part of measures to shore up revenue and address the low taxation in the country.\n\nSpeaking during a public presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Act, yesterday, in Abuja, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, recalled that the new policy which is in the Finance Act was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 31, 2021.\n\nAccording to the minister, apart from increasing revenue, the policy will also discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages which contributes to a number of health conditions including diabetes and obesity.\n\nRecall that in 2017, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the revised National Tax Policy to increase Value Added Tax (VAT) on luxury items, like champagne, luxury cars, and other luxury goods.\n\nThe then Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun had said that while the implementation of the revised policy would take immediate effect, some aspects that required changes in law would be referred to the National Assembly for action.\n\nShe said that Nigeria was one of the countries with the lowest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) tax ratio in the world, adding that non-payment of tax was one of the biggest factors that contributed to the nation\u2019s current economic situation, hence the need for the revised policy.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIn implementing the new policy, Adeosun had said the government would attempt to reduce the number of taxes with emphasis on indirect taxes, as well as centralising tax administration where possible.\n\n\u201cWhat the committee has shown is that we should look at actually increasing VAT on some luxury items. With VAT of five per cent, we have the lowest VAT. While we don\u2019t think VAT should be increased on basic items, if you are going to drink champagne in the United Kingdom, the VAT is 20 per cent; so, why should it be five per cent in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cSo, they have made recommendations that we should pull out some luxury items and increase VAT on those items immediately. And I think that is a very valid and sensible suggestion, which we are going to talk to the National Assembly about to see how we can implement it.\n\n\u201cBut as far as basic goods are concerned, no. I believe it is only fair that when you consume luxury goods, you should pay a little bit more. The National Assembly will decide the percentage.\u201d Adeosun, said.\n\nThe minister said that the objectives of the revised policy included to guide the operation and review of the tax system; provide the basis for future tax legislation and administration; provide clarity on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders; and standard benchmark on which they would be held accountable.\n\nAlso, while unveiling its austerity measures, the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan had in 2014, identified some items that were to be taxed as luxury goods to include champagne, alcoholic beverages, private jets, luxury cars based on engine capacity, and yachts.\n\nIt had estimated to generate about N480 billion from taxes on luxury items in the 2015 fiscal period",

Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cFrom available facts in the duplicate case file, the investigation carried out by the police did not reveal that any secret society name, tattoo or insignia of any unlawful society was found in the possession of any of the suspects during the investigation carried out by the police.\n\n\u201cTo hold otherwise would amount to sniffing for an offence and a speculative act which is not permitted in law. It is trite law that suspicion no matter how grave cannot be a ground for conviction, \u201d the report stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the report cleared the college and five employees; Celina Uduak, Valentine Igboekweze, Hammed Ayomo Bariyu, Adesanya Olusesan Olusegun and one Adeyemi of the offence of negligent act causing harm contrary to section 252 of the Criminal Law Ch. C17, Vol.3, Laws of Lagos State 2015.\n\nBased on the conclusion of the report, the DPP, directed that the students and staff be released if they are still in custody.\n\nThe 12-year-old JSS 2 student of the college died November 28th, 2021 at a hospital in Warri, Delta State.\n\nFollowing his death, the Lagos State Government immediately shut the school to allow for investigation while some parents staged protest and organized Candle light procession for the late Sylvester Oromoni.\n\nHis death generated ripples prompting the Lagos State Police Command to arrest five students and five staff of the college.\n\nThe release of the DPP report is coming less than 24 hours after Daily Sun reporter asked the Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefiayo, during the tour of schools on Tuesday, the fate of the college with resumption of 2021/2022 academic session in the state.\n\nAdefiayo said the state government is awaiting the report of the investigation into the death of the pupil.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, should defend himself in court for peddling false information about his regime while he (Kanu) was overseas.\n\nBuhari stated this in an interview aired on Channels Television on Wednesday night which was monitored by SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\nThere have been pressures on Buhari to release Kanu including a recent visit by some Igbo elders led by Minister of Aviation in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi.\n\nDuring the visit on November 19, 2021, Buhari had told them he would not want to interfere in the running of the judiciary but said he would consider their demand though \u201ca heavy one.\u201d\n\nBut speaking on Wednesday night during the television interview, the President said, \u201cThere is one institution that I wouldn\u2019t interfere with, that is judiciary, Kanu\u2019s case is with the judiciary but what I wonder is when Kanu was safely in Europe, abusing this administration and mentioning too many things, I thought he wants to come and defend himself on the accusations.\n\n\u201cSo, we are giving him an opportunity to defend himself in our system, not to be abusing us from Europe as if he was not a Nigerian.

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Cars45, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The Nation reports that the company has met the six conditions imposed by the Nigerian government.\n\nTo refresh your memory, here are the conditions that the Federal government insisted on: an office in Nigeria, a country representative, payment of fair taxes, register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)/get a license from the National Broadcasting Commission, sensitivity to national security and cohesion, and train Nigerian IT personnel and strategic intelligence officers on how to report Twitter abuse/infractions noticed by the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a source quoted by The Nation, Twitter\u2019s hesitance to open an office in Nigeria last year stemmed from it not being part of its 2021 budget. The source also expressed optimism that as the new year rolls out, the company will open an office.\n\nWhile it sounds like good news, this raises a few concerns. The first is that going by the report, Twitter is being coerced into opening an office in Nigeria. Ideally, this should create jobs and government revenue but could ensure government control over the microblogging site.\n\nAppointing a country representative also enables the government to hold someone accountable whenever they believe that Twitter has infringed on some of its laws.\n\nThis is the second time that reports have suggested that the ban could be lifted, and Nigerians would hope that things play out differently this time. However, owing to Twitter\u2019s silence on negotiations, it could be that it takes some time before the ban is lifted.\n\nGahez raises $2 million in pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgyptian eCommerce startup, Gahez, has raised $2 million in pre-seed funding. Disruptech Ventures led the round with Egypt Ventures, Tanmeyah, Afropreneur fund, and other angel investors participating.\n\nLaunched last year, the startup joins a slew of B2B eCommerce startups trying to digitise operations for Africa\u2019s merchants and manufacturers. Having worked with over 15,000 merchants and 142 manufacturers since its launch, the startup plans to use this fresh injection of capital to build its technology and recruit more staff.\n\nCo-founder and CEO, Wael Olama, in a statement, said, \u201cWe are on a mission to revolutionise the way retailers shop for their stores by relieving the stress of managing and sourcing. We believe that the Egyptian/African apparel market is untapped and widely fragmented, which provides Gahez with the perfect opportunity (relying on technology) to scale and position itself within the sphere.\u201d\n\nFedaPay secures funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeninese startup, FedaPay, has announced a first round of investment from the Benin Business Angel Network (BBAN).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2018, FedaPay provides merchants with an efficient and secure payment system, enabling them to receive payments using cards and mobile money. Although the startup was founded in Benin, it has recently launched its services in neighbouring Niger.\n\nIn a statement, FedaPay\u2019s technical team lead and co-founder, Boris Koumondji, said, \u201cFedaPay is better than its Beninese competitors because it distinguishes itself by offering customised and flexible pricing that corresponds with its merchants\u2019 business models.\n\n\u201cFedaPay\u2019s payment method coverage allows them to take payments from customers via mobile money and bank cards in a single integration.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi, here.\n\nIt seems 2020, the year of the coronavirus, is looking to become a trilogy. For the third year running, people are living through different levels of lockdowns and increasing cases of COVID-19 and its variants. On the last day of 2021, Israel reportedly recorded a double infection of influenza and coronavirus \u2014 Florona \u2014 in a pregnant patient.\n\nAlthough this is not a variant of the virus like Delta and Omicron, experts can\u2019t say how severe a combination of this kind could be. Some countries are still reconsidering lifting lockdowns, while others have experienced more than three waves of the pandemic already. I\u2019m tempted to ask, \u201cwhen does all this end?\u201d So, this is another reminder for you to stay safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a lot happened in the last year; apart from Crypto Explorer \u2014 Emmanuel mentioned this yesterday \u2014 there are some interesting topical discourses/series we introduced/re-introduced in 2021 that I want to remind you of (I promise, this has nothing to do with COVID-19). But, before that, let\u2019s do a quick one on what happened to a once-upon-a-time sweetheart of the smartphone industry.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nBlackberry\u2019s demise\n\nThe Expert series\n\nLiving with learning disabilities\n\nRIP Blackberry devices, for reals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 4, 2022, devices using the Blackberry OS will be unable to make or receive calls (including emergency numbers like 911), send or receive texts, use mobile data or Wi-Fi. However, this does not affect Blackberry devices running on Android OS.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming. A steady decline in market acceptance has been noticed since 2013. The company stopped manufacturing its own phones in 2016 and began outsourcing to other hardware partner companies. In 2021, it gave prior notice about this discontinuation.\n\nNot exactly a complete death: Blackberry continues to run as a cybersecurity company. It pivoted to this enterprise in 2016. So, we could call this the end of an era.\n\nLooks familiar? Blackberry abandoning its mobile phone OS venture reminds me of the abrupt death of Windows phones in 2016 after running for six years. Half the time, experts predicted that it was bound to fail.\n\nSome quarters blamed the demise on the fact that Microsoft couldn\u2019t stand the market dominance of Google\u2019s Android OS and Apple\u2019s iOS. Others faulted its rigidity in adapting third-party apps, among other deficiencies.\n\nAlso, recall that Nokia and Motorola shared a similar fate, although the former was more shocking. Do you have a history with Blackberry? Please tell me about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2022 gets even better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we re-introduced The Experts series to our readers. It features the lives and exploits of African tech specialists across the world. So far, I\u2019ve picked the brains of the genius personality who, along with his team, built Interswitch\u2019s Quickteller, Wale Abba; talked to Rachael Akalia, one human that embodies the brand called Patricia Technologies, a Nigerian-founded Estonia-based alternative currencies startup.\n\nSubsequently, during a virtual chat, I got Mopewa Ogundipe to talk about her profession and journey to becoming the software engineer behind Clubhouse\u2019s long-awaited Android app; Nigerian-American, Abake Adenle also opened up about moving from a successful career in the UK\u2019s investment banking space to becoming an entrepreneur running a startup building a voice recognition and speech synthesis software for five African languages.\n\nThe last editions for 2021 featured famous music artist and tech investor, Mr Eazi, and the leader of open banking in Nigeria, Adedeji Olowe, who demystified the concept of open banking while talking about his life.\n\nAlong the line, Kudi\u2019s Product Manager, Nifemi Akinwamide, opened our eyes to what it looks like to navigate a learning disability to become successful.\n\nThis year, look out for new editions that promise to be even more exciting and instructive. Subscribe to get notified.\n\nHow much do you know about learning deficiencies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms like dyslexia, dysgraphia, ADHD, and dyscalculia are rarely discussed within the Africa context, even for people living with the conditions. In 2020, our reporter, Victoria Fakiya, did in-depth reflections on these disabilities and discussed assistive technologies that can make life easier for people living with them. Click on the hyperlinks to catch up.\n\nMeanwhile, Precious Mogoli and Ogheneruemu Oneyibo also had interesting takes. Check them out here: Technology is awesome, but it\u2019s yet to conquer stuttering\n\nAnd here: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nTesla stock jumps after reporting record vehicle deliveries for 2021.

Yes, we\u2019re grateful for the respite of the public holiday, but you\u2019re probably working yourself into that mental space to resume work for the year.\n\nSince 2015, every New Year has seen Techpoint celebrate its birthday. On January 1, 2022, Techpoint turned 7, and we\u2019re entering the next frontier. Check out what that means in our Chief Servant, Muyiwa Matuluko\u2019s new year address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Africa is 7! The next frontier\n\nWhat I\u2019m discussing\n\nA momentous 2021\n\nSignificant regulatory moves to watch closely\n\nIndustry trends for 2022\n\nA momentous 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was an incredible year for Africa\u2019s tech space in 2021, which saw five startups publicly disclose their valuations as unicorns. Led by Flutterwave in March 2021, OPay, Wave, Andela, and Chipper Cash joined the enviable ranks of companies worth over a billion dollars.\n\nThe acquisition of Funke-Opeke led MainOne by Equinix for $320 million remains one of the standout moments. Don\u2019t forget Nigeria\u2019s shocking 2021.\n\nWe did a roundup of the memorable moments of 2021. Check it out here.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the industry that stood out heads, shoulders, and knees above the pack was the fintech space. Nigerian fintechs, for example, raised almost $800 million in 2021, gulped up 76% of funding for the year.\n\nBut the real impact of fintech is not in the funding numbers, and in the last year, we saw some intriguing moves in agency banking, telco led mobile money, and e-transactions.\n\nGuided by the expert opinion of Adedeji Olowe, Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria, we reviewed Nigerian fintech in the year 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReviewing Nigerian fintech in 2021: Local investors are stepping up\n\nAre you interested in projections for the new year? Kindly keep reading.\n\nPolicies I\u2019m watching out for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana debating e-payment levies\n\nOn December 21, 2021, Ghana\u2019s parliament turned into a legitimate battleground as lawmakers debated a proposal to introduce a 1.75% levy on all e-payment transactions. This would include mobile money transactions.\n\nThose in support are eyeing dividends of up to $1.15 billion that the country would gain in 2022 if its tax net widens to include e-payments.\n\nThose against the bill insist that it wouldn\u2019t be fair on low-income earners and people outside the formal banking sector, who heavily rely on mobile money.\n\nContext: In recent years, mobile money adoption in Ghana has been growing in leaps and bounds to rival Kenya\u2019s success story. A levy on mobile money transactions would improve taxation revenues, but there\u2019s no telling how it would impact the average mobile money user.\n\nThe parliament will meet on January 18, 2022, to cast the final votes, so that\u2019s a space worth watching.\n\nKenya signs law on digital lending\n\nWith banks reluctant to give loans, Africa has seen the rise of several digital lenders who have filled this gap. However, there\u2019s been a few controversies regarding unethical and predatory lending practices.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the Kenyan government has been implementing policies to stem these predatory practices. On December 7, 2021, the Kenyan parliament amended the Central Bank Act, 2021, giving the Central Bank of Kenya the authority to regulate digital credit lenders and limit unfair and discriminatory lending practices.\n\nGiven how vital lending is (more on that in a bit), I think this is a policy worth watching, and we can track important metrics like micro-lending activities. Read more.\n\nFunding Nigerian digital and creative companies\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a $170 million loan to fund the Nigerian Federal Government\u2019s i-DICE (investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises) program.\n\nThe government plans to use this initiative to fund 226 technology and creative startups and provide non-financial services to 451 digital technology and small and medium enterprises.\n\nNigeria\u2019s policy space has been fraught with lots of bad news, but I thought I should bring up what seems like good news.\n\nThe problem is, we\u2019ve seen several initiatives like this, and I\u2019ve been dismissive of them, but I think I should pay closer attention to announcements like these.\n\nYes, we\u2019ll look at past promises of such nature too, and if time permits, we can also include the one about lifting Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban \u201csoon\u201d.\n\nThe CBN\n\nI\u2019m not saying the Central Bank of Nigeria is a policy to watch out for; I\u2019m simply saying we should pay them close attention. Whatever the apex bank decides tomorrow could heavily affect Nigeria\u2019s fintech space.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\nThankfully, the Nigerian Federal Executive Council has okayed the startup bill, and it has been sent to the National Assembly. If passed, this bill is touted as one of the most important legislation for Nigeria\u2019s tech space.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has a stellar history of passing great business laws, but implementing them has been another issue. Can we see a change in 2022? Does Nigeria need a startup act? Where are the clouds and silver linings?\n\nHere\u2019s my analysis on this subject. Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nSome projections for 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet is the lifeblood of the world\u2019s biggest companies today, so imagine my surprise in 2021 when I discovered the term Web3.\n\nThe Internet has evolved from different stages, with the original invention being called web 1, our current era is web2, and the future evolution will be Blockchain-powered Web3.\n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no industry trend without the Internet, so what happens to all the companies we know and appreciate if the Internet is changing? What does this evolution mean, and how does it affect me? We had some answers in the last crypto explorer of 2021.\n\nWeb3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond\n\nSurprise: Cloudfare says TIKTOK is now the most visited site in the world. Really? Not Google?\n\nWell, now is probably a good time to secure your child\u2019s online activities.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Web2? In 2021, several startups raised money to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector, undoubtedly the largest employer of labour on the continent and its most significant economic contributor.\n\nAs a result, these startups could experience closer scrutiny in 2022, with great expectations on their shoulders; it promises to be an exciting ride.\n\nAnother company that will be sure to make the headlines is Jumia. Long before the new wave of startups, Jumia dealt with African SMEs, and its struggles are well documented. Could we see a change in 2022?\n\nFintech ride: In 2021, Nigeria processed 3 billion electronic transactions valued at $588 billion. Source: I nor fit lie f\u2026 sorry.. NIBSS.\n\nI\u2019m making it one of my projects in 2022 to find out what all those transactions are. My best guess is cash, but is that the whole story?\n\nAlso, in 2021, Nigerian fintech, Piggyvest, said it disbursed $587.5 million to 3.5 million customers.\n\nMeanwhile, Olowe has again made some exciting predictions for Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\nSeveral predictions from last year, like WhatsApp\u2019s payment play and Visa and MasterCard\u2019s acquisition of Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively, have also featured in 2022.\n\nHighlights\n\nP2P FX to power investment apps\n\nNIN dethrones BVN\n\nTransfers become free.\n\nWe\u2019ll do a review this week, but you can check out his predictions here in the meantime\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nWishing you a Happy New Year!\n\nEmmanuel Paul for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policy analysis is my daily bread. Looking to chat?

          "summary": "Unsurprisingly, the industry that stood out heads, shoulders, and knees above the pack was the fintech space.\nContext: In recent years, mobile money adoption in Ghana has been growing in leaps and bounds to rival Kenya\u2019s success story.\nA levy on mobile money transactions would improve taxation revenues, but there\u2019s no telling how it would impact the average mobile money user.\nWhatever the apex bank decides tomorrow could heavily affect Nigeria\u2019s fintech space.\nAlso, in 2021, Nigerian fintech, Piggyvest, said it disbursed $587.5 million to 3.5 million customers.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u201cMy people perish for lack of knowledge\u201d says HOSEA.\n\nAs a journalist, writer and social scientist I have interacted with hundreds of politicians, public office seekers, academics, civil servants, clerics, critics and scores of other individuals in Edo State. My discovery is that only a few of them keep records of Edo Government activities. Hence, majority of them don\u2019t have accurate, compact information, knowledge and data base for undertaking proper analysis as well as critique of any government in office.\n\nFollowing this development, I resolved to start documenting all Edo State Governments in power since 2007 for public consumption beginning with Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole whose administration oversaw the affairs of Edo State from 2007-2016.\n\nMaterials used for government documentation are from on/offline sources, most especially reports carried in the state-owned Nigerian Observer published by Bendel Newspapers Company Limited with headquarters in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Expectedly, a reader of the documentation is provided with an authenticated, correct platform for assessing the policies programmes and projects of government; as well as the reasons, emotions and behavioural idiosyncrasies behind all government actions.\n\nGovernor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki assumed office as Edo State Governor on November 12, 2016. His administration is currently being documented and the exercise has resulted in these momumental works below.\n\n1.How Obaseki Became Governor In 2016\n\nThe work chronicles the hard road to the victories of Obaseki in the gubernatorial election of 2016 and in the law courts. It is a political biography of sorts that details his pains and triumphs enroute to the Governments House, Benin for his first tenure.\n\n2.Diary of Obaseki Administration first year in office. (November 12, 2016-November 11, 2017)\n\nThe work is a dossier on Obaseki\u2019s activities from November 12, 2016 to November 11, 2017 of his first tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\n3.Comprehensive Promises of Governor Godwin Obaseki to Edo People (December 1, 2015-Nove 12, 2019)\n\nThis is a compilation of all the promises that Obaseki made to the people of Edo State during the early period of his electioneering campaign in December 2015 up to November 2019, a year to completing his first tenure in office. Through this work, you gain insight into the performance index of the Obaseki administration as at 2020 when his first tenure ended using the promises he made as measuring benchmarks.\n\n4.PUBLIC CRITIQUE OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 \u2013 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nIn this work, you will be able to read the observations made by the critical segment of Edo people who perceive some imperfections in the administration\u2019s first tenure. The criticisms are presented in first and third-person narratives for identity confidentiality. The term \u201ccritique\u201d is used in the cover of the work to show no malice is intended in writing it. After all, all mortals on earth and institutions have their high and low points. Only God is perfect, does not err and is omniscient.\n\n5.OBASEKI: THREE YEARS ON THE SADDLE (NOVEMBER 12, 2016- NOVEMBER 11, 2019)\n\nIt contains the activities of Obaseki in the three years of his first tenure in office as Governor of Edo State. Obaseki relied on his performance during this period as a launch pad for his re-election September 19, 2020.\n\n6.FIRST TENURE: CONSOLIDATED DIARY OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nThis is a compendium of all the plans, programmes and projects either executed or proposed by the administration of Obaseki during the four years of his first, concluded tenure as Governor on November 11, 2020.\n\n7.MILESTONES OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a body of work which highlights the official accomplishments of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies under Obaseki during the first year of his second tenure in office as Governor.\n\n8.SECOND TENURE: FIRST \u2013 YEAR HARVEST OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a detailed summary of the activities of Obaseki Government that is self-sufficient in facts and information arranged in chronological sequence of occurrence. When you read through this work, you are educated about all that the administration did in the first year of its second tenure.\n\n9.Proposed Plans, Programmes And Projects Of Obaseki Administration (2021 Edition)\n\nThe work lists 68 items on the shelf of Obaseki government that are ongoing or awaiting execution as at the last quarter of 2021.\n\nLast Work: All these works are apolitical. Therefore, they are not sponsored by any individual, group or political party. Rather, the works were put together by a team of researchers who believe passionately in providing resources material with which Edo citizens and other interested persons can get relevant facts about Edo State Government.\n\nMICHAEL A.

This is the time to organise and not agonise. The politicians, particularly the conventional politicians, have been organising and positioning themselves since 2020.\n\n\u201cThe time to organise ourselves is now and we have to do it or we will be worse off again and the agony will be very grave.\n\n\u201cWe will not talk about the economy and security now which does not need rocket science to solve, despite being an oil-producing country, we are not enjoying this God-given resource, this is akin to the child of a meat seller having bone as meat.\n\n\u201cWe will be engaging you from time to time in the next few weeks on how to go about this journey of getting it right this time around, as we start the official count down to the elections coming up in February 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "Some retired military personnel, on Wednesday, stormed the headquarters of the Federal Ministry of Finance in Abuja to demand the immediate payment of their pension arrears.\n\nThe retirees under the aegis of Coalition for Concerned Veterans accused the federal government of owing them 24-month arrears of the approved minimum wage for military veterans, debarment allowance, among others.\n\nThe leader of the group, Abiodun Durowaiye-Herberts, said they had embarked on the protest as a result of the untold hardship and clear neglect of members by the authorities.\n\nHe lamented that despite serving the country with all their might to ensure the country remains united, peaceful and free, they are being subjected to such treatment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDurowaiye-Herberts vowed that they would continue with the protest until their demands are met.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman, Military Pensions Board, Commodore S.A. Lawal, has however assured pensioners that funds for payment of the 24 months minimum wage pension arrears to military pensioners was included in the Board\u2019s year 2022 budget.\n\nCommodore Lawal disclosed this while reacting to series of protests by members of some military veteran groups.\n\nHe said though the protests have remained peaceful, the Board wished to appeal to its esteemed pensioners to desist from any further agitation as their demands are being addressed by relevant government agencies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur esteemed military retirees would recall that in May 2021 the MPB notified them through a press release of my discussions with the Federal Ministry of Finance Budget and National Planning (FMFBNP) with regards to payment of all outstanding entitlements of military retirees as a result of the consequential adjustments on pensions occasioned by the New Minimum Wage Act, 2019.\n\n\u201cMy engagements with the Ministry paid off in June 2021 as funds were released to the Board for payment of shortfalls in gratuities of military retirees who retired/discharged from the Services between 18 April 2019 and 30 April 2021 as well as the implementation of the new pensions pay chart.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the shortfall in gratuities to deserving retired/discharged personnel were paid in July 2021, while all active retirees were placed on their new pension pay scale WEF May 2021 as directed by the President and Commander -in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is in this light that I wish to inform our esteemed retirees that the funds for payment of the 24 months minimum wage pension arrears to military pensioners is included in the Board\u2019s year 2022 budget estimates, currently under consideration at the National Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he informed retirees that the Board\u2019s year 2022 budget estimates have been successfully defended before relevant committees of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I would like to seize this opportunity to inform and assure all our esteemed pensioners that once the year 2022 budget is passed and assented to by Mr President, payments of the outstanding 24 months minimum wage pension arrears will commence.\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCommodore Lawal assured military retirees, Next of Kins (NOKs) and other well-meaning Nigerians that the Board remains resolute and will sustain the prompt payment of all entitlements due to military retirees or their NOKs.\n\nHe, therefore, urged them to continue to show understanding and patience and not to embark on any form of public protests or demonstrations as the issues at stake are receiving due attention.\n\nHe admonished that in the face of the current security situation in the country and the spread of a new variant of COVID-19 virus, gatherings of any sort in the name of protest of any kind should be discouraged by military pensioners and other stakeholders in the administration of military pensions.\n\nThe spokesperson of the group, Oamien Okhidievbie, said efforts to ensure their demands are met were rebuffed by the authorities.\n\nHe said, \u201cwe have had a series of meetings with the ministry of defense and every other party concerned, we were even supposed to have the protest before the ENDSARS.\n\n\u201cWe shelved it based on the assurance we received up till today that our demands have not been met. Come January 15 we are going to picket the ministry of finance and Defence should our entitlement be delayed further.\n\n\u201cHow can you not pay a debarment allowance, this is an allowance that discourages a soldier from using his skills against the country. I was in the special forces, I can create bombs , I can snip among others because of discipline I have decided not to use these skills against the country.\n\n\u201cLooking at the Health allowance is just a charade , it only takes care of malaria. I lost my sight while serving in the military. To manage myself I needed medication. A lot of retired personnel are ramshackled by health challenges.\n\n\u201cThe medically burdened veterans, their monies were slashed and no medical procedure for them to be treated and you\u2019re now depriving them from any kind of benefits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also 24 months of arrears,we have also been following up on. How can you make minimum wage. We are ashamed that we have military veterans in the helm of affairs in the country and this is happening to us.This is going to cascade down to demoralizing the fighting troops.\u201d\n\nReceiving the veterans, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Aliyu Ahmed, assured them that their arrears would be paid.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe payment you are referring to is quite heavy. There was no way it could have been paid in 2021, so what we have done is to include it in the 2022 budget, the military pension board is aware that it is in the budget. I want to reassure you that as the custodian of the budget as soon as we settle in and start issuing the warrant you would get your money.\u201c",

C17, Vol. 3, Laws of Lagos State 2015.\n\nThe DPP argued that the 10 suspects were not guilty for the boy\u2019s death in a document comprising legal advice to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, State Criminal Investigation Department, SCID, and the trial magistrate, Magistrate Olatunbosun Adeola.\n\nThe case of Oromoni junior was not murdered, nor was the student poisoned, according to the recommendation issued by Adetutu Oshinusi.\n\nThe interim and final autopsy reports issued by the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, as well as the toxicology report of postMortem samples and that of the Central Hospital, Warri, all agreed on the cause of death, which was Septicaemia, Lobar Pneumonia with Acute Pyelonephritis, Pyomyositis of the right ankle, and Acute Bacteria Pneumonia due to severe Sepsis, according to the advice.\n\nThe toxicology results were likewise not indicative of any harmful or poisonous chemical in the deceased\u2019s body, according to the DPP recommendation.\n\nAs a result of these facts, the DPP\u2019s legal opinion decided that there is no prima facie evidence of murder, involuntary manslaughter, or maliciously giving poison with the intent to hurt against the five pupils.\n\n\u201cFrom available facts in the duplicate case file, the investigation carried out by the Police did not reveal that any secret society name, tattoo or insignia of any unlawful society was found in the possession of any of the suspects during the investigation carried out by the Police.\n\n\u201cTo hold otherwise would amount to sniffing for an offence and a speculative act which is not permitted in law. It is trite law that suspicion no matter how grave cannot be a ground for conviction\u201d.\n\nThe state, therefore, directed that all the suspects should be released if they were still in the custody of the law enforcement agency in the state, according to the document obtained by Channels.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ruled out the option of pardoning the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAlthough he acknowledges the possibility of a political resolution, he believes the IPOB leader must answer for his actions over the years, especially while he was out of the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians know that I don\u2019t interfere with the judiciary,\u201d the President told Channels Television in an exclusive interview that aired on Wednesday. \u201cLet him be listened to. For those who are saying that we should release him, no we cannot release him.\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility of political solution; if people behave themselves, all well and good, but you can\u2019t go to a foreign country and keep on sending incorrect economic and security problem against your country and thinking that you will never have to account for what you have been doing. Let him account for what he has been doing.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Chinese Loans: Anybody That Will Help Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Is Welcome \u2013 Buhari\n\nIn November last year, President Buhari had promised to consider the request of some leaders from the South East region to release Kanu who is facing treason charges preferred against him by the Nigerian Government.\n\nAlthough he told the Igbo leaders under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats that they had made an extremely difficult demand, he insisted that the best thing was to subject the IPOB leader to the judicial system.\n\nIn his interview with Channels Television, the President doubted if Kanu was willing to return to the country to clear his name from the allegations against him after he fled in 2017.\n\n\u201cThere is one institution that I wouldn\u2019t dare interfere with \u2013 that is the judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cKanu\u2019s case is with the judiciary, but what I wonder is when Kanu was safely in Europe abusing this administration and mentioning too many things, I never thought really he wants to voluntarily come and defend himself on the accusations.\n\n\u201cSo, we are giving him an opportunity to defend himself in our system, not to be abusing us from Europe as if he was not a Nigerian. Let him come here to us and then criticise us here.\u201d\n\nImproved Security?\n\nApart from the trial of the IPOB leader, the President also spoke about a number of burning issues including security, economy, and politics, among others.\n\nHe began his interview with an assessment of his administration\u2019s performance since he assumed office in 2015, especially in the three key areas of security, improving the economy, and fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cFor Nigerians to be fair with this administration is to try and find out from the time we won the election in 2015 till now, in the three promises we made \u2013 improving security, improving the economy, and trying to fight corruption; securing the country in the North East, if you ask anybody from Borno State, from Yobe State, from Adamawa State, there are a number of local governments \u2013 about 18 \u2013 that were in the hands of Boko Haram, no local government now is strictly in the hands of Boko Haram or ISWAP. So, in that respect, we have done something,\u201d President Buhari asserted.\n\n\u201cIn the economy, don\u2019t forget and I challenge so many people to go and check with the central bank or NNPC. The production from 1999 to 2014 was 2.1 million barrels per day. When we came, somehow the militants were unleashed in the South South.\n\n\u201cProduction went down to half a million barrels per day, and coincidentally, the price again collapsed to about $37 per barrel. But look at what we did within the time frame and the resources available to us relative to the government we inherited.\u201d\n\nDespite the gains made so far in improving the economy, the President is not happy with the present state of power because no country can develop without infrastructure, and infrastructure, for him, means road, rail, and power.\n\nHe, however, gave an assurance that his administration was working hard to bridge the gap, although the privatisation of the sector was another problem to worry about.\n\nChinese Loans\n\nPresident Buhari lamented that the owners of the distribution companies bought them based on geo-political zones rather than merit, stressing that removing a system and reintroducing one was no joke.\n\nHe went on to defend his government\u2019s decision to source loans from China, saying anyone willing to help Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure was welcome.\n\n\u201cWe take that (loans) where it is necessary \u2026 we got the Chinese to help us in the rail and the roads, how can we turn that down? If we had turned that down maybe between Lagos to Ibadan, you will have to walk,\u201d the President said.\n\n\u201cSo, the Chinese are welcome, anybody that is prepared to come and help us and our infrastructure to do the roads, the rail, and power will be welcomed.\u201d\n\nIn the area of education, President Buhari told Nigerian youths to use their exposure to improve themselves and not see them as tickets to depend on the government.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish when they go to school when they work hard when they earn their degree; they don\u2019t do it thinking that government must give them jobs. You get educated because an educated person is certainly better than an uneducated person, even in identifying personal problems.\n\n\u201cSo, education is not just meant to hang on to the government to give you jobs and then what the colonialists indoctrinated in us to believe \u2013 have a car, have a house, start work by 8:00 am, and close by 2 pm.\u201d\n\nThe President also shared his political view where he said he was ready to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, if the National Assembly would include the options of consensus candidate and indirect primary to the mode of selecting a candidate for an election, as against the initial direct mode as the only option to conduct primaries by political parties.\n\nAsked if he will sign the bill if the lawmakers effect the change in that direction, he affirmed, \u201cYes, I will! I will sign.\n\n\u201cThere should be options, you can\u2019t dictate to people and say you are doing democracy. Give them other options so they can make a choice.\u201d",

Give them other options so they can make a choice.\u201d\n\n\u2018Why They Lost\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari had withheld his assent to the bill, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political actors as part of the reasons for his decision.\n\nIn their reaction, lawmakers in the House of Representatives could not immediately take an action but they said they would adequately address the matter in January.\n\nDuring a plenary in December, Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, had explained that the time was short to address such a sensitive issue.\n\nAt the upper chamber, the Senate also resolved to consult with the House of Representatives in January when both chambers would be in session.\n\nWhile the lawmakers have yet to resume from recess or deliberate on the bill, President Buhari said it was wrong to force an option on the people.\n\nStressing the importance of allowing people to choose from available options, he relived the events that led to his election into office and ended the 16 years rule of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I do not support direct primary because I want people to be given a choice,\u201d the President stated. \u201cYou can\u2019t give them one option and think that you are being democratic. Let them have three options \u2013 there is the consensus.\n\n\u201cPDP was so overconfident that they thought they would rule Nigeria till the end of time, but the opposition (parties) came together, and we overthrew them. Not as a result of direct primary, it is as a result of opposition parties coming together and fighting the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is because we agreed to come together. The fact that we came together gave us the success we had, and that was the mistake they made; that is why they lost.\u201d",

The AGF said his office will be gazetting the court order in a few days.\n\nIn a related development, reactions have trailed the killing of two notorious bandits Alhaji Auta and Kachalla Luga in Zamfara State.\n\nThe bandits were said to have been responsible for the abduction of many residents in the state.\n\nSocio-political organisation, the Arewa Consultative Forum on Monday, hailed the officers of the Nigerian Air Force that carried out the aerial bombardment of the bandit hideouts which neutralised the duo and many of their followers.",

          "title": "UK Travel Firms Call for Removal of Covid Testing Rules",
          "text": "Travel industry groups have called for all remaining Covid restrictions on travellers to be removed in the latest government review.\n\nWith data last week suggesting one in 25 people in the UK currently had the virus, airlines say passenger testing is having no real impact.\n\nThe government said it continued to \u201ckeep all measures under review\u201d.\n\nThe travel industry said compulsory testing for UK arrivals and departures had held back the sector\u2019s recovery.\n\nThe prime minister will meet his cabinet later and urge them to back his decision not to impose any further Covid restrictions in England.\n\nOn Tuesday, Boris Johnson said he hoped the country could \u201cride out\u201d the current wave, although he acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed.\n\nCurrently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK.\n\nThey then have to take another test \u2013 which this time must be a PCR test \u2013 within the first two days after their arrival in the UK.\n\nBut at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 \u2013 and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid.\n\nBut now, the UK has announced more than 200,000 new cases in a day for the first time in the entire pandemic and Omicron is the dominant variant \u2013 so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to \u201ckeep out Omicron\u201d.\n\nThe only other countries in the world that have topped 200,000 positive tests in a single day this week have been the US and France.\n\nThe trade body Airlines UK argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry. It added that the current limits have depressed demand and dented consumer confidence.\n\nManchester Airports Group (MAG) has sent the government research it commissioned, which it claims shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron.\n\nIt said that passenger numbers at MAG\u2019s airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced.\n\nTim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme the research showed there was a \u201cbasis for taking out all tests\u201d related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn\u2019t be doing it and we should take those measures out,\u201d he added.\n\nLast month, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that \u201cvery soon\u201d, if Omicron became the dominant variant, there would be \u201cless need to have any kind of travel restrictions at all\u201d.\n\nAs well as travel restrictions, ministers must also consider future plans for domestic testing.\n\nThe system has come under pressure in recent weeks as cases have surged, with appointment slots and home test kits periodically being temporarily unavailable.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Mr Johnson announced plans for 100,000 critical workers to take daily tests.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph has reported that the government is planning to change testing rules so that people who test positive on lateral flow devices do not need to take a confirmatory PCR test.\n\nThe government did not comment but pointed to the guidance from the UK Health Security Agency which maintains that people should take a follow-up PCR test if they receive a positive lateral flow result.\n\n\u201cWe continue to review PCR availability and continue to make more PCR booking slots available every day,\u201d the agency said.\n\nTravellers must pay for private tests rather than using free NHS tests.\n\nMAG chief executive Charlie Cornish and Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said the government should press ahead with the \u201cimmediate removal\u201d of travel testing requirements which come at \u201chuge cost\u201d to the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore vital they do not remain in place a day longer than is necessary,\u201d they wrote in a statement.\n\nA government spokesperson said that they keep all measures \u201cunder review\u201d and added that the temporary testing requirements were introduced to \u201cprevent additional Omicron cases from entering the UK, stopping people from passing it on to others if they are infected\u201d.\n\nThe Times has reported that the requirement for people to take a pre-departure test before they arrive in England is likely to be dropped by the government in the update later. But it said the requirement that people take a PCR test within two days of arriving in England is set to remain.\n\nSeparately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: \u201cWith so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it\u2019s likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday.\u201d\n\nA recent report by aviation analytics firm Cirium found that the Covid pandemic triggered a 71% drop in international flights in and out of the UK in 2021.",
