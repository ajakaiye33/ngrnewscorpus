          "title": "Impact of 2023 General Election on Nigerian Capital Market",
          "text": "David Adonri\n\nPolitics and economy are interconnected. In democracy, elected politicians govern and formulate the policies which drive socio-economic development.\n\nThe choices made by politicians are also influenced by economic imperatives and social factors. The influence of politics on the economy is so monumental that it touches the economic life of every person and business.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:No diversion of funds meant for 2019 Hajj airlift \u2014 Medview\u2019s Muneer Bankole\n\nThis is why investors should be concerned about the possible impact of the 2023 general election in Nigeria on their portfolios and the capital market.\n\nElection is the basic foundation upon which democracy is built. It is a periodic ritual performed to strengthen the fabric of democracy. In advanced democracies, the build-up to elections is characterized by intellectual debates, sober reflections, manifesto presentations, political engagements and campaigns, all executed in carnival-like festivity.\n\nThe departure from this ideal during the 2020 US Presidential election, where brigandage took center stage, was an aberration. Regrettably, the fierce build-up to Nigerian elections has always evoked anxiety and fear in the minds of the electorate.\n\nThe elevated political risk that comes with this process is always a major worry for investors because markets do not like uncertainty, and general elections raise political uncertainties.\n\nRight from the penultimate year to the election, the socio-political atmosphere becomes charged. Politicians resort to violent rhetoric and divisive tactics which deepens the country\u2019s socio-political fault lines, in order to establish a competitive edge. During this period, the economy becomes overloaded with money arising from excessive election spendings which spikes inflation.\n\nGovernance is abandoned for politicking and economic decisions become driven by political expediences. All these dreaded happenings have become known as the penultimate year syndrome. As in previous penultimate years, the evolving political environment is expected to influence investors\u2019 sentiments.\n\nAwareness of the impact of election risk in the past can uncover recurring patterns which investors can learn from, in order to estimate how the next general election will affect their portfolios and hence, fashion out strategies to weather election cycles.\n\nSince the end of the last military administration, Nigeria has conducted six (6) general elections. The transition to democracy started with the 1999 general election. Considering how General Babangida brazenly truncated the most credible election in Nigeria\u2019s history in 1993, the 1999 general election conducted by the military was viewed with skepticism.\n\nBased on fears of likely socio-political unrest, several investors exited equities between June 1998 and May 1999. In the penultimate election year, the equities market declined by 18% because of political uncertainty and due to weak economic fundamentals. In that period, crude oil price hovered around USD25 per barrel and external reserve was as low as USD4.9 billion.\n\nTension lessened when the two presidential candidates for the election emerged from the same region. Evidence, therefore, shows that the 1999 general election had a bearish impact on the capital market before inauguration in May 1999. After inauguration, there was a bullish surge which drove equities up by 25% in June 1999.\n\nUncertainties surrounding the 2003 general election were whittled down by a lesser fear for a civilian to civilian transition and the high expectations for re-election of the incumbent President Obasanjo.\n\nEconomic fundamentals had improved with crude oil price at USD30 per barrel, external reserve at USD7.5 billion and exchange rate at N140 / USD. Equities appreciated by 11% in the penultimate year and experienced a massive post election surge of 66% in 2003. Therefore, it can be concluded that election risk had minimal impact on the capital market in 2002 / 2003.\n\nAlthough President Obasanjo\u2019s devilish moves to succeed himself for third term in office heated the polity in 2006, political risk that attended the 2007 general election was immaterial. It was evident that democracy had come to stay.\n\nThe ruling party had repaired the damaged economy and was in pole position to victory. During that election period, the capital market was driven mainly by favourable economic developments which included high macroeconomic liquidity facilitated by increased foreign portfolio investment, margin lending and banking sector reforms. In 2007, the Naira appreciated by 17% to N122 / USD, boosted by strong foreign reserves of USD52 billion. In 2006, the equities market appreciated by 38%.\n\nThe upbeat continued in the 2007 election year with unimaginable growth of equities which appreciated by 75% making the Nigerian capital market the best performing in the world that year.\n\nIn spite of the politically motivated killings in Northern Nigeria after the untimely death of President Musa Yar\u2019Adua in 2010, and the violent moves to retain the presidency in the North, heightened political risk had minimal impact on the capital market. Stern regulatory interventions in 2010 to rescue the financial system pushed equities up by 18.5%. However, the gain was lost in 2011 when equities declined by 16.3% due to the nationalization of three distressed banks and a hike in interest rate six times during the year. Therefore, economic factors impacted the capital market more in the 2011 general election.\n\nBuildup to the 2015 general election was tumultuous. Internal rancour within the ruling party saw defection of political heavy weights to a newly formed mega party, APC. Terrorist attacks by Boko Haram also occurred with ferocious intensity and when added to woes of the failing economy, equities fell by 23.21% in 2014. It went further down by 17.36% in 2015 because the outcome of the presidential election was unexpected and depressing for investors.\n\nFrom the second quarter of 2018, things started falling apart in the capital market. The build-up to the 2019 general election started impacting the market negatively. Freighted foreign and domestic investors exited the market which plunged it into a liquidity crisis and loss of 17.81% in 2018. The situation deteriorated further in 2019 as the presidential election was judged non-credible and fraudulent, thus sparking weak macroeconomic conditions and low investors\u2019 confidence which made equities depreciate by 14.6%.\n\nNigeria is once more approaching another general election.\n\nHistorical antecedents indicate that on average, both equities and bonds show positive or negative performance in the penultimate year and immediately after election. While the drama of general elections can make your imagination run wild, what you need to watch out for is how the unfolding scenario will affect the economy, the capital market and your portfolio.\n\nIt may be helpful to stick to a long term strategy, which is longer than any election cycle, as returns in the capital market are made over a full business cycle, which may be longer than even one presidential term. For investors with low risk tolerance, the safety of bonds can douse their apprehensions.",

          "text": "President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba has alleged that the emergence of queues in filling stations are part of conspiracy theories to force subsidy down the throat of Nigerians.\n\nWabba said the NLC was watching closely as events unfold.\n\nThe NLC had directed its affiliates to mobilise for nationwide protests following the proposed plan by the Federal Government to remove fuel subsidy.\n\nHowever, following the decision of the government to drop the subsidy removal plans, the NLC rescind its decisions on January 25, 2022.\n\nThere has been increasing queues in Lagos and Abuja with black marketers flooding major highways with petrol in cans, selling to motorists on the roadside\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSpeaking at the Nigeria Union of Teachers solemn assembly on Tuesday, the NLC President questioned why there was fuel scarcity immediately after the government stated that it had shelved its decision to remove the fuel subsidy.\n\nWabba said: \u201cWe are very watchful. We have seen that queues are surfacing which means that there is a conspiracy theory to force the policy of removal of fuel subsidy down the throat of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe have found out that some of these filling stations have products with three to five dispensing machines but they will use one and then close by 5 p.m. This was not the case before the pronouncement of the policy. Filling stations that do operate 24 hours have stopped operating and no one is giving explanation.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian workers and Nigerians in general are continuously being exploited and we have the responsibility to protect all of us from all the cabals that are repeatedly benefiting from this so called subsidies.\u201d\n\nWabba also spoke on the proposed plan of the National Assembly to remove labour unions from the exclusive list.\n\nHe noted that labour issues were presently domiciled in the Second Schedule, Legislative Powers, Part 1, Exclusive list, Item 34.\n\nAccording to him, labour, including trade unions, industrial relations; conditions, safety and welfare of labour; industrial disputes; prescribing a national minimum wage for the federation or any part thereof; and industrial arbitration.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor the sake of our national interest, security and industrial harmony, labour should not be one of the items that should be devolved to the states.\u201d\n\nWabba, while explaining how it came to be on the Exclusive List, noted that the nation-states legislation on Labour is driven substantially from the International Labour Organisation Conventions, protocols and recommendations and other instruments domesticated through the Acts of parliament.\n\nHe added that this explained the near uniformity of labour laws across the nations of the world and relative global industrial order, harmony and an attraction for foreign investment.\n\nWabba said this was in realisation of the reality that 17 days after independence in 1960 under a democratic government Nigeria fell in line by rectifying and domesticated ILO Conventions 87 and 98, guaranteeing the right to organise and collectively bargain.\n\nHe, however, said that Nigeria had since adopted all the core conventions in its capacity as a sovereign nation and regularly attends ILO organ meetings as a sovereign in line with international best practices.",

Tambuwal, accompanied by the former Sokoto Governor Attahiru Bafarawa, former Deputy Governor Mukhtar Shagari, and former Minister of Power, Engr Bello Suleiman, appreciated the unity of purpose displayed by the Kebbi state PDP stalwarts and followers during the recent local government election held in the state.\n\n\u201cAll political watchers in the country on Saturday witnessed the political sagacity of the state PDP, which is united. Your vigilance and cohesion in realization of such feat will help the party on the national front,\u201d he noted.\n\nFor this reasons, he said it was imperative for PDP stakeholders to unite and cooperate. \u201cThis will attract more people, who are already on the verge of crossing over to it,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cThe PDP in Kebbi state is united. The PDP in Kebbi state is compact and strong. I appeal to you to work together as a family to attract more members from the opposition because there is a lot of trouble in the other house.\n\n\u201cI know they will leave and come here. When they come I implore you to be very magnanimous so that when they come, you should be accommodating and carry everybody along, so that together, God willing, we shall win the elections here In Kebbi State and in Nigeria come 2023,\u201d Governor Tambuwal said.\n\nTurning to the situation in the country under the control of the APC, Tambuwal lamented for that Nigeria was on the verge of collapse as a result of insecurity, debilitating healthcare system, poverty, falling standard of education, corruption and other ills that have become the hallmark of the APC administration thus far.\u201d\n\nFormer Sokoto state Governor Bafarawa, who described the visit as homecoming, expressed happiness with the integrity displayed by the Kebbi state chapter of the PDP during the local council election held in the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for consultation between you and our own who seeks the coveted office of President in Nigeria God willing,\u201d Bafarawa added, urging supporters to sustain their prayers and backing for Governor Tambuwal.\n\nRecounting Tambuwal\u2019s antecedents, as Speaker of the House of Representatives and Governor of Sokoto state, he said \u201cthis is why we are backing you to fly the PDP Presidential ticket in 2023.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe success of this quest is predicated upon the choice of party delegates. We\u2019re sure Kebbi PDP delegates will readily vote for him,\u201d just as he recalled that in 2019 three of them- himself, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki (SAN) and Tambuwal all sought the same position of flying the PDP Presidential flag; and, Tambuwal emerged second.\u201d\n\nNow, he said, both him and Turaki, who supported Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, who clinched the ticket then, are now ready to work for Tambuwal.\n\nIn his welcome address, former acting National Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Bello Halliru Muhammad expressed gratitude to Gov. Tambuwal ano his entourage for the visit, pointing out that Nigeria needs a competent, trustworthy and courageous leader, like Tambuwal.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in bad shape after years of (misrule) by President Muhammadu Buhari. The country has never been so divided along ethnic and religious affiliations like now. If a worthy person doesn\u2019t take over (Nigeria) risks breaking apart,\u201d Alhaji Halliru noted.\n\nIn his remarks, the Kebbi state PDP Chairman, Alhaji Bello Usman Suru, said: \u201chistorically we in Kebbi are one with the people of Sokoto. You don\u2019t need to campaign here. All the state delegates, chairmen of local government wings and members of the executives in the state will vote for you.\n\n\u201cWhen it is time to decide who becomes our party\u2019s Presidential candidate, we may exceed even Sokoto state. I say this because there may be some black legs in Sokoto, but here we are behind you one hundred per cent.\n\nDuring the visit Gov. Tambuwal and his entourage were accorded rousing welcome by the leadership and followers of Kebbi state PDP, including the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Ibrahim Abdullahi, former minister for special duties, Alhaji Kabiru Tanimu Turaki (SAN), former Chief of Army Staff, Gen.

          "text": "\u2022Buhari allegedly in agreement with decision\n\n\u2022Mustapha, Bwari, Al-Makura top list\n\n\u2022Party to grant waiver to intending defectors, including Jonathan\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nWith the February 26 National Convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) inching closer, leaders and stakeholders of the party, particularly, governors, ministers, and members of the National Assembly, are searching for a consensus candidate that would lead the party to the general election in 2023.\n\nA reliable source told THISDAY that President Muhammadu Buhari had consonant views, and that he actually handed down the option of a consensus candidate for national chairman before jetting out to Ethiopia to attend the African Union (AU) meeting last week. The president returned to the country yesterday.\n\nAmong those being considered for the post of national chairman, a source further hinted, included former Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Bawa Bwari from Niger State, Saliu Mustapha from Kwara State, and Senator Tanko Al-Makura from Nasarawa State.\n\nThese three prospective candidates were allegedly mentioned repeatedly by many of the major stakeholders of the party as suitable to lead the APC to a successful election in 2023.\n\nFollowing media reports that APC was considering fielding former President Goodluck Jonathan as its presidential candidate in 2023, the ruling party said defectors to the party, including Jonathan, would be given waiver to contest.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the APC stakeholders were informed that in their search for a consensus candidate for national chairman, \u201cThey should put into considerations factors, like energy, credibility, experience, and ability to drive and sustain the winning streak of the party in the next general election.\u201d\n\nAccording to a northern governor, who pleaded anonymity, \u201cThe president had informed us that the only way he would be part of the much talked about idea of a consensus national chairman is for the stakeholders to ensure that whosoever that will emerge meets certain irreducible leadership criteria, chief of which are character and credibility factors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the ruling party was considering adopting the consensus option to avoid the crisis that could follow the election of a national chairman, bearing in mind that the national convention was around the corner.\n\nThe source explained that though \u201cthe office of the national chairman has not been officially zoned to any of the geopolitical zones in the north, in principle, the party may yield to the agitations of the stakeholders of the party from the North-central zone.\u201d\n\nThe source explained further that at several meetings of the APC governors with the party\u2019s National Assembly members as well as members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the three aspirants from the North-central had been consistently mentioned.\n\nBwari was Minister of State for Mines and Steel from 2015 to 2019. He was also Chief Whip in the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2007.\n\nMustapha was Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive change (CPC), Buhari\u2019s legacy party before the merger that birthed APC. He was also Organising Secretary of the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) at some point.\n\nAl-Makura, a serving senator, was governor of Nasarawa State.\n\nWhile Mustapha and Al-Makura had long declared their intentions and embarked on rigorous campaigns across the country, Bwari was yet to officially declare his intention at the time of filing this report.\n\nMustapha and Al-Makura also appear to enjoy the full and open backing of their governors, Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and Abdulahi Sule, respectively.\n\nTHISDAY was told that the stakeholders might have drafted the three names for possible security screening to avoid selecting anyone with the baggage of controversies as national chairman.\n\nBarring any further delays, the outcome of the security profiling of the three might form the basis of the choice that would be sent to the president early next week.\n\nAccording to the source, the security profiling was discretely undertaken to avoid any embarrassment to the ruling party.\n\nThough it was gathered that two former governors \u2013 Abduallahi Yari of Zamfara and Modu Sheriff of Borno State \u2013 were still protesting adoption of a consensus option, the source said their protest might not hold water since the president had bought into the idea.\n\nIn the same vein, two aspirants for national secretary from Anambra State, Ambassador Jerry Sunny Ugokwe and Nze Chidi Duru, may emerge. The implication is that the office of National Secretary may have been zoned to the South-east.\n\nMeanwhile, following media reports and on-going permutations that APC was considering fielding Jonathan as its presidential candidate in 2023, the ruling party reiterated that defectors to the party would be given waiver to contest.\n\nJonathan had of late been paying visits to Buhari in Aso Rock, and holding private discussions.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday by telephone, National Secretary of APC\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator James Akpanudoedehe, reiterated that anyone that defected to the party, by virtue of the December Resolution, would be given a waiver to contest, including the former president. Though Akpanudoedehe said he was not aware if the former president was planning to come to the party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said, \u201cGo back to my former reaction. I cannot bring out that topic again on the front burner. I cannot bring up that matter, because I actually answered that question about Goodluck Jonathan and I told Nigerians that anybody that comes into the party by the resolution of December has the right to contest.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that the caretaker committee has endorsed him; I am not aware that the caretaker has endorsed anybody. I\u2019m not aware that he (Jonathan) has been wooed to join the party. I am not privy to that.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "With Withdrawal of Wrong Fuel from Circulation, Queues Return to Abuja, Lagos, Others",
          "text": "\u2022Petroleum marketers confirm presence of adulterated fuel in circulation\n\n\u2022 Motorists in FCT spend hours in queues, traffic grounded\n\n\u2022 Group wants alleged petrol hoarders arrested, prosecuted\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nFollowing the supply of a wrong specification of petrol in some parts of the country, and its subsequent removal in compliance with a government order, long queues have once more returned to petrol stations in Abuja, parts of Lagos, and some other states.\n\nIndications emerged yesterday that the current challenge being faced in the supply of petrol in some states was as a result of the directive to withdraw adulterated products from circulation.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the shortage of supply from the sole importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), had worsened the situation.\n\nIn Abuja and surrounding states, majority of filling stations were shut and motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open, and causing serious traffic jams in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) blamed the shortage of supply on issues surrounding the presence of bad fuel in the market as well as undersupply from the national oil company.\n\nThe particular cargo with the product was said to have high sulphur, while marketers were advised not to sell to consumers, with at least 100 million litres already in circulation at the time the bad fuel was discovered.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the queues returned partly because the gap, which existed when depot owners started hoarding products before the announcement of retention of subsidy by the federal government, had not smoothened. This has affected the lifting of the products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\n\nThe federal government had backtracked on its plan to remove fuel subsidy in mid-2022, citing the need to protect the poor and vulnerable.\n\nMany of the fuel stations visited, including Eterna and Enyo on Olusegun Obasanjo Way in Wuse as well as Total on Herbert Macaulay, did not have product and more than half of the fuel pumps at the NNPC mega station in the area were not operational.\n\nSouth-West Zonal Chairman of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Dele Tajudeen, who confirmed the existence of contaminated fuel in circulation while speaking on a national television yesterday, absolved the organisation of any blame. Tajudeen explained that that IPMAN members had suffered severe losses and may ask for damages from the authorities.\n\nAccording to him, members of his group were supplied with bad products, which had put them in serious trouble, as they had to repair vehicles for their customers whose cars were impacted by the bad product.\n\nStressing that fuel station owners are now rejecting the bad product, he explained that the group was working to resolve the issue amicably with NNPC\u2019s subsidiary, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC).\n\n\u201cWe need to be compensated, but we don\u2019t want to put the masses in another crisis if we resort to going on strike, demanding compensation because we know people are already in a deep economic problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IPMAN official assured that the issue of bad fuel in circulation was already being investigated, stating that Managing Director of PPMC, Mr Isiaku Abdullahi, was intervening in the matter.\n\n\u201cUntil the investigation is concluded, I don\u2019t want to comment more, so as not to pre-empt it, but Mr Abdullahi is making efforts to ensure that all the depots are revived. He is doing a holistic rehabilitation of the depots,\u201d he said.\n\nTajudeen added, \u201cThis (fuel scarcity) is as a result of short supply from the NNPC and, of course, the private depots around Lagos. One of the major reasons for the scarcity is that the five NNPC depots in southwest as at today are not loading products.\n\n\u201cAlso, we witnessed the issue of bad product and I must use this opportunity to tell the masses that it is not from our members. As a matter of fact we suffered serious loss of cash and integrity because we received the product from the private depots.\n\n\u201cAs I am telling you, we have run into millions of naira in losses as a result of this bad product. So, the station owners are not responsible for these product.\u201d\n\nTajudeen commended Abdullahi for his efforts at ameliorating the situation, describing him as proactive. He said most of their customers had been complaining, prompting them to carry out repairs, replacement of the bad fuels and bearing the reputational damage caused by the situation.\n\nHe pointed out, \u201cThe situation is not too good because of non-availability of this product, coupled with this bad product that came in the last two weeks. The products are being rejected now. So, because of that, there\u2019s shortage of product.\u201d\n\nOn the rising cost of diesel, Tajudeen stated that while the product had gone to N401 without the logistics costs, petrol has gone to N156 without transport costs, saying it will then hit N162 to N163 before it gets do the stations. \u201cOur profit margin has been eroded completely,\u201d he lamented.\n\nBut he argued that government could not leave pricing in private hands because it will \u201cstrangulate the masses\u201d, adding that the international crude oil prices does not necessarily tally with the rise in prices in the country.\n\nA top NNPC official who spoke with THISDAY on the matter, stated that whatever the situation, it was the responsibility of the new downstream/midstream authority to speak on the matter.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThey (the queues) will disappear. It\u2019s just a small supply gap. People are bound to make all sorts of speculations, but if the speculation continues, the downstream/midstream authority will come up with a statement to clarify whatever is happening.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a civil advocacy group yesterday called on the federal government to take a decisive action against those alleged to be hoarding petrol in the country, and subjection unbearable hardship on the masses.\n\nThe group, in a letter to the Minister of State for Petroleum and Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), specifically accused members of independent marketers of petroleum products of hoarding fuel, which according to them, was responsible for the long queues at fuel stations across the country, particularly the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and its environs.\n\nThe letter dated February 7, 2022, and signed by the group\u2019s Convener, Mr. Deji Adeyanju, was titled, \u201cPersistent Hoarding of Fuel By Independent Marketers: A Call for Urgent Action.\u201d\n\nIt said, \u201cAs you may already know, in recent months independent marketers of petroleum products have engaged in speculative acts of hoarding petroleum products, particularly PMS, in a bid to criminally increase the prices, cause artificial scarcity and plunge the country into widespread economic chaos.\n\n\u201cFor example, filing stations across the nation\u2019s capital are littered with long queues of vehicles seeking to purchase fuel, while the independent marketers ensured that their filing stations were shut for the day by 6pm.\u201d\n\nThe group, however, lamented that the regulators had not deemed it necessary to call these independent marketers to order, as they had continued to allow them take advantage of Nigerians.\n\nThe convener expressed pain that the development was causing excruciating pain on the people, adding that an artificial fuel scarcity is the last thing they should worry about.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is equally important to point out that causing artificial scarcity resulting in economic sabotage is a criminal offence under our laws.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must, therefore, put a halt to the ball watching and take urgent steps to address the economic sabotage, especially as there is no reason for artificial scarcity at this time.\n\n\u201cSequel to the foregoing, we call on the federal government to arrest the offending marketers, shut their filling stations and bring this on-going economic sabotage to an end. Nigerians deserves to buy fuel at an accessible rate anytime.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Amended Electoral Bill Bars Ministers, Commissioners from Contesting in Primaries",
          "text": "*Bill prescribes sanctions for erring parties\n\n*Advises aggrieved potential aspirants to approach federal high court for relief\n\n*Says judicial pronouncement can\u2019t stop primary or general election\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nShould President Muhammadu Buhari sign the new Electoral Act amendment bill recently forwarded to him by the National Assembly into law, all political appointees in his government would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of their political parties.\n\nThe implication is that some key ministers in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, said to be nursing presidential ambitions would be barred from seeking the nominations of their parties.\n\nWhat this therefore, means is that ministers, commissioners and other political appointees are expected to resign ahead of their parties\u2019 primaries in order to be eligible to contest in the primaries.\n\nTop on the list of the aspiring appointees to be affected by this new amendment are the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; and Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. They are believed to have presidential ambitions, even though they have yet to declare their interests.\n\nBut by the provision at issue, political appointees are also barred from voting as delegates in a convention or seeking nomination in the primaries of their political parties.\n\nUnlike what was obtainable in the past when most APC ministers and commissioners took leave of absence to contest their party\u2019s primaries and later went back to their jobs after they lost, that grace is no longer available.\n\nHowever, with the new amendment, if signed by the President, they would henceforth be required to vacate office completely before being eligible to contest.\n\nThe bill also advises aggrieved aspirants to seek redress at the Federal High Court if they suspect the political parties did not comply with the relevant provisions in the selection of candidates.\n\nAccording to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nBut there appears to be a lacuna in the new law, which may encourage infringements on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.\n\nThe Supreme Court had pronounced at different times that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution is ultra vires and, to that extent, null and void.\n\nSources believe the clause is meant to clip the wings of the governors, who, through appointments, often control those who become automatic delegates and determine the outcome of congresses.\n\nSources further claimed that the idea was originally from the House of Representatives, pushed by a principal officer from Lagos as an agenda to serve some interests. The senate was said to have concurred, just to keep the \u201cone house\u201d refrain of the National Assembly.\n\nBut the fear being expressed by many is that, with a clause that clearly breaches the provision of the constitution, the president might be forced to veto the electoral act amendment bill again. If this happens, a new electoral law may not be ready for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe National Assembly had recently transmitted the new Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill to Buhari for assent, through the Clerk of the National Assembly, Olatunde Ojo. Before the latest transmission, Buhari had in December 2021, vetoed the former amendment bill, leading to a recommittal by the National Assembly.\n\nThere have been misgivings about the new amendment, fuelling speculations on whether or not the president would sign it into law. The latest speculation was stoked by rumours that some governors, especially, those of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), were not comfortable with the new amendment and had planned to prevail on the president to also veto it, as he did in the last one.\n\nThe harmonised version of the Electoral Bill recently passed by the legislature was considered the final agreed version by both Senate and House of Representatives on the amendment to Clause 84 of the bill.\n\nIn this clause, the direct, indirect and consensus modes of primary election by political parties were included. This was after the controversy that trailed the different versions initially approved by the two chambers.\n\nThe senate had in its re-amended bill approved direct, indirect, and consensus primaries for the nomination of candidates by political parties, while the House only provided direct and indirect modes, saying the president did not speak about the consensus option, when he vetoed the previous bill.\n\nBut President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, while presiding at plenary, stated that both chambers had agreed to give a clear and sufficient definition for each mode of primary, and how they would be conducted.\n\nLawan explained that for the consensus method, the two chambers produced a clear-cut definition on how a consensus candidate would emerge.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the first amendment bill over the provision of direct primary as the only mode of choosing candidates by political parties.\n\nThe bill earlier passed by the National Assembly on November 18, 2021, provided: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission.\u201d\n\nBut Buhari, in declining assent, disclosed that he would only give assent to the bill if the lawmakers provided options for the conduct of primaries by political parties.\n\nThe president also cited several disadvantages of the provision to the system, including security and possible manipulation by incumbent officeholders, who might be seeking re-election, as well as political parties\u2019 inability to muster funds for it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "'FG files more charges than it can prove' -- CJN speaks on delay in high-profile cases",
          "text": "Ibrahim Muhammad, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), says the federal government files more charges than it can prove in court.\n\nThe CJN said this in reaction to the claim by Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, that the judiciary is to blame for delays in prosecuting high-profile cases.\n\nIn an interview on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 on Monday, Malami said the federal government has employed measures to ensure speedy dispensation of cases, and that once a matter is brought before the court, it becomes a judiciary affair.\n\n\u201cAs far as the present administration is concerned, delay of cases does not arise. If you are looking at it from the perspective of the legislative framework, we are enforcing provisions of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), as in day-in-day-out prosecution of cases,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou cannot, by any stretch of imagination, place blame associated with the conclusion and determination of the case on the doorsteps of the executive. It is exclusively a judicial affair.\n\n\u201cWe have taken steps to provide the legislative framework. We have taken steps in due diligence of prosecution of cases, which as a result of multiple convictions within a span of a year, is a clear pointer that we have indeed promised and delivered.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a statement on Tuesday, the CJN, through his spokesperson, Isah Ahuraka, described Malami\u2019s position as \u201cone-sided\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe judiciary by its constitutional position does not have criminal investigation unit or \u2018fraud detective squad\u2019 to detect and investigate criminal involvement of any person, neither does it have a garrison command to fight its cause or enforce its orders and decisions,\u201d the CJN said.\n\n\u201cMore often than not, the federal government\u2019s prosecution sector files more charges than it can prove or provide witnesses to prove, ostensibly at times for the prosecution to even fail.\u201d\n\nHe said the ACJA referred to by the minister \u201cis infected with sores in some parts, making speeding adjudications improbable in some instances, in addition to high volume of cases, limited number of judges, poor infrastructure or archaic equipment\u201d.\n\nMuhammad added that Malami\u2019s allegation that the judiciary has not been transparent in its budget spending is untrue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough judiciary has refrained from joining issues all this while but to state the facts, in line with the budget call circular and ceiling the federal government sent to the judiciary before the commencement of the fiscal year, the judiciary prepares its budget estimates for capital, overhead cost and personnel cost according to the ceiling, needs and priority,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary defends its budget before the senate and the house of representatives committees on judiciary at the national assembly, besides the initial vetting by the executive.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary has an internal mechanism for budget control and implementation. Each court and judicial body has a budget unit, the account department, internal audit, due process unit, as well as departmental tenders board. There is also a due process committee at the NJC and the judicial tenders board that award contracts on expenditure above the approval limit of the accounting officers of the courts and judicial bodies.\n\n\u201cThese layers of control were established by the judiciary to ensure transparency, accountability and effective budget implementation. The type of transparency that the federal government has stressed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CJN also stated that the national assembly carries out an oversight function as empowered by sections 88 and 89 of the 1999 constitution, which also mandates it \u201cto expose corruption, inefficiency or waste in the execution or administration of laws within its legislative competence and in the disbursement or administration of funds appropriated by it\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe executive also put in place some mechanism to monitor budget implementation and accountability in the judiciary through its organs like the office of accountant-general of the federation and auditor-general of the federation and other agencies where the need arises,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cApart from the internal audit units of the judiciary, the Federal Audit Department maintains offices in all the courts and judicial bodies that monitor spending in the judiciary. If the federal audit raises a query on any transaction and it is not well defended, it sends such to the public account committees of the national assembly.

          "text": "Ibrahim Muhammad, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), says the federal government files more charges than it can prove in court.\n\nThe CJN said this in reaction to the claim by Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, that the judiciary is to blame for delays in prosecuting high-profile cases.\n\nIn an interview on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 on Monday, Malami said the federal government has employed measures to ensure speedy dispensation of cases, and that once a matter is brought before the court, it becomes a judiciary affair.\n\n\u201cAs far as the present administration is concerned, delay of cases does not arise. If you are looking at it from the perspective of the legislative framework, we are enforcing provisions of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), as in day-in-day-out prosecution of cases,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou cannot, by any stretch of imagination, place blame associated with the conclusion and determination of the case on the doorsteps of the executive. It is exclusively a judicial affair.\n\n\u201cWe have taken steps to provide the legislative framework. We have taken steps in due diligence of prosecution of cases, which as a result of multiple convictions within a span of a year, is a clear pointer that we have indeed promised and delivered.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a statement on Tuesday, the CJN, through his spokesperson, Isah Ahuraka, described Malami\u2019s position as \u201cone-sided\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe judiciary by its constitutional position does not have criminal investigation unit or \u2018fraud detective squad\u2019 to detect and investigate criminal involvement of any person, neither does it have a garrison command to fight its cause or enforce its orders and decisions,\u201d the CJN said.\n\n\u201cMore often than not, the federal government\u2019s prosecution sector files more charges than it can prove or provide witnesses to prove, ostensibly at times for the prosecution to even fail.\u201d\n\nHe said the ACJA referred to by the minister \u201cis infected with sores in some parts, making speeding adjudications improbable in some instances, in addition to high volume of cases, limited number of judges, poor infrastructure or archaic equipment\u201d.\n\nMuhammad added that Malami\u2019s allegation that the judiciary has not been transparent in its budget spending is untrue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough judiciary has refrained from joining issues all this while but to state the facts, in line with the budget call circular and ceiling the federal government sent to the judiciary before the commencement of the fiscal year, the judiciary prepares its budget estimates for capital, overhead cost and personnel cost according to the ceiling, needs and priority,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary defends its budget before the senate and the house of representatives committees on judiciary at the national assembly, besides the initial vetting by the executive.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary has an internal mechanism for budget control and implementation. Each court and judicial body has a budget unit, the account department, internal audit, due process unit, as well as departmental tenders board. There is also a due process committee at the NJC and the judicial tenders board that award contracts on expenditure above the approval limit of the accounting officers of the courts and judicial bodies.\n\n\u201cThese layers of control were established by the judiciary to ensure transparency, accountability and effective budget implementation. The type of transparency that the federal government has stressed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CJN also stated that the national assembly carries out an oversight function as empowered by sections 88 and 89 of the 1999 constitution, which also mandates it \u201cto expose corruption, inefficiency or waste in the execution or administration of laws within its legislative competence and in the disbursement or administration of funds appropriated by it\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe executive also put in place some mechanism to monitor budget implementation and accountability in the judiciary through its organs like the office of accountant-general of the federation and auditor-general of the federation and other agencies where the need arises,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cApart from the internal audit units of the judiciary, the Federal Audit Department maintains offices in all the courts and judicial bodies that monitor spending in the judiciary. If the federal audit raises a query on any transaction and it is not well defended, it sends such to the public account committees of the national assembly. Officials of the judiciary would be invited to explain themselves.\n\n\u201cThe question to ask is who else should the judiciary open its account books to and who among these organs had raised exceptions which were not defended by the third arm? The answer is none.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne only hopes that these allegations against the judiciary by the federal government is not just a way of giving a dog a bad name so as to then hang it.\u201d",

          "text": "After more than five years in operation, Meta has announced it\u2019s shutting down Express Wi-Fi, a program designed to provide low-cost internet in developing countries through partnerships with local communities, mobile operators and businesses.\n\nThe shut down of Express Wi-Fi comes barely a year after Meta partnered with Eutelsat Konnect, a satellite operator, to expand the low-cost internet service in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Zambia, Cameroon, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nNotably, in countries like Kenya, Express Wi-Fi has been unavailable since mid-December 2020. The service is currently active in over 30 countries across Africa, Asia and South America. Similar to this announcement, about a year ago, Google shut down project Loon, one of it\u2019s low-cost internet projects active in Kenya. A move that made people question the fate of internet projects in Africa by big corporations.\n\nLaunched in 2016, Express Wi-Fi program was designed as an improvement to Meta\u2019s earlier failed Free Basics program. It was designed to be inexpensive, starting at around 15 cents for 100MB or $5 for 20GB.\n\nMeta said that while it\u2019s winding down Express Wi-Fi, it\u2019s focusing on other projects around internet access.\n\n\u201cWhile we are concluding our work on this program to focus on developing other projects, we remain committed to working with partners across the telecom ecosystem to deliver better connectivity,\u201d a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. It promised to work with Express Wi-Fi partners to \u201cminimize the impact to their businesses while keeping networks running.\u201d\n\nThe company first revealed its plans to build a 37,000-kilometer subsea cable, named 2Africa, in May 2020, and it announced an expansion in 2021, which is expected to be completed in 2023 or 2024.\n\nMeta\u2019s different initiatives are part of its efforts to bridge the internet gap across emerging markets like Africa, where connectivity is lowest across the globe. Currently about 28% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population is connected to mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy report. The end of Express Wi-Fi program signals a change in Meta\u2019s approach to delivering low-cost internet across Africa.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Paris-born Nigerian singer, Asa, was recently announced the Spotify EQUAL Global Music Programme ambassador for the month of February.\n\nIn April 2021, months after it expanded to 38 African countries, Spotify launched the Spotify EQUAL Music Programme in commemoration of International Women\u2019s Day. According to Spotify, the programme\u2014which consists of highlighted playlists created and marketed by Spotify\u2014was launched to highlight women creators on its platform and work towards equity for women in the audio industry.\n\nGlobally, charts are often dominated by male performers. From 2017 to 2019, for example, Hypebot reports that only 21% of performers on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 were women. Apple Music and Spotify, during the same period, had even less, with female performers representing only 19% of charts. In 2018, at Spotify\u2019s 10th-year anniversary, only 2 women\u2014Rihanna and Ariana Grande\u2014made the 10-year streaming charts. Critics have also commented on how the most visible and high-ranking playlists on Spotify are male-dominated. More recently, Spotify itself funded research that showed only 1 in 5 artistes on the charts are women. This research helped fuel the drive for its EQUAL Global Music Programme.\n\nSince its launch, the programme has curated 17 playlists featuring female artistes all over the globe. The EQUAL Africa playlist\u2014which has over 70,000 likes\u2014 has 50 songs from female artistes from all over the continent. This includes songs from Ghana-born singer, Gyakie, who has had over 13.5 million streams on Spotify, Nigeria\u2019s Ayra Starr who recently hit 1 million streams on the platform, Zambia\u2019s Titose, Morocco\u2019s Rhita Nattah, and Botswana\u2019s Sebina.\n\nAsa, who has over 375,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, is the latest on the list. Her recently released track, Mayana, will lead the EQUAL Africa playlist and also feature on the EQUAL Global playlist. Mayana already has over 560,000 streams on Spotify, and the addition to EQUAL playlists will boost it further.\n\nSpeaking about her selection, the singer said, \u201cI\u2019m honoured to be the Spotify EQUAL ambassador of the month. It\u2019s great to be part of something like this\u2014a movement that\u2019s new yet has always been. It\u2019s beautiful when we are celebrated and recognised for contributions to music and art over the years. In the lead-up to the release of my album \u2018V\u2019, this is awesome.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What\u2019s it like building in unpopular sectors?",
          "text": "Building a successful business in an unpopular sector is difficult globally, especially in Africa. In such sectors, there are almost no supporting communities and infrastructure to leverage for growth. So, founders interested in such sectors would have to build from scratch.\n\nBut, regardless of how difficult it is to build in Africa, some people have done it and are still doing it. Now the question is, how?\n\nOn January 22, 2021, Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, spoke with Judith Okonkwo, founder/CEO at Imisi 3D and one of the outliers who have built a successful venture in a sector that\u2019s not hugely celebrated, to answer this question, during the second episode of Building From Ground Up, Season 2 by the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.\n\nImisi 3D, an Extended Reality (XR) creation lab that focuses on building the African XR ecosystem in Nigeria and beyond, was founded in 2017 in Lagos, Nigeria. And its core mission is to groom and grow a community of African AR/VR creators, create solutions using AR/VR, and provide educational and engagement experiences with AR/VR.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA slow lonely road\n\nJudith Okonwo, whose career spans 22 years across many industries and continents, comes from a business psychology background. When she founded Imisi 3D, some people thought her decision was ambitious, others thought it was silly. But 5 years on, Imisi3D is not only a successful venture, it has placed Nigeria and Africa in the global XR conversation.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build an XR ecosystem and nobody was really seeing why such a thing should exist. It\u2019s a crazy idea,\u201d said Okonkwo. Regardless of which sector one\u2019s building, the early days are usually lonely and filled with trial and errors in product iterations and product-market fit.\n\nSeek knowledge and leveraging your network\n\nHaving in-depth knowledge about a business will make the building less strenuous. However, in a case where you don\u2019t know much about the territory, the best thing to do is to put yourself out there to seek real-life knowledge on how your solution will solve real-life problems. According to Okonkwo, the best way to keep your leg on the ground is by talking to people and asking for help when you need it.\n\n\u201cComing from my background, the first thing I needed to do was to learn, aggressively,\u201d said Okonkwo who is also a founding director of AR/VR Africa.\n\nAfter gaining knowledge, the next thing is to leverage your network for support. Remember the territory is unpopular with almost no existing infrastructural support, so your best chance at success lies with people.\n\nSell the vision clearly to your people\n\nNow that things are getting better and people are less dismissive of your \u201ccrazy\u201d idea, setting a clear goal that puts everybody on the same page is important. For Okonkwo, the vision was clear: an impact-driven venture that would create an advanced and thriving XR ecosystem across Africa, starting from Nigeria.\n\nOkonkwo said Imisi 3D got its first lab at CcHub because she was speaking to everybody that cared to listen\u2014sharing what the success of their venture would mean to the country and Africa at large. Having helped Andela launch, Okonkwo was exposed to the possibility of what Africa\u2019s young people could build when given a platform, so quickly defined her vision to do what Andela was doing but for XR.\n\n\u201cOur mission and goal is specific and written on the wall. It\u2019s important because we could see that XR is one future of computer, and we must be involved now if we want to be part of that future,\u201d Okonkwo said about the vision of Imisi3D.\n\nThe arrival of mass acceptance\n\nEntrepreneurs in unpopular territories are outliers; they are people who can project and see what the future holds and decide to build for that future. Although XR is as old as a century, it wasn\u2019t until recently that innovators started to think about commercialising this technology for the mass market.\n\nToday, there\u2019s a massive acceptance of the XR sector owning to the numerous conversation around blockchain and the metaverse, which is essentially a digital world powered by virtual reality. The buzz started in 2014 when Facebook acquired then 2-year-old Oculus for $2 billion to power its metaverse ambition. Last year Facebook rebranded as Meta, thus becoming a full XR company. Similarly, Apple also bought Space and NextVR, two different XR companies, to power its own metaverse ambition. In fact, almost all the big tech giants now understand the role XR will play in the future and are buying into it.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are now interested in the sector, it\u2019s no longer a crazy idea to want to build in this space,\u201d said Okonkwo. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing, more people means more innovation and investment.\u201d For Okonkwo and her team, the future of computers has always been XR, from the beginning of their foray into the sector; the rest of us are only just joining in.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Kalibotics is using robotics to revamp edtech, agritech, e-waste management",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, two Nigerian siblings, Olugbenga Abejirin and Mayowa Abejirin, who have technical capabilities in programming and software development, with the former armed with over a decade of experience in entrepreneurship, leveraged an opportunity to build and deploy smart classrooms to some Nigerian schools.\n\nThe early stage of the project was successful until the pandemic struck in 2020, and deployment was slowed down as access to spare parts abroad was impeded. However, the company had already covered eight Nigerian cities.\n\nPrimarily, the plan was to incorporate robotics into these smart classrooms riding on a previous project carried out in partnership with a Chinese university to build self-driving smart cars for educational purposes. However, this couldn\u2019t be deployed due to licensing challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKalibotics smart classroom\n\nThe seemingly discouraging outcomes of these two endeavours opened their eyes to something bigger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlugbenga recounts how they made the best of a daunting situation.\n\n\u201cThat was quite disappointing. But we had a video of the project they were doing. The partners showed us what it could do as well as the assembling process. So, we thought to ourselves, \u2018We can do this! Why don\u2019t we have a company that would create these robotic kits for the smart classrooms?\u2019\u201d\n\nEncouraged by their rich backgrounds in building tech products and entrepreneurship, they decided to go beyond smart classrooms. The result was the birth of robotics startup, Kalibotics, coined from two words: Kali, a Swahili term for \u2018energetic\u2019, and Robotics. Kalibotics launched officially in December 2019.\n\nRobots for real-life challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKalibotics drone\n\nAlthough education is Kalibotics\u2019 strong point, the startup is motivated to build products to address tough real-life challenges, something Olugbenga refers to as \u201cgoing all out.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the areas we\u2019re interested in and building robotic systems for are agritech, security, e-waste management, and other fields.\u201d\n\nElucidating, Mayowa lists products that the startup has been able to commercialise, including those it intends to deploy.\n\n\u201cOur first project was an obstacle avoidance car that uses ultrasonic sensors. After that, we went on to build an autonomous drone that can be easily repurposed for any artificial intelligence task like precision farming, and threat avoidance, among others.\u201d\n\nThe startup has also done other functional mini-projects like a robotic arm that can make a cup of tea and an AI Chessbot \u2014 a Chess-playing robot. In a few months, the prototype for an AI-based robot manipulator that can sort e-waste will be completed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating the Kalibotics Chessbot\n\nSolar-powered drones, autonomous rovers, and underwater drones for security and surveillance are at the ideation stage and will be developed in the coming months. This also includes other specific purpose drones for trash-picking.\n\nOlugbenga notes that most of the completed products are already commercialised while others are being trialled.\n\nBesides the hardware, the startup also has a proprietary Artificial Intelligence Robotics Coding (ARC), a curriculum it plans to get into schools soon.\n\nReacting to my scepticism about not focusing on only industry-specific products while in its early years, Olugbenga opines that the startup is maximising its capabilities with the three industries it currently specialises in and will build on this in the long-term. He believes this will take the startup to a growth phase, and once they have all been fully commercialised, the scope will increase.\n\nTo keep up with subsequent changes in the technology landscape, other projects will come up under the research and development department.\n\nLeading up to Kalibotics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Kalibotics, the duo has come a long way in building tech products and running businesses.\n\nIn fact, one of the businesses, Deepblue Technologies, has been running for over 13 years.\n\nLooking back to his beginning, Olugbenga recalls how he founded Longhall Consulting, a consulting startup that has morphed into Learning Fortress, an e-learning platform.\n\nFollowing this, he threw his weight behind Deepblue Technologies, a company focused on application development/deployment and technical support services. Interestingly, the company has been around for 13 years.\n\nOlugbenga asserts that Kalibotics\u2019 products are targeted majorly at large businesses and the government for obvious reasons. Mass waste management, for instance, is the government\u2019s responsibility; likewise, smallholder farmers are rarely as concerned about precision farming as large farmers are.\n\nHowever, the entrepreneur clarifies that there are exemption plans for edtech and agritech products.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to have variants. We have what is called Kalibotics Project Alpha, which is B2C. This will deliver proprietary kits and an e-learning platform so that individuals can have robotic kits in their homes and then go through our e-learning and can learn to install and do lots of interesting projects. This will be launched in 2022.\u201d\n\nFor him, introducing a B2C model is inevitable, not only for inclusiveness but also to widen its approachable market and broaden revenue opportunities.\n\nGetting the right attention for funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its early days, the startup had access to a $25,000 fund in angel investment. To celebrate his birthday in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, funded the March 8TH Initiative, where innovative companies were offered a \u20a61 million (~$2,400) grant. With its new and functional solutions, Kalibotics applied and ended up as one of the recipients.\n\nThanks to Kaibotics\u2019 e-waste management project, the startup was one of four finalists that won a \u20a620 million (~$48,000) grant in an innovation competition organised by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in 2021. But this wasn\u2019t the first time Kaibotics was recognised in this manner.\n\nAlthough still at the pre-profit stage, Olugbenga claims that the startup\u2019s goal is to make a social impact while making a profit. Compared to other robotics startups, the founder believes their strength lies in infusing many high-end technologies into their products, trusted business sense, dependable team, and access to funding.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing all the way, and sometimes, the founders have to train people to ensure they can successfully operate their products.\n\nNigeria is not big on manufacturing, so building prototypes can be pretty tough without support from outside the country. Despite this, the startup has gotten in the face of potential buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\n\nToday does not seem to be that day of the week where many African startups take over the news with several huge funding rounds. Trust me, funding news does excite me, but not as much as the massive transformations these startups have the potential to deliver in the edtech, insurtech, healthtech, open finance, and other industries they operate.\n\nNonetheless, we do have one. Nigeria\u2019s Reliance Health raised $40 million in a Series B round.\n\nToday on Techpoint Digest, I decided to explore artistes\u2019 interests in African startups, a scenario that has become more noticeable recently. I hope we can all find answers to the \u2018why?\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019s in it for them?\u2019 questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrican startups X Artistes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Nigerian startup, AltSchool, raised a $1m pre-seed to provide alternative schools for Africans. Besides VCs, other investors who participated in the round include two popular Nigerian artists, Folarin Falana (Falz) and Akitoye Balogun (Ajebutter).\n\nThis is not foreign to the African startup space. The best person to fit this description would be Ajibade Oluwatosin (Mr Eazi). As a founder himself, he runs a VC company, Africa Music Fund (AMF), that invests in African music talents. In 2020, AMF raised $20m. He also set up a syndicate fund, Zagadat Capital, to invest in African startups.\n\nDid you miss this? \u201cWatch out for pastor Eazi!\u201d \u2014 Mr Eazi, on creative prospects beyond tech investments\n\nDuring my conversation with Mr Eazi last year, he believed that music is a product and that being an artist is similar to running a startup, especially since both involve high uncertainty. Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, also held a similar opinion during Techpoint Build 2021 while discussing the next frontier in music with other panellists.\n\nAsides from investing, another noticeable occurrence is brand ambassadorship. This is commonplace in almost every industry, from sports to hospitality, and it\u2019s evident that startups are also getting in on it.\n\nLet\u2019s name a few: ChipperCash X Burna Boy, Kuda Bank X Fireboy DML, Flutterwave X Wizkid, Risevest X Teni, among others. Fintech much, huh?\n\nHere\u2019s what I think of this. Fans can be very loyal to their favourite artistes, which means they\u2019ll likely support what they support, no matter what. And what does this loyalty mean to the brand? I see a better monetisation potential. It\u2019s a different level of marketing, you know? That brand will get the same sentimental attachment fans with that artiste. Or am I exaggerating?\n\nWhile I see a massive opportunity here for these brands, I can\u2019t ignore how much goes into these partnerships in terms of funds. But then, these startups are highly valuable to start with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut can we say this is a win-win for both parties? How much ROI do these brands record apart from the familiar metric, which is the customer base? I\u2019m also curious, do artistes request equity instead of money?\n\nI believe you\u2019ll find this interesting? From Burna Boy to TV\u2019s Big Brother Naija, Nigerian startups are spending millions on celebrity endorsements\n\nReliance Health $40m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it feel to have an emergency surgery sorted without having to break a bank? That\u2019s one of the perks of health insurance. But providing this service within a low-trust space with people cynical about insurance like Africa gets complicated. Still, tech startups are working to change this outlook.\n\nNigerian healthtech startup, Reliance Health plays in this space. The startup partners with hospitals, pharmacies, clinical physicians, specialists, and other healthcare facilities to provide health insurance and telemedicine.\n\nAnd it has just raised $40m in a Series B round led by General Atlantic, Partech, Picus Capital, Tencent Exploration, Africa Healthcare Master Fund, P1 Ventures, Laerdal Million Lives Fund, and M3 Inc.\n\nThe six-year-old startup serves businesses and individuals via a subscription model and claims to be serving over 200,000 customers. This fund will be directed towards expansion to Egypt, to start with; funding two clinics in two Nigerian cities, hiring talents and introducing new products.\n\nInterestingly, Reliance Health\u2019s raise is the largest so far in Africa\u2019s healthtech space.\n\nRead more: Nigerian healthtech startup Reliance Health raises $40M led by General Atlantic\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nPaystack is hiring.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, there.\n\nIt seems every fifth market day \u2014 I\u2019m borrowing one of Chimgozirim\u2019s phrases here \u2014 there\u2019s some new drama on the streets of Nigerian Tech Twitter.\n\nThis weekend, the employee market took centre stage. And from this school of thought to this one, we saw different takes on whether employees should jump ship within six months of employment and whether they should accept freelance gigs. Made for some scintillating exchanges, if I\u2019m honest.\n\nWhat do you think, though? Should employees take freelance work? Are they unserious when they leave a job within a year? I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in Today\u2019s Digest, we\u2019d be discussing\n\nThe competition fintechs may not see coming, and\n\nThe tech/Afrobeats combo\n\nWho\u2019s competing with fintechs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the scene: These days, for a lot of financial transactions that we make, we often have to jump between different apps for them.\n\nTo transfer money, you have options ranging from your bank, your savings apps, and your investment apps. For bill payments, you\u2019d probably have to move to another app. And we\u2019ve not even touched on cross-border payments or options for investment or even the decentralised finance space.\n\nA crossroads: This situation just goes to show how inefficient the traditional banking system had become and why the need for fintechs like Paystack, Flutterwave, Cowrywise, among others, rose. But these fintechs might soon find themselves facing some stiff competition they might not have expected.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, though: I\u2019m not saying fintech startups are having a bad run, but here\u2019s the thing, there are a lot of them. Interestingly, when I talked to Adedeji Olowe last year for The Next Frontier series, he quite disagreed.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, Oluwatobi Boshoro, CEO of Infinitetiks, spoke on Business model innovation: the rise of ecosystems and platforms based on changing customer attitudes. While giving this overview, she touched on several things, including possible competition from non-fintech startups.\n\nCurious? You can check it out here: How changing customer attitudes will affect fintech business models in Africa\n\nThe next frontier in music tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed this newsletter long enough, you probably already know how much I love music \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m always giving you guys recommendations or anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this part of the world, streaming music didn\u2019t become a thing until platforms like Soundcloud, Boomplay, and others burst onto the scene. Before that, most of us got our music from illegal download sites, and if you could afford it, iTunes. Of course, you could purchase CDs and Vinyl too.\n\nNow, platforms like Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Music are currently trying to take a huge piece of the African pie.\n\nThey\u2019ve also helped catapult Afrobeats \u2014 one of Africa\u2019s most prominent exports on the music scene \u2014 to the world stage faster. Artists like Rema, Burna Boy, and Tems blazing trails and setting new records.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, the music panel had quite a bit to say, taking us through the history, the now, and probably the future.\n\nGrab your prefered poison and come along for this ride: Afrobeats: \u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika\n\nStories from the week before\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nPaystack is hiring.

          "text": "With about N11 billion so far paid as claims from the 2020 #EndSARS destructions, consumers, particularly small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) are showing increased appetite for insurance protection.\n\nAccording to industry sources, the consumers are pushing to renew their policies in 2022 to protect their assets and businesses, having seen how insurance companies compensated some victims of the #EndSARS protests.\n\nFrom the incident, insurance companies have paid out over N11 billion as of the end of January 2022, with the expectation that total claims when concluded would be about N20 billion.\n\nGaniyu Musa, chairman, Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) said the industry witnessed a better renewal season this 2022.\n\nAccording to him, the EndSARS experience has created a lot of awareness on the need for insurance protection, stating that beyond insurers adding it as part of their marketing, many people are aware of the series of claims paid to victims of the incident.\n\nGaniyu who is also the GMD of Cornerstone Insurance plc said during a press briefing in Lagos that payment of claims was a priority for the industry now more than ever, as no company can afford to joke with it.\n\n\u201cYes, we are in business to pay claims and that is why we are encouraging people to insurer themselves and their assets against the unexpected, Musa said.\n\nRead also: EndSARS white paper: Lagos complied with the law \u2013 Attorney-general\n\nHe said the industry expects that the EndSARS claims would be about N20 billion when concluded, stating that some unsettled and pending claims were being investigated and processed.\n\nAccording to him, out of the N508 billion premium generated in 2020, claims on matured risks amounted to N224 billion.\n\n\u201cMerely looking at this figure you can see that claims took almost 50 percent of the income generated, so we are standing strong with our customers, the NIA boss stated.\n\nA further breakdown on the EndSARS released earlier by the NIA showed that 99 claims were settled on malicious damage; 8 claims on business interruption; 455 claims on burglary attacks and 912 claims on fire and burnt sites.\n\nFollowing huge losses suffered by businesses during #EndSARS, NIA said that the insurance industry, in line with its role of providing financial intermediation and restoring businesses, quickly moved in to provide the necessary cushion for those that have insurance covers.\n\nYetunde Ilori, director-general of the NIA, while assuring Nigerians that the insurance industry will continue to live up to its mandate of supporting businesses, she called on individuals and corporate entities to imbibe the culture of insurance.\n\nDuring the protests that took place in October 2020, government offices, banks, shopping malls, media houses, toll plazas and private offices and shops suffered losses following the activities of suspected hoodlums who hijacked the exercise.\n\nMeanwhile, experts at Allianz Nigeria in a recent report to mark the first anniversary of the EndSARS protest observed that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) were usually faced with financial challenges, which constantly affect their operations and sometimes lead to their closure.\n\nAccording to them, in the wake of the one-year anniversary of the #EndSARS protests, it is important to re-emphasise the importance of insurance to the MSME industry and the Nigerian economy at large.\n\n\u201cIn its aftermath, statistics revealed a loss of confidence in the economy by foreign investors as franchises such as Shoprite/SPAR were badly affected. This resulted in job losses, further worsening the unemployment crisis in the country.\n\nAccording to Allianz, banks who gave out loans were badly affected, as loans to affected businesses had to be written off. Not only did several states groan under the financial strain of rebuilding damaged public assets, a good number of MSME\u2019s without insurance are yet to return, one year afterwards, the insurer said.\n\nWe support SME\u2019s by providing periodic risk analysis of the operating environment. This is highlighted in the Allianz Risk Barometer results, which is published yearly, the insurer said.",

          "text": "The rally in oil prices is not translating to more dollars in Nigeria\u2019s reserves for only the fifth time in at least two decades, as a growing petrol subsidy bill and low oil production shut Africa\u2019s largest oil producer from the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nNigeria\u2019s gross official reserves slipped below the $40 billion mark to $39.982 billion on February 3, the lowest in three months, according to data obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) website.\n\nThe reserves had also declined in the month of January 2022, falling by $481 million to $40.04 billion from $40.50 billion as of the end of December 2021.\n\nThere has been no significant boost for the reserves since last September when Nigeria issued a $5 billion Eurobond and received a $3.3 billion Special Drawing Right (SDR) allocation from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIt is unusual for Nigeria\u2019s external reserves to be declining at a time the price of oil has rallied to the highest level since 2014, which should mean more dollar income for oil-exporting Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s external reserves and excess crude account tend to see accretion in periods of higher oil prices. But that tradition is increasingly fading.\n\nRead also: Oil price uncertainty, insecurity, threaten Nigeria\u2019s economic outlook \u2013 IMF\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, has risen by 14.6 percent this year alone to $90.5 per barrel, well above the government\u2019s target of $62 per barrel. While oil prices have soared, the external reserves have however declined by 1.3 percent in the same period.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s reserves are steadily declining due to poor oil revenues,\u201d Tunde Abidoye, an analyst at Lagos-based investment bank, FBN Quest, says in a note to clients. Nigeria\u2019s oil revenues have tanked for two reasons.\n\nFirst is the rising cost of subsidising petrol, a wasteful practice the government has stuck with in violation of a law it set itself \u2013 the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). The subsidy payment leaves the state-owned oil company, NNPC, with less cash to remit to the federation account.\n\nBen Akabueze, head of the country\u2019s Budget Office, said oil revenue had been affected negatively by subsidy costs and low oil production despite rising oil prices.\n\n\u201cThe oil sector let the government down (in 2021) with oil revenue coming 50 percent short of the target despite oil prices significantly higher than the budget benchmark,\u201d Akabueze said during the Renaissance Capital Market recap and Outlook for 2022.\n\n\u201cThis was largely due to the effects of unbudgeted fuel subsidy and oil production below even our OPEC quota,\u201d Akabueze said.\n\nThe government\u2019s oil revenues look set to turn out even worse this year with a subsidy bill that is estimated by the NNPC to increase to N3 trillion.",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) has hailed Monday\u2019s Federal High Court judgement affirming Muhammad Bello Matawalle as the Governor of Zamfara State.\n\nA statement signed by the national secretary, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, on Tuesday, said the ruling party commended the Judiciary for defending the Constitution and Matawalle\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the National Chairman of the APC National Caretaker Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, the Party hails the Judiciary for again defending the Constitution and the popular mandate of Alh. Bello Muhammad Matawalle as the Governor of Zamfara State.\n\nA Federal High Court in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, had on Monday dismissed the suit challenging Matawalle\u2019s governorship of Zamfara State upon his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the APC, saying the whole case was \u201cdevoid of merit\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBased on Monday\u2019s judgement, the Honourable Court held that there is no provision in the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which states that a Governor will lose his seat whenever he defects to another Party other than the political party upon which he was elected.\n\n\u201cThat Governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle has the right to assembly and association with respect to joining or belonging to a political party. In exercise of his right of freedom of association guaranteed under section 40 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), he can defect to any party of his choice and still maintain his seat as the Governor of Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThe APC congratulates Governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle on his affirmation by the High Court. The development will undoubtedly buoy Governor Matawalle\u2019s administration to continue implementing the many socio-economic development plans for Zamfara State as well as contribute towards efforts to tackle security challenges in the North West,\u201d Akpanudoedehe stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "A boost has been given to the campaign to push up the minimum educational qualification for certain political offices by the House of Representatives, which on Tuesday okayed a constitution alteration Bill on the issue at the second reading level.\n\nSponsor of the bill, Otunba Adewunmi Onanuga, said her suggested offices to be affected if enacted would be that of the president, governorship of a state, membership of the National Assembly, and that of state Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cHonourable Colleagues, all the political offices affected by this amendment are very strategic in their own right. The State legislators are important for making laws to govern the State in the interest of the people, the office of the Governor is the highest political office in the State. The Federal legislators are important for making laws in the interest of the nation, the Office of the President is the highest political office in the land.\n\n\u201cIf a Managing Director who holds an equally strategic position in a company within this country, cannot be employed without a university degree or its equivalent, why should the above political offices be held by people without a university degree or its equivalent?\u201d, the lawmaker argued as she presented the general principles of the bill before her colleagues.\n\nAccording to her, if signed into law, the bill will among other things, place more value on education in our nation and its importance when considering politics.\n\n\u201cAs we have begun to see, the race for elective offices at both State and national levels have become increasingly competitive. While this is good as a tenet of universal suffrage, it can also be counterproductive if people who are not sufficiently prepared educationally, get into these elective offices.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Bill targeted at stifling the interest of Nigerians in politics, rather it is a Bill that will help Nigerians to sufficiently prepare for the humongous task of political leadership.\n\n\u201cWe all know that after a university degree or its equivalent in this country, comes the compulsory National Youth Service Corp, without which it would be difficult to get into any employment especially within the Public Sector. Invariably, by leaving the qualification of this political offices to remain at School Certificate level, we are implying that the NYSC is not a requirement to hold political offices but it is a requirement to secure a job in the Public Sector.\n\n\u201cThis Bill, will reflect the premium this 9th Assembly places on the quality of education that interests our youths vis-\u00e0-vis their desired political ambitions; and it will in turn affect the quality of candidates who run for elective offices in this country. Otherwise, how do we place value on education if I say to my son who wants to be a doctor that he needs a university degree or its equivalent to achieve his dream and then say to my daughter who wants to be a President someday that she only needs to have a School Certificate?\u201d, she argued.",

          "text": "\n\nThe Independent National Election Commission (INEC), has stated that Thursday 10th February 2022, sensitive materials for the Area Council election would be delivered by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to the commission\u2019s FCT office in Garki while the non sensitive materials have already been delivered.\n\nAccording to INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu on Tuesday at a stakeholders meeting in Abuja prelude to the FCT polls, party agents, observers and the media would be invited to inspect the materials before they would be moved to the Area Councils the same day.\n\nHe stated that security personnel would provide escort to the Area Councils and protection of the materials until they reach the polling units on election day.\n\nHe said accredited 58 observer groups (53 domestic and 5 foreign) that are deploying a total of 2,242 field observers.\n\nSimilarly, the commission said it has accredited 45 media organisations deploying 340 journalists to cover the election, adding that it would work with the security agencies to ensure that observers and the media are granted unimpeded access to voting and collation locations.\n\nThe INEC chairman called on the media and observers to operate within the context of the code of conduct for election observation and media coverage.\n\nYakubu reiterated that voter inducement in all forms, including vote-buying at polling units, is a violation of the law, adding that the ban on the use of mobile phones and other photographic devices in the voting cubicles is still in force.\n\n\u201cI would like to assure all stakeholders that the Commission will protect the transparency and integrity of the process. In line with this commitment, we have accredited 58 observer groups (53 domestic and 5 foreign) that are deploying a total of 2,242 field observers. We have similarly accredited 45 media organisations deploying 340 journalists to cover the election.\n\n\u201cWe will work with the security agencies to ensure that observers and the media are granted unimpeded access to voting and collation locations. I call upon the media and observers to operate within the context of the code of conduct for election observation and media coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is also deploying six Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) to support the REC for the FCT and three National Commissioners to supervise the conduct of the election. Our eyes are on all our officials, be they ad hoc or regular staff, to ensure that they strictly abide by the rules.\n\n\u201cAll parties, candidates and their supporters should do the same. No one will benefit from the disruption of the process or other acts of bad behaviour. Let the voters in the FCT choose their leaders in a free, fair and peaceful contest.\n\n\u201cI would like to reiterate that voter inducement in all forms, including vote-buying at polling units, is a violation of the law. The ban on the use of mobile phones and other photographic devices in the voting cubicles is still in force.\u201d\n\nOn other preparations for the area council polls, Prof Yakubu said: \u201cThe commission has published the final list of 473 candidates sponsored by 14 political parties for the elections. In all, 110 candidates (Chair and Vice Chair) are vying for the leadership of the six Area Councils while 363 candidates are competing for 62 councillorship positions.\n\n\u201cWith only four days to the election, most of the major activities have been carried out. Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) was conducted over a period of six months. Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) have been printed and made available for collection.\n\n\u201cThere are enough ad hoc staff engaged and trained for the election. Non-sensitive materials have been deployed to the various Area Councils. Non-pharmaceutical materials have been procured to protect voters and personnel from COVID-19 in line with the Commission\u2019s policy based on the protocols prescribed by health authorities.\n\n\u201cVoter education and publicity have been carried out. Transport arrangements have been made, including motorcycles for remote locations and boats for riverine areas. We shall deploy assistive devices such as Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses for the physically challenged voters.\n\n\u201cWe had several meetings with the security agencies in the area councils, the FCT and the national level on how to address potential threats to the election and secure the election. All non-sensitive materials have already been delivered to the Area Councils.\n\n\u201cWith regard to election technology for voter accreditation, the Commission has reviewed the performance of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) in the recent Anambra State Governorship election. Lessons learnt from that election have been considered in planning for the Area Council elections.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS have been configured and ready to deploy for the election. We have also made adequate arrangements for technical support and transportation to speedily respond in the unlikely event of glitches on Election Day.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, election results will be uploaded to the INEC Result Viewing portal (IReV) in real-time when voting ends and votes are counted at polling units on Election Day.\u201d\n\n1",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday conferred the Nigerian National Order of Merit (NNOM) for years 2020 and 2021 on three Nigerian scholars.\n\nThe scholars had distinguished themselves in the field of medicine and science.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by presidential spokesperson Femi Adesina, the President also expressed belief that Nigeria\u2019s collective future rests on active participation in science and technology.\n\nThe scholars include Dr. Oluyinka Olurotimi Olutoye, Medicine (2020); the late Professor Charles Ejike Chidume, Science (2020) and Professor Godwin O. Samuel Ekhaguere, Science (2021).\n\n\u201dPlease endeavour, at all times, to serve as beacons of hope and aspiration for the younger generation of Nigerians, reminding them that our survival and collective future as a nation ultimately rests on our being active participants in global developmental efforts, especially in science and technology,\u201d the President told the recipients, as quoted in Mr. Adesina\u2019s statement.\n\nThe President noted that since the Nigerian National Merit Award (NNMA) was established 43 years ago, the addition of the three recipients would bring the total number of recipients to only 79, confirming the high standards of the Award and undeniable testimony of the strict adherence to quality and the merit-driven evaluation procedure for selecting laureates.\n\nHe added that the integrity of the Award also underscores the high expectations of the nation that the new recipients, like their predecessors, would continue to hold the banners of creativity and intellectual excellence very high.\n\nWhile congratulating the three awardees, the President expressed the government\u2019s appreciation for the patience of the 2020 Award winners, who had to wait close to two years to receive their Award due to the emergence of Covid-19 in 2020.\n\nThe president recounted that the total lockdown of the country, in 2020, made it difficult for the assessment process to hold then but was later held concurrently last year alongside with the 2021 applications.\n\nRecognising families, friends, associates and well-wishers, who were present at the Council Chambers in State House to share the joy of the awardees, the President enjoined youths in the country to emulate the good works of the laureates by dedicating themselves to \u201dexcellence and strive to contribute their quota to the arduous task of getting Nigeria on the top bracket of outstanding nations.\u201d\n\nThe President also congratulated members of the Governing Board of the NNMA under the Chairmanship of Prof. Shekarau Yakubu Aku, as well as members of the Four Specialized Committees of Assessors and External Assessors for their integrity and transparency, and for the excellent work they have done.\n\n\u201dThe noble idea of constituting the Assessors Committees, whose membership is not disclosed to the public, ensures credibility that could be emulated by other Government Agencies performing similar functions.\n\n\u201dThe fact that transparency and love for the Nation have been the hallmark of your stewardship is well borne out by the fact that the NNOM Award is one of the enduring national legacies that are held in high regard globally and nationally and your decisions have been well acclaimed and controversy-free over the years.\n\n\u201dLet me assure you that the Government and People of Nigeria appreciate your efforts and I enjoin you all to keep up the good work.\u201d\n\nOn the request of the Chairman of the Governing Board over the dwindling budgetary allocation to the Agency and how it is constraining the agency in carrying out its mandatory functions, President Buhari promised that the Federal Government would provide special intervention as was done in year 2020 to the NNMA, within limited resources available.\n\nAcknowledging the focal place that NNMA occupy and the calibre of all laureates produced by the Agency, the President assured that the Federal Government would do everything possible to maintain and sustain the Agency.\n\n\u201dI wish to reassure you that this Administration is fully committed to giving the NNMA the recognition that it deserves, by immortalizing its recipients who have taken this country to greater heights both in Nigeria and in the Diaspora.\n\n\u201dWe are a nation keen on fostering excellence across board and we will continue to celebrate those who have attained measurable levels of excellence in their professional life, \u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Sen. George Akume said the three intellectuals emerged winners for the 2020 and 2021 Award after the selection process, from the over 1,200 applications received by the NNOM Governing Board during the period under consideration.\n\n\u201dIt is important to state that Prof Charles Ejike Chidume died after he was selected and recommended for approval to Mr. President and he will be given the award posthumously,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister called on Nigerian universities to rise up to the challenge and continue to lead in innovative research targeted at providing solutions to the myriad of problems affecting the country, especially post COVID-19 era.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman NNMA Governing Board, Prof Aku announced that recipients of the prestigious award bestowed by Nigeria on its citizens for creative, intellectual and academic contributions that are of national and global importance receive a cash reward of N10 million each.\n\nThe recipients of the award are divided into four areas- Medicine, Science, Engineering and Technology, and the Humanities, including Education and Culture, Prof Aku said.\n\nAbridged citation of recipients\n\nProf Olutoye, recipient of the 2020 NNOM Award for science, is credited to have led a team which performed ground-breaking surgical procedures on foetuses before they are born.\n\nIn 2016, in a feat that has been hailed as the first by an African, he performed a surgical procedure on a foetus with sacrococcygeal teratoma, which is a tumour that develops before birth and grows from a baby\u2019s tailbone.\n\nOlutoye received his medical degree at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife) in 1988 with distinctions in anatomy and pathology, interned at the Lagos State University, before proceeding to the United States for specialised training in surgery.\n\nHe is currently the Surgeon-in-Chief at the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, United States.\n\nProf Chidume, recipient of the 2020 NNOM posthumous Award for science, was the Acting President of the African University of Science and Technology, Abuja before his demise on October 7, 2021.\n\nThe works of the globally renowned Professor of Mathematics encompass several fields including Nonlinear Functional Analysis, Nonlinear Operator Theory and Differential Equations, Nonlinear Optimisation.\n\nHe bagged his bachelor\u2019s degree in Mathematics from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in 1973, M.Sc in Mathematics in 1977 from the Queen\u2019s University Kingston, Ontario, Canada and Ph.D in Mathematics from the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.\n\nProf Ekhaguere, recipient of the 2021 NNOM Award for science, is a professor of Mathematical Physics.\n\nHe created and pioneered the theory of Quantum Stochastic Differential Inclusion (QSDIs) that has greatly improved the entire Science Community\u2019s understanding of those pathological quantum systems whose governing equation involves discontinuous coefficient.\n\nProf Ekhaguere holds a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Physics from the University of Ibadan, 1971, DIC in Mathematics Physics from Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, UK in 1974 and Ph.D. in Mathematics Physics from University of London (Bedford College), London, UK in 1976.",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday said democracy and social justice are vital structures required for nation building, because the pursuit of justice lies at the heart of the quest for a better society.\n\nHe made the comment at the 53rd Conference of the National Association of Law Teachers, held at Bayero University, Kano (BUK), with the theme: \u201cLaw, Democracy and the Electoral Process.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement signed by presidential spokesperson Laolu Akande, after attending the conference, the Vice President decided to pay a condolence visit to the family of the kidnapped and murdered Kano pupil, Hanifa Abubakar at Yankaba, Dakata Junction, off Hadejia road, Kano State.\n\nREAD ALSO: Blackish Substance Found In Sylvester Oromoni\u2019s Intestine \u2013 Pathologist\n\nThe Vice President, accompanied by Kano State Governor, Alhaji Abdullahi Ganduje, some members of the National Assembly, including Sen. Kabiru Gaya, among others, were received at the residence of the slain schoolgirl, by her father, Alhaji Abubakar Abdulsalam.\n\nDuring the visit, prayers were offered for the departed and the VP expressed condolences on behalf of the President and himself to the family, especially the deceased mother, Murjanatu, and the father, both of whom were present at the visitation.\n\nOn his part, Alhaji Abubakar, father of the slain schoolgirl, expressed gratitude to the President and the Vice President for the visit and the condolences to his family over the killing of his daughter.\n\nThe visibly emotional father of the deceased, who summoned courage to speak to the press described the Vice President\u2019s visit as an honour to his entire family, praying for God\u2019s blessings on the President, the VP and for peace in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI am rather speechless, I don\u2019t have enough words to quantify my joy and gratitude over the visit of the Vice President to my family to condole me.\n\n\u201cAs I told him, it should be the other way round, the Vice President is our father; we are supposed to go and pay him a visit, not him coming to us. However, I am grateful, I am sincerely honoured. The only thing I will say is to pray for him and the entire nation, that peace will reign.\u201d\n\nWhile declaring the conference opened earlier, Prof. Osinbajo noted that democracy and social justice are closely linked, adding that the cornerstone of democracy is the insistence that \u201cour society must be governed by the rule of law and not the whim of man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs law teachers and legal practitioners, we are custodians of this truth. However, democracy cannot endure without social justice,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cthe pursuit of justice lies at the heart of the quest for the good of society.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis makes the legal profession one of the cardinal vocations upon which civilization rests. Indeed, law is an instrument of pacific social engineering, the end of which is justice. When it is rooted in this postulate, it follows that the law and therefore democracy, are meant to serve beneficial social ends.\u201d\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201ca society in which an increasing number of people consider themselves alienated from legal institutions or perceive these legal institutions to be incapable of delivering justice for all cannot be stable and prosperous.\u201d\n\nWithout social justice, legal justice is ultimately unattainable, Prof. Osinbajo stated, adding that \u201cour idea of social justice also refers to the social and economic rights of the people.\u201d\n\nHe said these rights, according to the Constitution, include the right to food, shelter, employment, education and a reasonable national minimum living wage, care for the elderly, pensions, unemployment benefits and welfare for the physically challenged.\n\n\u201cThe degree to which citizens are in possession of their social and economic rights has a direct impact on the degree of their access to legal services and, thence, to justice. Our concern as teachers and practitioners of the law, therefore, must extend beyond the courtroom, beyond the precincts of our legal institutions, to the social reality in which these structures exist.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on government\u2019s role in ensuring growth of democracy and social justice in society, the Vice President noted that \u201cthe principle of the dignity of the human person implies that governments must be considerate, egalitarian and universal in the sense that they must serve everyone.\u201d\n\nAgain, he stated that this cardinal principle was a major reason for the Federal Government\u2019s Social Investment Programmes.\n\nThe VP said the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts in social welfare and expanding universal health insurance to ensure \u201cthat our most vulnerable citizens are not abandoned to the vicissitudes of fate.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the essence of democracy and the need to preserve democratic institutions in Nigeria and other parts of Africa, the Vice President noted that even as Nigeria has enjoyed 22 years of unbroken democracy, the country is still a young democracy.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed a series of peaceful transitions of power. This is a huge credit to the democratic sensibilities of our people. Along the way, we are learning valuable lessons that can only make us better practitioners of liberty.\n\n\u201cMany of our institutions are still in their infancy, and we must carefully guide them into maturity. We recognize that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo observed.\n\nHe noted that the Electoral Bill now in process is testament to the Administration\u2019s commitment towards improving Nigeria\u2019s electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe Bill itself has been the subject of robust engagement between the government and civil society. While some have expressed reservations about the time it is taking to enact the new law, we should remember that a truly inclusive democratic, deliberative process often takes time. I am confident that the legislation that emerges will be one that reflects a broad consensus between all the stakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Vice President added that \u201cwhile INEC continues to improve its capacity to conduct credible elections, particularly through the deployment of technology; we recognize that democracy is about much more than voting. It is also about constitutionalism, rule of law and respect for civil liberties. We must diligently work to uphold these principles.\n\n\u201cOur progress as a democracy must therefore also be prosecuted in terms of the struggle to reduce the basic problems of ill-health, malnutrition, illiteracy, and famine which daily afflict our people. Where social and economic rights are unsecured, people are unable to fully maximize their civil and political rights.\u201d",

          "text": "Ex-pope Benedict XVI asked for forgiveness Tuesday for clerical child sex abuse committed on his watch, but aides rejected allegations of a cover-up while he was archbishop of Munich.\n\n\u201cI can only express to all the victims of sexual abuse my profound shame, my deep sorrow and my heartfelt request for forgiveness,\u201d the 94-year-old said in a letter published by the Vatican.\n\nThe letter from the former pontiff \u2014 who stepped down in 2013 \u2014 was released in response to a German inquiry last month that criticised his handling of cases involving paedophile priests in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cI have had great responsibilities in the Catholic Church. All the greater is my pain for the abuses and the errors that occurred in those different places during the time of my mandate,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHowever, organisations representing abuse victims criticised the lack of specifics in his comments.\n\nGerman group Eckiger Tisch said Benedict continued a Catholic Church tradition of declaring that \u201cthere were acts and faults, but no one takes concrete responsibility\u201d.\n\nLast month\u2019s German investigation accused the former pope of knowingly failing to stop four priests accused of child sex abuse when he was archbishop of Munich between 1977 and 1982.\n\nBenedict, who is in frail health, asked a team of aides to help him respond to the lengthy findings by law firm Westpfahl Spilker Wastl (WSW), charged by the archdiocese of Munich and Freising to examine abuse between 1945 and 2019.\n\nThe aides insisted in an accompanying statement Tuesday that \u201cas an archbishop, Cardinal Ratzinger was not involved in any cover-up of acts of abuse\u201d, using the pope\u2019s birth name, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nNot Aware\n\nIn one case, a now-notorious paedophile priest named Peter Hullermann was transferred to Munich from Essen in western Germany where he had been accused of abusing an 11-year-old boy.\n\nBenedict\u2019s team has already admitted to unintentionally giving incorrect information to the report authors when they denied his attendance at a meeting about Hullermann in 1980.\n\nBut they denied any decision had been taken at that meeting about reassigning the priest to pastoral duties, and on Tuesday said the abuse had not been discussed.\n\n\u201cIn none of the cases analysed by the expert report was Joseph Ratzinger aware of sexual abuse committed or suspicion of sexual abuse committed by priests. The expert report provides no evidence to the contrary,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn his letter, Benedict expressed hurt that the \u201coversight\u201d over his attendance at the 1980 meeting \u201cwas used to cast doubt on my truthfulness, and even to label me a liar\u201d.\n\nBenedict, who lives in a former monastery within the Vatican walls, said he was grateful \u201cfor the confidence, support and prayer that Pope Francis personally expressed to me\u201d.\n\nFrancis has said nothing in public although the Vatican defended Benedict last month, noting his meetings with abuse victims and introduction of laws to combat paedophilia.\n\nFear and Trembling\n\nBefore becoming pope, Benedict led the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal congregation, giving him ultimate responsibility to investigate abuse cases.\n\nIn his letter, he spoke of \u201cconfession\u201d, saying that every day, he asked himself whether he was guilty of \u201ca most grievous fault\u201d, using the phrase said during confession at Mass.\n\n\u201cIn all my meetings\u2026 with victims of sexual abuse by priests, I have seen at first hand the effects of a most grievous fault,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI have come to understand that we ourselves are drawn into this grievous fault whenever we neglect it or fail to confront it with the necessary decisiveness and responsibility, as too often happened and continues to happen.\u201d\n\nBut his comments fell short of what the SNAP survivors network said was required.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity for cleansing (that) the report out of Munich offered has been squandered,\u201d it said, condemning Benedict\u2019s \u201clack of candour\u201d.\n\nBenedict finished his letter observing that \u201cquite soon, I shall find myself before the final judge of my life\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs I look back on my long life, I can have great reason for fear and trembling,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut he was nevertheless \u201cof good cheer\u201d as he prepared to \u201cpass confidently through the dark door of death\u201d.",

          "text": "Following the supply of a wrong specification of petrol in some parts of the country, and its subsequent removal in compliance with a government order, long queues have once more returned to petrol stations in Abuja, parts of Lagos, and some other states.\n\nIndications emerged on Monday that the current challenge being faced in the supply of petrol in some states was as a result of the directive to withdraw adulterated products from circulation.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the shortage of supply from the sole importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), had worsened the situation.\n\nIn Abuja and surrounding states, majority of filling stations were shut and motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open, and causing serious traffic jams in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) blamed the shortage of supply on issues surrounding the presence of bad fuel in the market as well as undersupply from the national oil company.\n\nThe particular cargo with the product was said to have high sulphur, while marketers were advised not to sell to consumers, with at least 100 million litres already in circulation at the time the bad fuel was discovered.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the queues returned partly because the gap, which existed when depot owners started hoarding products before the announcement of retention of subsidy by the federal government, had not smoothened. This has affected the lifting of the products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\n\nThe federal government had backtracked on its plan to remove fuel subsidy in mid-2022, citing the need to protect the poor and vulnerable.\n\nMany of the fuel stations visited, including Eterna and Enyo on Olusegun Obasanjo Way in Wuse as well as Total on Herbert Macaulay, did not have product and more than half of the fuel pumps at the NNPC mega station in the area were not operational.\n\nSouth-West Zonal Chairman of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Dele Tajudeen, who confirmed the existence of contaminated fuel in circulation while speaking on a national television yesterday, absolved the organisation of any blame. Tajudeen explained that that IPMAN members had suffered severe losses and may ask for damages from the authorities.\n\nAccording to him, members of his group were supplied with bad products, which had put them in serious trouble, as they had to repair vehicles for their customers whose cars were impacted by the bad product.\n\nStressing that fuel station owners are now rejecting the bad product, he explained that the group was working to resolve the issue amicably with NNPC\u2019s subsidiary, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC).\n\n\u201cWe need to be compensated, but we don\u2019t want to put the masses in another crisis if we resort to going on strike, demanding compensation because we know people are already in a deep economic problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IPMAN official assured that the issue of bad fuel in circulation was already being investigated, stating that Managing Director of PPMC, Mr Isiaku Abdullahi, was intervening in the matter.\n\n\u201cUntil the investigation is concluded, I don\u2019t want to comment more, so as not to pre-empt it, but Mr Abdullahi is making efforts to ensure that all the depots are revived. He is doing a holistic rehabilitation of the depots,\u201d he said.\n\nTajudeen added, \u201cThis (fuel scarcity) is as a result of short supply from the NNPC and, of course, the private depots around Lagos. One of the major reasons for the scarcity is that the five NNPC depots in southwest as at today are not loading products.\n\n\u201cAlso, we witnessed the issue of bad product and I must use this opportunity to tell the masses that it is not from our members. As a matter of fact we suffered serious loss of cash and integrity because we received the product from the private depots.\n\n\u201cAs I am telling you, we have run into millions of naira in losses as a result of this bad product. So, the station owners are not responsible for these product.\u201d\n\nTajudeen commended Abdullahi for his efforts at ameliorating the situation, describing him as proactive. He said most of their customers had been complaining, prompting them to carry out repairs, replacement of the bad fuels and bearing the reputational damage caused by the situation.\n\nHe pointed out, \u201cThe situation is not too good because of non-availability of this product, coupled with this bad product that came in the last two weeks. The products are being rejected now. So, because of that, there\u2019s shortage of product.\u201d\n\nOn the rising cost of diesel, Tajudeen stated that while the product had gone to N401 without the logistics costs, petrol has gone to N156 without transport costs, saying it will then hit N162 to N163 before it gets do the stations. \u201cOur profit margin has been eroded completely,\u201d he lamented.\n\nBut he argued that government could not leave pricing in private hands because it will \u201cstrangulate the masses\u201d, adding that the international crude oil prices does not necessarily tally with the rise in prices in the country.\n\nA top NNPC official who spoke with THISDAY on the matter, stated that whatever the situation, it was the responsibility of the new downstream/midstream authority to speak on the matter.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThey (the queues) will disappear. It\u2019s just a small supply gap. People are bound to make all sorts of speculations, but if the speculation continues, the downstream/midstream authority will come up with a statement to clarify whatever is happening.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a civil advocacy group yesterday called on the federal government to take a decisive action against those alleged to be hoarding petrol in the country, and subjection unbearable hardship on the masses.\n\nThe group, in a letter to the Minister of State for Petroleum and Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), specifically accused members of independent marketers of petroleum products of hoarding fuel, which according to them, was responsible for the long queues at fuel stations across the country, particularly the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and its environs.\n\nThe letter dated February 7, 2022, and signed by the group\u2019s Convener, Mr. Deji Adeyanju, was titled, \u201cPersistent Hoarding of Fuel By Independent Marketers: A Call for Urgent Action.\u201d\n\nIt said, \u201cAs you may already know, in recent months independent marketers of petroleum products have engaged in speculative acts of hoarding petroleum products, particularly PMS, in a bid to criminally increase the prices, cause artificial scarcity and plunge the country into widespread economic chaos.\n\n\u201cFor example, filing stations across the nation\u2019s capital are littered with long queues of vehicles seeking to purchase fuel, while the independent marketers ensured that their filing stations were shut for the day by 6pm.\u201d\n\nThe group, however, lamented that the regulators had not deemed it necessary to call these independent marketers to order, as they had continued to allow them take advantage of Nigerians.\n\nThe convener expressed pain that the development was causing excruciating pain on the people, adding that an artificial fuel scarcity is the last thing they should worry about.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is equally important to point out that causing artificial scarcity resulting in economic sabotage is a criminal offence under our laws.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must, therefore, put a halt to the ball watching and take urgent steps to address the economic sabotage, especially as there is no reason for artificial scarcity at this time.\n\n\u201cSequel to the foregoing, we call on the federal government to arrest the offending marketers, shut their filling stations and bring this on-going economic sabotage to an end. Nigerians deserves to buy fuel at an accessible rate anytime.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and Alex Enumah in Abuja",
          "summary": "This has affected the lifting of the products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\nThe IPMAN official assured that the issue of bad fuel in circulation was already being investigated, stating that Managing Director of PPMC, Mr Isiaku Abdullahi, was intervening in the matter.\n\u201cAlso, we witnessed the issue of bad product and I must use this opportunity to tell the masses that it is not from our members.\n\u201cAs I am telling you, we have run into millions of naira in losses as a result of this bad product.\nHe pointed out, \u201cThe situation is not too good because of non-availability of this product, coupled with this bad product that came in the last two weeks.",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Leaders in Search of Consensus Candidate at Convention",
          "text": "With the February 26 National Convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) inching closer, leaders and stakeholders of the party, particularly, governors, ministers, and members of the National Assembly, are searching for a consensus candidate that would lead the party to the general election in 2023.\n\nA reliable source told THISDAY that President Muhammadu Buhari had consonant views, and that he actually handed down the option of a consensus candidate for national chairman before jetting out to Ethiopia to attend the African Union (AU) meeting last week. The president returned to the country yesterday.\n\nAmong those being considered for the post of national chairman, a source further hinted, included former Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Bawa Bwari from Niger State, Saliu Mustapha from Kwara State, and Senator Tanko Al-Makura from Nasarawa State.\n\nThese three prospective candidates were allegedly mentioned repeatedly by many of the major stakeholders of the party as suitable to lead the APC to a successful election in 2023.\n\nFollowing media reports that APC was considering fielding former President Goodluck Jonathan as its presidential candidate in 2023, the ruling party said defectors to the party, including Jonathan, would be given waiver to contest.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the APC stakeholders were informed that in their search for a consensus candidate for national chairman, \u201cThey should put into considerations factors, like energy, credibility, experience, and ability to drive and sustain the winning streak of the party in the next general election.\u201d\n\nAccording to a northern governor, who pleaded anonymity, \u201cThe president had informed us that the only way he would be part of the much talked about idea of a consensus national chairman is for the stakeholders to ensure that whosoever that will emerge meets certain irreducible leadership criteria, chief of which are character and credibility factors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the ruling party was considering adopting the consensus option to avoid the crisis that could follow the election of a national chairman, bearing in mind that the national convention was around the corner.\n\nThe source explained that though \u201cthe office of the national chairman has not been officially zoned to any of the geopolitical zones in the north, in principle, the party may yield to the agitations of the stakeholders of the party from the North-central zone.\u201d\n\nThe source explained further that at several meetings of the APC governors with the party\u2019s National Assembly members as well as members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the three aspirants from the North-central had been consistently mentioned.\n\nBwari was Minister of State for Mines and Steel from 2015 to 2019. He was also Chief Whip in the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2007.\n\nMustapha was Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive change (CPC), Buhari\u2019s legacy party before the merger that birthed APC. He was also Organising Secretary of the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) at some point.\n\nAl-Makura, a serving senator, was governor of Nasarawa State.\n\nWhile Mustapha and Al-Makura had long declared their intentions and embarked on rigorous campaigns across the country, Bwari was yet to officially declare his intention at the time of filing this report.\n\nMustapha and Al-Makura also appear to enjoy the full and open backing of their governors, Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and Abdulahi Sule, respectively.\n\nTHISDAY was told that the stakeholders might have drafted the three names for possible security screening to avoid selecting anyone with the baggage of controversies as national chairman.\n\nBarring any further delays, the outcome of the security profiling of the three might form the basis of the choice that would be sent to the president early next week.\n\nAccording to the source, the security profiling was discretely undertaken to avoid any embarrassment to the ruling party.\n\nThough it was gathered that two former governors \u2013 Abduallahi Yari of Zamfara and Modu Sheriff of Borno State \u2013 were still protesting adoption of a consensus option, the source said their protest might not hold water since the president had bought into the idea.\n\nIn the same vein, two aspirants for national secretary from Anambra State, Ambassador Jerry Sunny Ugokwe and Nze Chidi Duru, may emerge. The implication is that the office of National Secretary may have been zoned to the South-east.\n\nMeanwhile, following media reports and on-going permutations that APC was considering fielding Jonathan as its presidential candidate in 2023, the ruling party reiterated that defectors to the party would be given waiver to contest.\n\nJonathan had of late been paying visits to Buhari in Aso Rock, and holding private discussions.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday by telephone, National Secretary of APC\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator James Akpanudoedehe, reiterated that anyone that defected to the party, by virtue of the December Resolution, would be given a waiver to contest, including the former president. Though Akpanudoedehe said he was not aware if the former president was planning to come to the party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said, \u201cGo back to my former reaction. I cannot bring out that topic again on the front burner. I cannot bring up that matter, because I actually answered that question about Goodluck Jonathan and I told Nigerians that anybody that comes into the party by the resolution of December has the right to contest.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that the caretaker committee has endorsed him; I am not aware that the caretaker has endorsed anybody. I\u2019m not aware that he (Jonathan) has been wooed to join the party. I am not privy to that.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, on Monday, disclosed that a prima facie case had been established against suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police Abba Kyari over allegations levelled against him by the United States government in the fraud case involving an internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly called Hushpuppi.\n\nMalami, who spoke during an interview on Channels Television, noted that multiple jurisdictions were involved in the matter, including the United Arab Emirates, America, and Nigeria. He added that though investigations were still on-going, the possibility of extraditing the officer was high.\n\nThe attorney general also claimed that the number of convictions the administration had so far secured in the fight against corruption clearly established that a recent report by Transparency International had no basis.\n\nMalami explained, \u201cThere are lots of considerations that are on-going, including the possibility of extradition and that is why the collaboration element comes in. There could be a need for extradition.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, parties are discussing; we are collaborating and there are exchanges of correspondence. Reasonable ground of suspicion has been established and that will eventually translate into prosecution and eventual conviction.\n\n\u201cThe position now is that there are prima facie grounds, reasonable grounds for suspicion have been considered from the perspective of prosecution, from the perspective of extradition if the need for it arises.\u201d\n\nMalami also addressed the question of terrorism sponsorship and assured Nigerians that nothing would be hidden in terms of names, associated facts, and circumstances.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWork is in progress and nobody has been taken to custody arbitrarily. In a couple of weeks, these people will be charged to court. In a number of weeks, we will have something tangible. I am a man of honour, not out of pride, but when I make promises, I keep to them.\u201d\n\nMalami rejected the Corruption Perceptions Index 2021, which ranked Nigeria 154 out of 180 countries and territories, putting the country back five places from the rank of 149 in 2020. He said before the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, Nigeria had only about 103 convictions in corruption cases between 2013 and 2014. He said the number had moved to 2,000 convictions in 2021 alone in cases brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nThe attorney general stated, \u201cToday, as of the end of 2021, EFCC has recorded over 2,000 convictions. So, if you are talking of the year in, year out empirical evidence as it relates to the performance of our institutions, one single institution (EFCC) has established the point that there is no basis by which Transparency International report can stand.\n\n\u201cWhen you juxtapose the report of the Transparency International with that of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which is more universal and are the best for assessment.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, when you are talking of Transparency International compared with United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), then, the answer as far as we are concerned is UNDOC stands clear.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has been commended and rated as the champion of anti-corruption established a point that there is no basis, no foundation, no justifiable ground and, indeed, to the standing platform upon which Transparency International could stand. We have been acknowledged to be doing very well by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\u201d\n\nThe minister insisted that the fight against corruption could only be assessed by the number of prosecutions and convictions, saying the fact that EFCC could records, over 2,000 convictions within a year showed that the present administration has done well in the fight against corruption.\n\nMalami also dwelt on the alleged delay in the prosecution of high profile cases, saying, \u201cAs far as the present administration is concerned, delay of cases does not arise. If you are looking at it from the perspective of the legislative framework, we are enforcing provisions of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, as in day-in-day-out prosecution of cases.\u201d\n\nCiting the the case of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, Malami stated that once the matter had been subjected to court, the delay in the prosecution could not be blamed on the presidency, adding that it is exclusively a judiciary affair.\n\n\u201cWe have taken steps to provide the legislative framework; we have taken steps in due diligence of prosecution of cases, which as a result of multiple convictions within a span of a year, is a clear pointer that we have indeed promised and delivered,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, on the case of former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, Malami said, \u201cIt\u2019s a work-in-progress,\u201d addeding, \u201cThe report of investigation, having been received, it is only logical to allow the agents of the government to do what they are supposed to do for the purpose of arriving at a certain position.\n\n\u201cThe idea of political persecution does not arise but due process. We allow the institutions to do the needful with a view to arriving at a final decision.\u201d\n\nOn money recovered at an Ikoyi building some years ago, Malami said, \u201cI have to refer back to record,\u201d stressing that, all the monies that had been forfeited to the federal government were part of the funds used to support the budget.\n\nMalami stated, \u201cIn our budgets of 2020, 2021, and 2022, we have a component of budget servicing that relates to recovered assets. So, if there has been a final forfeiture order relating to that money, it may have been applied to service the budget.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the failure to disclose names of those allegedly sponsoring terrorism, he said, \u201cPrima facie case or reasonable suspicion seems to have been established, eventually, prosecution will take place,\u201d assuring that nothing would be hidden in terms of names, associated facts, and circumstances.\n\nHe said, \u201dWork is in progress and nobody has been taken to custody arbitrarily. In a couple of weeks, these people will be charged to court. In a number of weeks, we will have something tangible. I am a man of honour, not out of pride, but when I make promises, I keep to them.\u201d\n\nThe issue of Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu also came up and the minister said, \u201cWe will allow the law of the country, where he (Igboho) is being detained to take its natural course. Perhaps, thereafter bring him back after the conclusion of his trial over there to face the Nigerian law that has been breached.\n\n\u201cWe are not interfering with his on-going prosecution at the foreign land. A political solution can only be considered after the conclusion of his trial at the Benin Republic. We cannot rule out any possibility in terms of prosecution. In our laws, there are lots of possibilities.\u201d\n\nMalami refrained from debating the Electoral law, saying it would be premature for him to comment on it, as a copy of the Amended Electoral Bill only got to his office yesterday (Monday).\n\nHe explained, \u201cI have not taken steps to review the content of what has been presented for consideration. So, it is premature and pre-emptive for me at this moment to arrive at any conclusion, taking into consideration that I have not seen what it contains and analysed it in accordance with the constitution.\n\n\u201cCertainly, if I am not satisfied and if I am of the opinion that it is against the public interest and against the dictates of the democratic process, I will advise accordingly. One thing I can tell you is that, we are all interested in leaving behind a legacy \u2013 a lasting democracy \u2013 a democracy that accommodates the collective interests of the Nigerian state and advances the national interest,\u201d he said.\n\nWale Igbindade",
