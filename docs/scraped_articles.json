He added that the COVID-19 vaccines were safe and good for the well-being of all.\n\nSaying the vaccines help to reduce the severity of ailment on whoever contracted the virus, he said; \u201cit is sad to note that some persons of influence have added untrue sentiments to the issue of COVID-19 vaccination which has created doubts and hesitancy in some persons and this is responsible for the low numbers of persons showing up for vaccination across the State.\n\n\u201cI took the vaccines, that is, both jabs and later came down with the virus which was very mild because of the vaccines I took earlier. Today, I am alive and healthy. so, those negative information being spread around will not help us as a people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 vaccine confers on one that immunity to confront the virus. Everyone should join and spread the information that COVIDd-19 vaccines are safe and all should take it as this will help reduce the severity of the virus when one contracts the virus\u201d.\n\nOn the enforcement of safety protocols to check the spread of the virus, he said; \u201cwe try as much as possible not to be punitive, but appeal to the good sense of judgment of Deltans and residents alike to apply themselves to what have been prescribed.\u201d\n\nOnonye said State Government had incorporated COVID-19 treatment in the treatment architecture in its health facilities, explaining that Deltans who registered with the State Contributory Health Scheme could get tested for the virus and treated free of charge.\n\nWhile calling on those in the informal sector that were yet to register with the scheme to do so with the sum N7,000, he said it would enable them to benefit from the scheme.\n\nEnjoining residents of the State to be more cautious, he said the Omicron variant spreads faster and most of the time those affected were asymptomatic. He, however, thanked\n\nGod that the state had not recorded any death in the wave of OMICRON variant.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2013As NASS transmits 2022 Appropriation Bill to Buhari next week\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamilla has debunked the report that members of the National Assembly especially the Green Chamber have started collecting signature to veto President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThere were criticisms as President Buhari declined to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill passed by the two chambers of the National Assembly and transmitted to him.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps pass 2022 Budget, raises expenditure to N17.1trn\n\nThe President faulted the issue of Direct Primaries that was contained in the bill, contending that it is the responsibility of political parties to decide the mode of conducting their primaries.\n\nSpeaking after meeting with President Buhari in his official residence on Thursday night, the Speaker said that the lower house has not collected signatures to override the President\u2019s decision to withhold assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any such threats to override the President\u2019s decision; at least not in my chambers. We\u2019re on a break right now. So, the collection of signatures is not something that is done when everybody\u2019s scattered.\n\n\u201cI made it abundantly clear at our last sitting that we will look at the President\u2019s veto and his reasons when we come back on. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re going to do on a knee jerk.\n\n\u201cWhen we come back from our recess, there\u2019s still ample time. We will decide one way or the other. We will do what is right for the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cAnd I made it very clear that we\u2019re not going to throw away the baby with the bathwater. And the electoral law is what a credible electoral process needs. And laws are what is required at this time. Nigerians want it and Nigerians will get it.\u201d\n\nThough he lamented that the house had tarried for a while, he affirmed that \u201cby the time we come back, at least as far as the house and I\u2019m sure the Senate as well, is concerned, it will be the first thing on our agenda. The very week we come back from recess\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan said that the recently-passed 2022 appropriation bill of 17.13tn will be transmitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for signing.next week.\n\nExplaining his purpose at the Villa, the Senate President said, \u201cMr President invited the Honourable Speaker and me to come so he could thank the National Assembly through us for working so hard to pass the 2022 Appropriation Bill, which will be brought to Mr. President for his assent by next week by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic. In fact, we\u2019re very sure that Mr President will sign the bill into an act of the National Assembly next week by the grace of God. And this is the way we should always work together. This is our third Appropriation Bill to be passed before we go on Christmas break.\n\n\u201cIt has shown how important the passage and the assent to the budget before the end of the year has been. You will recall that we were in two or three different recessions. But because public expenditure, which normally drives our economy, as a developing economy, has always brought that advantage, made the availability of funds into the economy. And we can come out of the recess periods.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to thank Mr President for thanking the National Assembly. This is essentially the reason why he invited the speaker and me to say to the National Assembly, thank you very much for working with us for making this budget 2022 pass in good time as you did for 2020 and 2021.\u201d",

          "title": "Christmas: Blackout looms in Lagos as five electricity towers collapse",
          "text": "At least, five electricity transmission towers collapsed on Friday in Lagos State.\n\nThis follows an inferno caused by a vandalized pipeline along Isheri Olofin, off Igando \u2013 LASU expressway of the state.\n\nThe fire caused massive damage to a 330kV Ikeja-West Akangba transmission line 1 and burnt off a large portion of the conductor.\n\nThis has led to total blackout in some parts of the state.\n\nAccording to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), the development triggered a resistant pull on the high-tension towers along the line route causing five of them to collapse.\n\nTCN\u2019s General Manager (Public Affairs), Ndidi Mbah, stated that, \u201cdue to the fact that the substation takes supply from two different 330kV transmission lines, with the second being the redundant line, TCN will rearrange bulk electricity transmitted on that line route to the second 330kV previously carrying 59MW.\n\n\u201cPresently, TCN is successfully back-feeding the substations affected by the towers collapse, while the engineers are patrolling the second 330kV transmission line which tripped as a result of the incident, to ensure it has no fault before it is energized. Once it is energized, supply will be restored to all the substations affected by the incident from the second 330kV transmission line, as the load carried by the burnt 330kV line will now be transferred to the second line.\n\n\u201cIncidents such as this is a major setback to TCN\u2019s concerted efforts in implementing its grid expansion and stability programme under its well-articulated Electricity Grid Maintenance, Expansion and Rehabilitation Programme. This is because the re-erection of five towers and restringing of the 330kV transmission line is a major project that costs a lot of money and will take a while to complete.\n\n\u201cTCN is by this appealing to Nigerians to desist from activities such as oil bunkering, and other destructive tendencies, as they all have very far-reaching negative effects on the nation at large. The issue of protecting our national assets is imperative and must be taken very seriously so that the stability of the nation\u2019s network and the development of the nation is not compromised.\u201d",

          "text": "Third Republic Senate President, Senator Ameh Ebute, has alleged that some serving Northern governors are festering insecurity in the region and across the country.\n\nEbute lamented that these governors and supposed leaders act as patriots during the day but are bandits and terrorists at night.\n\nThe former Senate President made the allegation in his Christmas message titled \u2018The gathering storm must not consume us\u2019.\n\nAccording to Ebute, the Christmas provides an opportunity for everyone not only to demonstrate love towards their families but to other fellow citizens irrespective of religion or ethnic affiliations.\n\nWhile calling for caution, Senator Ebute urged stakeholders to make peace building a reality in 2022 and not engage in acts that are capable of destroying the nation.\n\nAccording to Ebute: \u201cQuite honestly, Nigerians, I am worried! And every patriotic Nigerian should also be nervous at the sustained insecurities in parts of the country which further threatens the prosperity and future of Nigeria. President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has uncompromisingly done so much to secure the lives and property of Nigerians since the inception of his administration in 2015.\n\n\u201cMy heart is weighed in sorrows! That I look behind the scenes and discover that even some serving Northern Governors are the forces backing festering insecurities in the region. What do we intend to gain from this ferocious wickedness of bloodletting of compatriots? Why are some Governors acting scripts of patriots during the day, but wear the dangerous mask of bandits at nights? If our leaders turn to betray us in bloodshed, we should be worried as a nation.\n\n\u201cI have stopped buying national daily newspapers or watching TV stations for news. And the reason is that once you submit to these home media, 80% of the news contents are about violence and killings in Nigeria. Even Somalia, Sudan, Syria and even Middle East countries are not so afflicted. Recent media reports have raised a lot of dusts on plots by some Northern Governors to destabilize the country.\n\n\u201cInitially, it sounded like a joke or journalists flair for news scooping, until I bent down to decode what is happening to us in dark places. My phobia was sealed with intelligence reports fingering some Northern Governors as planning to destabilize the country, with the weapons of terrorists, bandits and herdsmen mercenary killers for the sake of national power.\n\n\u201cIt is the vested political interests of these partisan actors to discredit President Buhari that has further escalated insecurities around parts of the Northeast, notably Adamawa and Bauchi states which have become the new havens of Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists. I know, these political saboteurs\u2019 have vowed that Buhari would not earn any credit on security in Nigeria. So, the fire is pushed beyond reasonable limits, far outstretching the Nigerian Military.\u201d",

          "text": "* Says with new hardware, military more prepared to flush out terrorists\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said his administration would support families of dead and wounded soldiers, and help them realise their potential. Buhari stated this in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, when he addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base.\n\nIn a related development, the president stated that with the acquisition of more capability in military technology and hardware, the country was better prepared to deal with terrorists, especially in the North-east. Buhari gave the assurance on yesterday in Maiduguri after inaugurating some projects donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi.\n\nBuhari, who addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base, said the military had almost eliminated completely insurgency and other security issues threatening the country. He urged men of Operation Hadin Kai, the military operation against insurgency in the North-east, to remain steadfast as they went into the final phase of the campaign against terrorism and other criminalities.\n\nHe urged them to stay focused \u201cto achieve our strategic end-state, which is the defeat of all adversaries and restoration of an economically viable North-east geo-political zone and other parts of the country, where Nigerians are free to go about their activities without fear or harassment.\u201d\n\nThe president told the soldiers that the whole country remained grateful to them for their gallantry in ensuring the gradual return of peace to the North-east. He condoled with families that had lost loved ones, as well as the wounded.\n\nBuhari assured the families of soldiers, who paid the supreme price for the country, and the injured that the federal government would cater for their needs, in recognition of their sacrifices for all Nigerians.\n\nHe asserted before the troops, \u201cI am delighted to be with you today and to convey my gratitude and that of the entire nation to you all, as you continuously strive to secure our dear country. Your career is like no other, because it is a conscious commitment and preparedness to give your best for the sake of others. I am, therefore, here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu, and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021. I do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno State and, indeed, the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the troops for their extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces are known for. Well done. Our country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterised by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people, who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes. Further to the reorganisations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on the threat posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices, the president said substantial resources had been directed to procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal. He said similar attention was being given to intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari told the troops that at the onset of his administration, he emphasised the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force. This was in realisation of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimise the mutual gains for our respective national security,\u201d Buhari told the troops.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North-east region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region. I am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno State, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy.\u201d\n\nHe assured the people that the administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders, including friendly nations and civil society organisations, to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nWhile appreciating the government of Borno State for its continuous cooperation with the federal government in multiple spheres, the president added, \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the state.\n\n\u201cI particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno. Yours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the federal government and states.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended the Minister of Defence as well as the Chief of Defence staff, service chiefs and the heads of all other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation, which continues to enhance operations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the research and development exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s annual conference and the launch of locally constructed seaward defence ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander-in-Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices, which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible.\u201d\n\nBuhari also said the manpower challenges, which had limited the rotation of some units from the theatre, would be addressed by concerted efforts to increase recruitment and ensure that the remaining units due for rotation were relieved as soon as practicable.\n\nIn a related development, Buhari assured that hard times awaited terrorists troubling the North-west, with the procurement of high-tech equipment and hardware by the military.\n\nHe also said he would continue to do his best for the development of the country until May 2023, when he would statutorily leave the presidency.\n\nThe president spoke on Thursday in Maiduguri after the inauguration of Oriental Energies Resource Ltd Hanger, Muhammadu Indimi Distance Learning Centre, and an International Conference Centre donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi, he expressed concern at the level of insecurity in the North West zone.\n\nHe said it was sad that the people of the North-west, who prior to now lived together, sharing same culture and outlook for a long time, would start stealing, kidnapping and killing one another.\n\nBuhari said, \u201c I know I swore by the constitution, and I will leave in 17 months. I pray that the person that will take over from us will also follow the targets of securing the country and building the economy.\n\n\u201cWithout securing the country, you cannot grow the economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari said Nigerians should appraise the performance of the administration based on what the situation was on security, economy and corruption before he came in, and where it is now.\n\n\u201cWe have a great country, and we thank God for giving us so much resources. But we need to develop our resources.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that development would be more sustainable by empowering the people.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am highly impressed with what I have seen at this state of the art Centre for Distance Learning and Auditorium sited here, the University of Maiduguri. I am told that this international conference hall has 1,300 seats. The high quality standard of this edifice is major contribution by Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi. This intervention will benefit not only students from Borno and the North-east but also students from all parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the Oriental Energy Resources Hangar, which I commissioned, it will welcome and offer support services to aircraft and pilots involved with Humanitarian Air Services.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno state for the work he had done in two years, and said he was in the state in June to commission development projects.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum appreciated the president for honouring the state, adding that Indimi\u2019s contributions to the development of the state showed he loved his people.\n\n\u201cWords cannot convey our gratitude for the statesmanship, \u201c the governor said.\n\nZulum said the state had recognised the contributions of Indimi by renaming the Damboa Road after him, now Alhajji Muhammadu Indimi Road.\n\nSpeaking also, Indimi said he was motivated to build the Distance Learning Centre and the International Conference Centre to encourage education in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe the centre will help in delivering training and skills as well as encourage those who will be taking lessons from remote places.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Olori Naomi, Ooni of Ife\u2019s Wife, Announces Divorce from Monarch",
          "text": "Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nWife of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, Olori Naomi Silekunola, yesterday, announced her separation from the monarch, citing many personal reasons.\n\nIn a statement posted on her verified Instagram handle and Facebook account, in the morning, Naomi announced an end to the three-year marriage.\n\nAlthough the palace, which earlier maintained silence, came back to say divorce being a two-way thing, could not be announced by a party, even though there was an unconfirmed account, which disputed the claims of the Olori as untrue.\n\nAt the same time, a Yoruba interest group, Igbimo Apapo Yoruba Lagbaye, has described the development as a sacrilege to the royal stool of of Ife and the entire Yoruba race urging the people of Yoruba to remain calm and resolute to the cause of preserving the sacredness of the tradition and unique value of the throne of the Ooni of Ife.\n\nBut, according to the queen, she had tried to make the union work, unfortunately, the monarch\u2019s public identity was at variance with \u201chis true self\u201d.\n\nThe fair-skinned ex-queen wrote: \u201cI did my best to endure and make it work. Many times, I smiled through the struggle, but I have finally realised I had just one assignment: my son, and when God is done, He is done. He chose Saul to be king, and when He was done, He told the prophet Samuel I have moved on.\n\n\u201cReligion was never an issue between us; please refer to my interview on News Central TV. Instead, His Majesty has a picture he would love the world to see and perceive him as and another one which is his true self.\u201d\n\nShe, therefore, declared: \u201cToday, I announce the beginning of a new dawn and the close of a chapter. Today, I am a mother to God\u2019s unique gift. I am no longer a slave to my thoughts of perfection. I, at this moment, announce that I shall no longer be referred to as wife to the Ooni of Ife or as Queen of Ile-Ife, but as the Queen of the people and mother of my adorable Prince.\u201d\n\nAlso addressing some allegations, Silekunola said her \u201cdecision to move on did not come because his majesty is married to another queen\u201d, but added that, \u201cAs many would love to assume, throughout our life as a couple, I was the only married wife to him. There were side attractions, but it was never an issue.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered from a palace source that up to the time of filing this report, the palace neither denied nor confirmed the true position of the situation, thus putting a doubt on the other account which dismissed the divorce announcement as untrue.\n\nInterestingly, Naomi\u2019s divorce makes it the second since Ooni assumed the prestigious stool. Ooni, on assuming the throne of his fathers, married Olori Wuraola Zaynab Otiti, who left in 2017.\n\nBut the palace image maker, Moses Olafare, who initially declined calls, later said separation was a two way affair and not something announced by one party.\n\nHe said the announcements of separation is subject to agreement by both parties, so, to that extent, the palace was not aware of such separation, because \u201cwe all went to bed last night having the king and queen being together.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo, if by this morning, the queen went to her social media to write that she is no longer in marriage with Ooni, we will look into it to see whether or not the Instagram page truly belongs to her, and to know the reason behind it.\n\n\u201cBut, as at today \u2013 this moment \u2013 the palace is not aware of the separation. Marriage is a private affair, no matter how prominent the personalities involved, it is a private affair. We will dig deeper and know what happened. But, like I said, all of us just woke up to read about the separation on social media.\n\n\u201cEven by this time yesterday, (Wednesday) kabiyesi was still packaging special gift for her. If you want to separate with someone, you cannot be packaging gift for her. I was aware that Kabiyesi was putting special gift for her for Christmas.\n\n\u201cIf he is not in love with her, he cannot be doing that, only to wake up the following morning to hear from public that she was no longer in the relationship. In fact the Christmas gift has been delivered to her already,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Igbimo Apapo Yoruba Lagbaye, an umbrella body for the Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide and Yoruba Council of Women Worldwide, alongside all her affiliated groups, said it was \u201caghast to read just like millions of people from all works of life on the verified pages of social media platforms belonging to Olori Naomi Silekunola Ogunwusi\u2019s Facebook and Instagram handle declaring herself divorced and separated with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe group, in a statement by its President, Aare Oladotun Hassan, said, while her action had caused monumental embarrassment to the throne, \u201cthe Yoruba race and all lovers of the Ooni globally, we deplore this most condemnable act of disrespect aimed at devaluing the age-long tradition of the Arole Oduduwa Olofin Adimula throne.\n\n\u201cWe wish to clarify that the throne had its modus operandi and thorough orderly guiding principles, wherein it is totally unheard of for an Olori Ooni to frivolously and peremptory announce her divorce on the pages of the social media.\n\n\u201cWe have a tradition in Yorubaland that respects and values the woman, however, it seems the Olori failed to realise that being married to the Ooni estopped a woman from public display of tantrums and ridiculous misrepresentation of facts.\n\n\u201cWe are firmly pleading with His Imperial Majesty, Kabiyesi Ooni to look beyond the current travails and obstacles as a passing wind, see the bigger picture of how all of us from diverse backgrounds support and express our unending love for His Majesty.\n\n\u201cKabiyesi Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, The Ooni of Ife, is an embodiment of God\u2019s love for humanity. No matter what evil predetermined picture anyone may want to paint of the Ooni, we enjoin Kabiyesi to keep focused and determined to steer the ship of unity and development of the Yoruba race to an expected promised land.\n\n\u201cWe are using this medium to serve a note of warning to anyone or group abusing or using the name of His Imperial Majesty, Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, in a most condemnable manner to henceforth desist from such sacrilegious misconduct. We have emphatically spoken.\u201d\n\nAlso, another Yoruba self-determination activist, Rasaq Oladosu, said, \u201cWe watch with utmost dismay the narrative in the media surrounding the Oonirisa and his alleged estranged wife.\n\n\u201cWhile we respect the privacy and the rights of the ex-queen to steer her affairs in the manner she so deems fit, it is imperative to note and state that the Ooni, beyond being the traditional leader of the entire Yoruba race, is an age long institution in himself.\n\n\u201cThus, the sacredness of his position and office precludes him from issues such as this. While the Ooni may not be able to make comments in the media, we will not stand by and allow the office of the Ooni and by extension, the entire Yoruba race to be denigrated.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has directed churches in Kaduna State to suspend this year's Christmas Eve services.\n\nCAN gave the directive amidst escalating terror killings and kidnappings by bandits in the state, saying pre-Christmas services, usually held during nightfall to herald the birth of Jesus Christ should not hold this year.\n\nCAN chairman in Kaduna state, Rev. John Joseph Hayap, told SaharaReporters that \"leaders of the Christian body were perturbed by the spike in violent crimes being perpetrated against Christians in the North\".\n\nHe added, \"Yes, we have written to churches to suspend this year's Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve events because of security concerns.\n\n\"We took this decision because the government of Nigeria and its security agents have failed the Christian community.\n\n\"All they do is to make press statements expressing sadness anytime our people are killed; we're tired of that.\n\n\"However, in areas our people feel they can afford to congregate for Christmas Eve services, they should do so under security measures. Even at that, all services must end before 6:00 pm.\"\n\nSaharaReporters on November 29, 2021, reported that a group of bandits had written to the Christian community in Zamfara State, Northwest Nigeria to close churches or risk ferocious attacks.\n\nAlso on December 15, 2021, it was reported that the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP)'s faction of Boko Haram terrorists had sent threat letters to some communities in Adamawa State, saying it would attack during the Christmas season.\n\nTo allay the fears of Christmas season attacks as threatened by the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP), the Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri spent three days in some of the communities under threat.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that Fintiri on Friday, December 17, 2021, embarked on a three-day confidence-boosting visit to the area.\n\nMeanwhile, a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, says the deteriorating security situation has resulted in a humanitarian emergency, with more than 8.7 million people requiring urgent assistance in northern Nigeria.\n\nIt further says, \"Since 2011, inter-communal violence, rooted in competition over scarce resources, has escalated in central and north-west Nigeria.\n\n\"Violence between herding and farming communities has become increasingly deadly as a result of the proliferation of armed groups and gangs who engage in organized cattle-rustling, kidnapping, plunder, murder and rape.\n\n\"The emergence and expansion of armed banditry in the north-west resulted in at least 4,900 people killed between 2018-2020 and has displaced hundreds of thousands.\n\n\"Kidnappings by armed extremist groups and bandits have become endemic in northern Nigeria, with more than 950 children kidnapped since December 2020. More than 200 students remain missing.\"",

John Joseph Hayap, told SaharaReporters that \"leaders of the Christian body were perturbed by the spike in violent crimes being perpetrated against Christians in the North\".\n\nHe added, \"Yes, we have written to churches to suspend this year's Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve events because of security concerns.\n\n\"We took this decision because the government of Nigeria and its security agents have failed the Christian community.\n\n\"All they do is to make press statements expressing sadness anytime our people are killed; we're tired of that.\n\n\"However, in areas our people feel they can afford to congregate for Christmas Eve services, they should do so under security measures. Even at that, all services must end before 6:00 pm.\"\n\nSaharaReporters on November 29, 2021, reported that a group of bandits had written to the Christian community in Zamfara State, Northwest Nigeria to close churches or risk ferocious attacks.\n\nAlso on December 15, 2021, it was reported that the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP)'s faction of Boko Haram terrorists had sent threat letters to some communities in Adamawa State, saying it would attack during the Christmas season.\n\nTo allay the fears of Christmas season attacks as threatened by the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP), the Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri spent three days in some of the communities under threat.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that Fintiri on Friday, December 17, 2021, embarked on a three-day confidence-boosting visit to the area.\n\nMeanwhile, a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, says the deteriorating security situation has resulted in a humanitarian emergency, with more than 8.7 million people requiring urgent assistance in northern Nigeria.\n\nIt further says, \"Since 2011, inter-communal violence, rooted in competition over scarce resources, has escalated in central and north-west Nigeria.\n\n\"Violence between herding and farming communities has become increasingly deadly as a result of the proliferation of armed groups and gangs who engage in organized cattle-rustling, kidnapping, plunder, murder and rape.\n\n\"The emergence and expansion of armed banditry in the north-west resulted in at least 4,900 people killed between 2018-2020 and has displaced hundreds of thousands.\n\n\"Kidnappings by armed extremist groups and bandits have become endemic in northern Nigeria, with more than 950 children kidnapped since December 2020. More than 200 students remain missing.\"",

          "text": "Imagine 100 startups housed in 12 refurbished buildings and located in a large compound with sufficient parking space. These 12 buildings provide 8,820 square metres of space customised to fit the needs of each startup\u2014from a small team of five employees to a massive call centre of 100 employees.\n\nThis project in the heart of Ghana\u2019s capital city, the Accra Digital Centre, is a symbol of Ghana\u2019s ambition to be the startup capital of Africa. It aims to house the largest group of entrepreneurs, incubators, and accelerators from Ghana. The digital centre in Accra is one out of 16 others that the government plans to build around the country.\n\nAn aerial view of the Accra Digital Centre\n\n\u201cBeyond Ghana\u2019s capital city, the government has identified unused government buildings around the country,\u201d said David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on buildings at Kumasi, Tamale, and Takoradi. All the costs and appraisals have been done.\u201d\n\nGetting the project off the ground\n\nStarted in 2011, the Accra Digital Centre project was financed by the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation. It started with the renovation of a collection of 12 old warehouses belonging to the Public Works Department. But due to changing government regimes and interests, the project wasn\u2019t fully operational until 2017.\n\nFour years later, the Accra Digital Centre is living up to expectation and looks to be a worthy template for other centres across the country. Coincidentally, this aligns with increasing startup activity in the country.\n\nThe success of the Accra Digital Centre is indicative of what Ofori, the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, and even President Nana Akufo-Addo hope is a new future for Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has made it a priority to support innovation and entrepreneurship since coming into office in 2017.\n\nWhile Ghana still needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the startup scene is already one of Africa\u2019s top destinations for startup investment. Based on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, Ghana displaced Rwanda to take up fifth place.\n\nTo keep this momentum going, Ofori believes the government\u2019s decision to bankroll this project is important because it helps bridge the gap between the privileged and less privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen things are beyond the reach of average citizens, the government comes in to bridge the gap. Otherwise, the world would become a place of haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nThe perks\n\nOne of the major attractions of the digital centre facility is the low-rent cost. Currently, it costs $8 per square metre, a fraction of what it costs in other places.\n\nCK Bruce, CEO Innovare, a tech consulting company is one of the early tenants of the Accra Digital Centre who doesn\u2019t regret the decision to move in.\n\n\u201cWhen the centre was launched they came around to convince people to join. At the start, a lot of infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there was nobody here. It took some time for things to kick off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c As soon as we moved in, we started to grow. Every year we\u2019ve had to request for additional space; our team has grown over 100% in the past 3-4 years it\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nBy being in a space filled with many other startups, Bruce said Innovare has gotten to do business with other companies in the space and formed partnerships. In addition, the environment is vibrant and motivating for his team members.\n\nAnother early tenant of the Accra Digital Centre is aYo, an affordable insurance product by MTN. Francis Gota, CEO aYo Ghana, told TechCabal that its attraction was its affordability, and so far the centre has been maintained well. When I pointed out that instead of aYo the space could better serve smaller startups, Gota was quick to clarify that, as a subsidiary of MTN, aYo is responsible for managing its profitability and sustainability without external help. Similar to Innovare, the workforce of aYo Ghana has increased\u2014doubling from about 125 to 250 employees\u2014since it started working from the centre.\n\nWhen I asked Bruce and Gota separately what they hoped the centre could do better, they both echoed the same thing: they needed more office space.\n\nExporting tech talents\n\nBeyond the affordable real estate cost, the Accra Digital Centre organises activities and programs to educate people and spur innovation.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a hand in instigating and nudging people towards a digital future. A lot of people are still wired to go to school, and afterwards get a job. Yet they have access to a smartphone and the internet to learn,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThese activities and programmes at the digital centre are facilitated by the tech club and Innovation Hub. The activities involve getting people to try their hands on real tools like drone technology, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality. The best part of these programmes is that they are free to the public.\n\nIn the long run, these activities are meant to position Ghana as a major exporter of tech talents in Africa, starting with neighbouring countries like Liberia, Gambia, and Togo.\n\n\u201cTalents are a critical resource, and we can\u2019t keep relying on foreigners to take the lead in these areas.\u201d\n\nA private company owned by the government\n\nThe Accra Digital Centre is managed by a private company called Ghana Digital Centres Limited, under the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation. To ensure that the Accra Digital Centre functions properly, it is a private company that is 100% owned by the government of Ghana. This was done to demonstrate confidence in the private sector because people often aren\u2019t comfortable doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s job is to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. The government\u2019s core business is to bring in regulations and look out for the interest of the society and make sure there\u2019s no unfair competition,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThe government is responsible for the initial setup of the digital centres and afterwards, the revenue generated from the operations of the centre is used to run them. This way the project is self-sustaining and not a burden on taxpayers. On the flip side, the goal isn\u2019t for the digital centres to become massively profit-oriented, else it\u2019d deviate from its purpose of providing critical infrastructure and services at an affordable rate.\n\nStartups are more than websites\n\nDespite all the progress made, it\u2019s been an uphill task trying to convince local investors that startups need more than affordable facilities to scale; they need capital. The Accra Digital Centre is looking to partner with local or foreign investors and investment companies to expand its reach and impact.\n\nOfori explains that there\u2019s a cultural bias that needs to be overcome. Local investors prefer to invest in sectors like real estate and agriculture where the product is tangible, unlike in the tech sector where the products are often intangible.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to a local investor that you bought a domain name? How do you explain hosting? All you have to show is a website,\u201d Ofori said. \u201cThese businesses that seem like just websites today will become tech giants tomorrow. BMW started out as an aircraft engine manufacturer; today, it\u2019s more famous for its cars.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Flutterwave x Wizkid to drive global payments adoption",
          "text": "Before Flutterwave\u2019s launch in 2016, many African businesses and individuals had a hard time paying for services from companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, subscribing to YouTube Music, or Spotify would mean several calls between customers and their banks, or frustrated attempts using debit cards. Flutterwave\u2019s digital payment infrastructure was part of the revolution, which at the time, included Paystack\u2019s web payments service and Interswitch\u2019s upgrade of WebPay. While Paystack was more involved with helping startups collect payments, Flutterwave focused on helping anyone send and receive money via its API.\n\nSince then, the digital payments service has transformed payments in Africa with a number of solutions. It\u2019s taken a leading role in solving payments problems by enabling merchants and banks to receive multiple payment integrations with one simple API. It allows African merchants collect payments from their customers anywhere in the world, on web and mobile. Other than payments solutions, it\u2019s also created several products including Flutterwave Store, an online marketplace for merchants; Flutterwave Grow, which helps users register and incorporate their businesses in the US and UK; and Flutterwave Mobile, an app that allows MSMEs use their phones as POS machines. This year also saw the release of an integration with PayPal, which allows African merchants in 50 countries to receive payments through PayPal.\n\nFlutterwave Send\n\nFlutterwave Send dashboard\n\nIts latest product, Flutterwave Send, is taking payments to the global level.\n\nWith Send, Flutterwave is empowering customers with a product that allows them to instantly send money \u201cin a way that\u2019s convenient to the recipient\u201d. According to Flutterwave, users will be able to process payments\u2014in over 150 currencies\u2014in 40+ countries. Merchants, for example, can use Send to process payments to contractors and employees all over the world. Individuals can use it to top up their bank accounts, allowing constant access to financial services regardless of location. \u201cSend is finding yourself in Nairobi and being able to add your US-issued bank card to a product that will allow you to patronise local businesses straight to their mPesa wallet,\u201d Flutterwave announced.\n\nThe Essence of Flutterwave Send\n\nAt the helm of Flutterwave Send is Afrobeats artiste, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun\u2014popularly known as Wizkid\u2014who was signed on as Flutterwave\u2019s global brand ambassador.\n\nLike Flutterwave, superstar WizKid has also risen to global fame in the past decade. Around the same time Flutterwave was building blocks for its now widely used service in 2016, starboy Wizkid had just started receiving worldwide recognition following his collaboration with Drake for \u201cOne Dance\u201d, a song that reached No 1 on US Billboard Hot 100 and got two Guinness World Records for being the most streamed song on Spotify [at the time], and for being the first song to reach a billion streams on Spotify. Since then, the artiste has been celebrated worldwide, getting four Grammy nominations and winning one for his collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nFor Flutterwave, Wizkid will be leading adoption across African countries by drawing his fans in. \u201cI\u2019m excited to work with Flutterwave in bringing more Africans into the digital economy through Send,\u201d he said. \u201cFlutterwave is an African product, a quality product that actually caters to the everyday problems we face back home. For me, Flutterwave is easy and simple because you\u2019re able to send money any time, any day.\u201d\n\nWizkid will help drive Flutterwave\u2019s goal to increase global awareness of the affordable remittance service. Studies have shown that celebrity endorsements help about 85% of consumers gain confidence in brands; 50% of people are more likely to use products and services celebrities use.\n\nSpeaking on Wizkid\u2019s appointment, CEO Olugbenga Agboola said, \u201cWizkid\u2019s story is that of hard work, resilience, and excellence. The way he constantly represents Africa in the global entertainment stage is something we love. As a leading technology company out of Africa, our values align, and we\u2019re excited to have him join us to drive adoption for Send. He\u2019s genuinely interested in our brand, he knows payments, and he understands what we\u2019re trying to solve. \u201c\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

They have mutual respect for each other.\n\nIn full year ended March 2021, the turnover for the two was N771.6 billion for Flour Mills and N109.59 billion for Honeywell Flour, and the combination will see FMN emerge as a true continental giant, amassing substantial value for shareholders and huge economic benefit for Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Honeywell, Flour Mills N80bn merger to boost Nigeria\u2019s food production\n\nFMN, established in 1960, prides itself of being in the vanguard of feeding the nation for the past 60 years.

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

The Solar Power Naija Program is being launched under the Buhari Administration\u2019s Economic Sustainability Plan (\u201cESP\u201d) and supervised directly by the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nThe NSIA-REA partnership will see the NSIA creating an initial revolving fund of N10 billion for qualified developers to distribute and manufacture Solar Home Systems. The fund will be accessible by Nigerian Electrification Program qualified developers under the existing REA and World Bank scheme that guides technical qualification and provides grants for developers to invest and participate in Off-Grid Electrification projects. The REA under the Ministry of Power will provide technical and advisory support to the NSIA as it rolls out the program.\n\nThis investment by NSIA is targeted at catalysing 200,000 Off-Grid connections in the first instance with a goal of reaching over 500,000 systems as the Fund revolves and is expanded through to 2023. The program is estimated to also create up to 20,000 jobs across manufacturing, assembly, installation and retail over the period. Additionally, this partnership will help Nigeria meet its ESP target of increasing Electrification, this is a step towards creating 5 million solar connections over the next few years. At completion, it is expected that this investment will demonstrate locally that the Solar Off-Grid space is an investable segment of the power market.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership and the programme, Ahmad Salihijo, the MD/CEO of the REA said \u201cthe partnership with NSIA is exciting in so many ways, we believe this investment commitment as approved by the NSIA Board is a harbinger for increased investments in the Off-Grid renewable space that will help Nigeria achieve its goals under COP 26 and eliminate the Electrification Gap in the country\u201d.\n\nMr. Uche Orji, MD/CEO of the NSIA in his comment said \u201cNSIA continues to prioritize climate-smart infrastructure to create access to affordable power to Nigeria\u2019s underserved communities, particularly in the rural areas. NSIA recognizes the latent potential in these communities and believes that access to power is fundamentally important to enhancing the capacity of SMEs in these communities to support the economic growth of the country and employment creation\u201d.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has raised the alarm over the invasion of Falgore Forest by bandits.\n\nThe governor, who spoke to State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, asked the federal government to come to the aid of Kano State and three other states sharing the forest.\n\nHe described the current security challenges in the country as unfortunate.\n\nGanduje called on the federal government to establish another military training base in Falgore Forest which he noted shares boundaries with Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi States and is not far from Plateau State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst of all, I came to see Mr. President and brief him on the security situation in Kano.\n\n\u201cThere are challenges all over the country that are unfortunate, but we believe Mr. President is doing his best with other stakeholders in order to curtail the situation.\n\n\u201cWe need the helping hands of almost everybody, especially governors and chairmen of local governments. We have observed that the security situation now, our forests are the major problems because they accommodate bandits, they accommodate terrorists, they accommodate armed robbers and they accommodate those who are criminals.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State we have taken some measures. We have two large forests the Falgore forest, which is bordering Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi and also not far away from Plateau. In that forest, we established a military training ground in conjunction with the Army. And there\u2019s a lot of military training going on in that forest using the facilities that we have provided.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo, that is helping to checkmate the activities of bandits in that forest and I have requested Mr President to also establish another institution within that forest and that forest will be liberated completely.\n\n\u201cAlso, we have introduced technology within the forest, from the office of the DSS in Kano and the Office of the Commissioner of Police and even from my office, we are able to monitor what is happening in that forest. And there\u2019s effective communication between the DSS and the police and those who are managing the forest; the checkpoints and various places that security agencies are manning.\n\n\u201cAlso community policing, we are making it a very important agenda. The traditional rulers right from the Ulamas, district heads, village heads, ward heads, Imams and major stakeholders; we are holding regular meetings and the security agencies get a lot of information from the local people that is helping Kano State a lot.\n\n\u201cAlso in Kano metropolitan where we have eight mega local governments, we are establishing some technology. In particular, we\u2019re improving the network system within metropolitan Kano. We\u2019re laying over 100 kilometres optic fibre within Kano metropolitan. So that CCTV cameras will be more effective. So that we can manage the whole mega city in terms of security and also in terms of improvement of network.\n\n\u201cWe have also constituted what we call an enlarged Security Committee. Because limiting it to the Air Force, Army, Police, DSS Civil Defence, I think the security network in terms of flow of information, requires much more than that.\n\n\u201cSo we are including Customs, Immigration, Correctional homes, those involved in Human Trafficking Prevention of Human trafficking, NAFDAC, even the NDLEA, because of drugs, even the Federal Road Safety Corps, even our own local traffic managers, Karota, the Vigilante group, all these we put them into one committee where we\u2019re hold meetings and exchange information and they constitute subcommittees that relate with community policing and through that, we have a lot of information and that is helping the system to be effective and efficient.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAlso, we introduced technology. As earlier mentioned, we have the most powerful tracker in the country. Through that one, even some people who escaped to Niger Republic, Cameroon, we\u2019ve been able to trace them and connect with international security agencies for their arrest. So, Kano is the most or one of the most peaceful states in the federation, because of this multi-faceted approach that we have adopted in order to secure the state and we shall continue to do that,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "When was Jesus Christ really born?: The verdict of scholars",
          "text": "By Joseph Castro\n\nThe birth of Jesus Christ is commemorated by millions of people around the world with Christmas celebrations on Dec. 25. Yet, most scholars agree that he wasn\u2019t born on that day, or even in the year A.D. 1.\n\nResearchers have speculated that the Roman Catholic Church chose Dec. 25 because it ties in with the winter solstice and Saturnalia, a festival dedicated to the Roman deity Saturn. The church could also co-opt this popular pagan festival, as well as the winter celebration of other pagan religions, by choosing this day to celebrate Jesus\u2019 birthday, according to scholar Ignacio L. G\u00f6tz in his book \u201cJesus the Jew: Reality, Politics, and Myth-A Personal Encounter\u201d (Christian Faith Publishing, 2019).\n\nHowever, nobody really knows exactly when Jesus was born.\n\nTHE DEATH OF KING HEROD\n\nSome scholars believe that he was born between 6 B.C. and 4 B.C., based partly on the biblical story of King Herod the Great. In an attempt to kill Jesus, the king allegedly ordered the death of all male infants under the age of 2 who lived in the vicinity of Bethlehem, an event known as the Massacre of the Innocents. This occurred shortly before Herod\u2019s own demise, a date which is still disputed. However, most scholars, including Peter Richardson and Amy Marie Fisher in their book \u201cHerod: King of the Jews and Friend of the Romans: Second edition\u201d (Routledge, 2018), follow the date used by Roman historians, who believed that Herod died in 4 B.C.\n\nBut historians disagree about Herod\u2019s actual year of death, and many have argued that the mass infanticide is nothing more than a legend. In his book \u201cZealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\u201d (Random House, 2013), biblical scholar and author Reza Aslan wrote that Herod\u2019s massacre was \u201can event for which there exists not a shred of corroborating evidence in any chronicle or history of the time whether Jewish, Christian, or Roman.\u201d\n\nTHE STAR OF BETHLEHEM\n\nOther scholars have attempted to correlate the \u201cStar of Bethlehem,\u201d which supposedly heralded Jesus\u2019 birth, with actual astronomical events to pinpoint his birth year. For example, in a 1991 article in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, astronomer Colin Humphreys proposed that the fabled star was actually a slow-moving comet, which Chinese observers recorded in 5 B.C. However, Humphreys\u2019 theory has since been debunked.\n\nThe month of Jesus\u2019 birth has also been a point of debate, with one theory suggesting that the Star of Bethlehem may have been Venus and Jupiter coming together to form a bright light in the sky, a rare event that occurred in June of 2 B.C. Another possibility is a similar conjunction between Saturn and Jupiter, which occurred in October of 7 B.C.\n\nThere has also been speculation that Jesus was a spring baby. G\u00f6tz suggests that Jesus could have been born \u201cin the late spring of the year because pregnancies began in the fall after the harvests were in and there was enough money for a wedding feast.\u201d\n\n* The author Joseph Bennington-Castro is a Hawaii-based contributing writer for Live Science and Space.com. He holds a master\u2019s degree in science journalism from New York University, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics from the University of Hawaii.

          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Tuesday, at the opening of plenary read the communication from President Muhammadu Buhari on his rejection of the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill.\n\nWhile making his remark on the letter, Speaker Gbajabiamila said the House would act on Buhari\u2019s communication when the National Assembly resumes in January.\n\nThe letter, which was dated December 13, 2021, was received by the House on December 21, 2021 and it is titled, \u2018Withholding of Assent to Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\u2019\n\nRead the full text of the letter below\n\n\u201cFurther to the fetter dated 18th November, 2021, forwarded for presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Rt. Honourable Speaker may wish to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities. It also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Mr. Speaker may wish to particularly note the pertinent issues implicated as follows to wit:\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts. The addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitable lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\n\n\u201cThe indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation are that it will raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy. It will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries. This is not healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card carrying members of any political party. Thus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general elections as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\n\nThe proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of Litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of Law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing Constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. This real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral program of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of government in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general elections. The direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over-monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries are also subject or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership Register or valid means of identification which therefore means non-members can be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome. Rival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\nIt further read, \u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\u201cAsides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association. It is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially in circumstances like ours where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primary to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Rt. Honourable Speaker, the assurance of my highest deration and esteem.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) and the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), two critical federal government agencies investigating the recent oil blowout on an Aiteo facility in Bayelsa, have linked the leak to sabotage.\n\nDuring a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the Santa Barbara River, Nembe, both organisations agreed that the wind valve may have been tampered with by yet to be identified persons, leading to the spill.\n\nNOSDRA is the federal government agency responsible for monitoring and responding to oil spills in Nigeria and acts between oil companies and communities at the local and state level.\n\nEarlier, the Minister of State for the Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, had set up the body to ascertain the cause of the spill, the volume and impacted area.\n\nUsually, a JIV is convened by the operator of the affected facility and comprises representatives of the oil firm, affected communities, regulators and state ministry of environment.\n\nDuring the visit, a representative of the NURPC, Mr. Adetoyinbo Adeyemi, stated that physical examination of the failed wellhead from an engineering point of view indicate that the pressure from the asset was not enough to blow the well.\n\nHe argued that the wind valve which he said was designed to withstand all kinds of pressure could not have failed if it wasn\u2019t tampered with, explaining that the fact that the facility wasn\u2019t even producing at the time, made it even more improbable to suspect any other cause.\n\n\u201cWe are here to establish the cause of the incident that happened at the Santa Barbara well 1. From the findings, you can see that there\u2019s no spill anymore. Where the spill came out from is from the wind valve.\n\n\u201cThe wind valve has been replaced now. That means that the wind valve the way it was, is not designed to fail like that because there are bolts surrounding it, well designed to keep the pressure in place.\n\n\u201cSo, if it had not been taken off, there is no way it could have moved from there. When it was reported initially, there was no valve in that place and it could not be found. So, to us, it is an act of sabotage.\n\n\u201cBefore that well\u2019s assembly was designed, it was done to take care of any pressure from that well and as you know, the well had not been producing for a long time, and there was no pressure to take off the valve because they are called the barriers to ensure that such an environment where it has been installed is not affected.\n\n\u201cSo, if you are trying to compare an apple with an orange, it\u2019s going to be a wrong thing. Another thing is that if you can go back and read, you will find out the valve is not designed to fail except somebody goes there to mess it up,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso, NOSDRA\u2019s Ismail Baba-Ahmed, traced the leak to the same cause, stressing that from his expertise on fluid mechanics and his interactions with the wellhead experts who plugged the leak, only vandalism could have led to the blowout.\n\nHe explained that he gathered from the wellhead engineers that the threading on the wellhead casing where the valve was removed was not worn out, a development that suggested that the leak was not caused by pressure.\n\nThe leak which was reported on November 5, was plugged on December 8, with some 16, 000 barrels of crude and crude sediments said to have been recovered from the site.\n\nThe well, which was acquired from Shell by Aiteo has had a life of 20 years so far, but was shut in at the time the blowout happened.\n\nOfficials of the company alleged that some persons who claimed to have been on surveillance duty had been arrested earlier by security agents near the site and are currently being interrogated.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
